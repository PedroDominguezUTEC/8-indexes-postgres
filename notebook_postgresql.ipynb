       "        <td>Trump Announces Plan That Does Little to Resolve His Conflicts of Interest</td>\n",
       "        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald Trump will not be taking necessary steps to resolve his conflicts of interest before he takes office. At his press conference today —  his first since June 2016 —  Trump and his lawyer Sheri Dillon laid out the plans that they claimed would resolve the questions about conflicts of interest that have dogged the   since he was elected. Instead, what they announced were piecemeal steps that, though designed and packaged to mitigate the appearance of conflicts of interest, do almost nothing to substantively address concerns that his business entanglements will undermine his ability to faithfully execute the office of the presidency. The first of these steps, presaged by numerous reports from both within and outside the Trump Organization and his transition team, was to relinquish his official leadership roles within his company. In his stead, Trump’s two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, will be running    operations with a longtime associate of their father’s, with what so far amounts to a   assurance that they will not discuss any aspect of the business with the  . As has been previously written numerous times, such an arrangement does nothing to actually mitigate conflicts of interest Trump’s relationship to his sons, who are members of his transition team, among his closest advisers, and, perhaps most importantly, his children, is far too close for their stated arrangement to qualify as a blind trust. Additionally, Dillon’s description of how Trump will divorce himself from knowledge of their dealings does little to resolve the overarching problem of his   knowledge of his empire. The president’s holdings both in the United States and around the world are vast and highly visible it is unreasonable to assert that reducing official reports to just the company’s overall profits and losses will prevent him from knowing if a policy or position will be beneficial to his company, a problem to which Dillon herself alluded by asserting that the   “can’t   he owns Trump Tower. ” Similarly, Trump intends to create two positions, one within the government and one within his company, to act as ethical watchdogs over his behavior. These roles offer little reassurance unless the   or someone on his team spells out a   way by which Trump will be held to these standards. In fact, arguably the only one of the many steps Trump and Dillon announced that will actually reduce the potential for conflicts of interest is their pledge that the Trump Organization would be pursuing no new foreign deals while Trump is in office. However, considering that Trump had previously promised no new deals, period, and considering the numerous properties and deals already underway around the world, the promise does little to assuage concerns that Trump’s business will influence his presidency. Dillon offered two preemptive defenses against the ethical and legal questions that Trump is likely to take once he takes office. The first is a reading of the   Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which makes it illegal for federal officeholders to “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign state. ” According to Dillon, agents of foreign governments staying at Trump hotels do not violate this clause because it does not apply to “  exchanges,” and “no one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. ” This, it should be said, is a minority position. Numerous experts, most notably Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics lawyers for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, and the constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe, have already voiced their disagreements in no uncertain terms, stating without reservation that Trump’s continued ownership of his properties will violate the Constitution the day he enters office. Moreover, the workaround Trump’s legal team has apparently created —  donating profits from foreign governments’ payments to the U. S. Treasury —  does nothing to change the fact that governments will likely attempt to curry favor with the president through his hotel, as he may view that as flattering, not to mention the hotel will still collect revenues on the stay. Their second defense was one that Trump has repeatedly asserted since the election: The law barring   officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties does not apply to the president or vice president. In this regard, they are correct the law, passed in 1989, exempts the two chief executives from    rules on the understanding that their purview is so broad that it would be almost impossible for them to completely disentangle themselves. Regardless, legality does not imply propriety. Unless Trump acts to put actual distance between himself and his business ventures —  and today’s press conference seems to indicate that he won’t —  these questions will likely continue throughout his time in the Oval Office. Already, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Michael Shaub, has declared Trump’s plans insufficient, remarking, “I don’t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States,” and a number of Senate Democrats have introduced legislation that would force Trump to divest or face impeachment. Below is an attempt to catalogue the more   examples of conflicts of interest that have emerged so far the most recent entries appear at the top. Those Indonesian Politicians, Despite   Donald Trump’s assurance that he has stopped pursuing deals since the election, his namesake organization is currently moving forward with a pair of projects in Indonesia. According to The New York Times, the two properties that will bear the Trump name, one overlooking a Hindu temple in Bali and the other abutting a theme park in West Java, presented ethical problems even before the election. To begin with, through his Indonesian partner on the projects, the billionaire media mogul Hary Tanoesoedibjo (known in Indonesia as Hary Tanoe) Trump has forged relationships with several top Indonesian politicians. One such leader is Setya Novanto, the speaker of the country’s House of Representatives who temporarily lost his post for trying to extort $4 billion from the American mining company   (a company which counts Carl Icahn, who will be serving as a special adviser in Trump’s administration, among its largest shareholders, and which has been frequently criticized by labor advocates and environmentalists). Trump had lunch with Novanto and several other Indonesian politicians during the campaign in September 2015 to discuss the Trump Organization’s planned expansion into Indonesia. At a   press conference, Trump pulled Novanto in front of the cameras, calling him “an amazing man” and “one of the most powerful men” and asserting, “we will do great things for the United States. ” (It is unclear exactly whom Trump meant when he used the word “we. ”) Trump then asked Novanto to confirm that “they like me in Indonesia,” which Novanto did. Another of the politicians who attended the lunch with Trump is Fadli Zon, the vice chairman of Indonesia’s House of Representatives, whse district includes one of the cities in which one of the   properties will be built. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Zon is associated with a political movement seeking to unseat and jail the current governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known by his nickname, Ahok, and has spoken at rallies against Ahok. The   movement is rooted partly in centuries of ethnic tension within the country: Ahok is both Christian, which has made him the target of attacks by hardline clerics claiming to represent Indonesia’s Muslim majority, and a member of the country’s historically oppressed Chinese minority, which was the target of a massacre in 1998. Aside from an interim governor appointed half a century ago, Ahok is the first governor of Jakarta to fall into either category, and is currently on trial for blasphemy for allegedly insulting the Koran, although Ahok’s supporters claim that it is Ahok’s accusers who are guilty of blasphemy for denigrating Ahok’s Christianity. Both Trump’s question to Novanto and Zon’s presence at the meeting underscore another difficulty the   introduces into the United States’ relations with Indonesia. Indonesia is both the largest predominantly Muslim country in the world and the nation with the largest population of Muslims. Novanto received significant blowback for his statement that, yes, Indonesians do like Trump, because it turns out that, no, many Indonesians don’t like Trump, in large part because of his     proposal to ban Muslims from immigrating to the U. S. in fact, faced with mounting criticism, Novanto’s party apologized not only for Novanto’s statement but also for his mere attendance at the luncheon. Since Trump’s victory, both Novanto and Zon have stood up for the   arguing that Trump’s hardline stance toward Muslim immigration was merely campaign rhetoric and not actually reflective of the  ’s own beliefs, something Novanto claimed Trump personally assured him was the case. Regardless, it is clear that the Trump Organization’s planned expansion into Indonesia —  which, again, is the reason Trump met with Novanto and Zon in the first place —  could introduce major complications into the relationship between the   and the political leaders of the world’s largest Muslim country, not to mention a significant trade partner and an important ally in the South China Sea region. As if that weren’t enough, Tanoe himself has shown increasing interest in becoming involved in Indonesian politics. In 2014, Tanoe publicly supported the retired general Prabowo Subianto in the nation’s presidential election Subianto lost to the country’s current leader, Joko Widodo. Then, in 2015, he helped found a new political party, the United Indonesia Party, or Partai Perindo, which intends to field candidates for national office in the near future, including Tanoe himself: Shortly after The New York Times reported on the project, Tanoe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that, “If there is no one I can believe who can fix the problems of the country, I may try to run for president. ” If Tanoe does so, it will create the possibility that Trump will be dealing with a head of state with whom he has shared business interests, which, as Richard Painter told The New York Times, “makes it impossible to conduct diplomacy in an evenhanded manner” —  especially considering that, after Trump’s election, stock in Tanoe’s company rose significantly. Moreover, Tanoe, like Ahok, is both Christian and ethnically Chinese, which some insiders consider an obstacle to his electoral chances, although Tanoe argues that it is not Ahok’s religion but his lack of firm leadership that has led to the   protests against the governor. Nevertheless, if Tanoe does choose to run for office, it is difficult to see how his race, religion, and business partnership with a   many see as blatantly Islamophobic could do anything other than create further difficulties both within Indonesia and in the country’s relationship with the U. S.. In other words, even though Trump’s projects in Indonesia are only in the planning phase, they have already created a remarkably complicated situation among the   and politicians and businesspeople involved in the country’s political scandals and ethnic divisions. Even if Trump avoids active involvement in the   process for the properties in Bali and Java, he will likely still be profiting off of them, jeopardizing his ability to appropriately interact with the nation’s leadership.  Back to table of contents, That Emirati Businessman, Though the biggest controversy over the New Year’s Eve celebration at    Trump’s Florida estate, was apparently whether or not Joe Scarborough could accurately be described as having “partied” there, video footage taken by a guest and obtained by CNN the next day brought renewed scrutiny to   Donald Trump’s own presence at the event. During a   speech given in front of the party’s   attendees, Trump praised his Emirati business partner Hussain Sajwani and Sajwani’s family, saying, “The most beautiful people from Dubai are here tonight, and they’re seeing it and they love it. ” CNN identifies Sajwani as a “billionaire developer in Dubai” who has “paid Trump millions of dollars to license the Trump name for golf courses in Dubai. ” Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, defended the remarks by clarifying that the   and Sajwani “had no formal meetings of professional discussions. Their interactions were social. ” Whether or not Hicks’s statement was true, Trump’s commendation of Sajwani is part of a pattern in which the   praises his business partners in ways that suggest he has little interest in extricating himself from his company’s interests. Previously, he has   business partners in Turkey and Argentina while on official calls with the countries’ leaders he also met, and took photos, with associates from India shortly after the election. Moreover, as with several of the countries in which   buildings are located, the United Arab Emirates has a questionable record on human rights Human Rights Watch specifically states that the nation “uses its affluence to mask the government’s   problems. ” By singling out Sajwani, Trump also runs headlong into accusations that he and his family are selling access to his administration through their organization and family foundations. According to Politico, tickets to celebrate with the   at    went for upwards of $500 the stated attendance of at least 800 people means that the Trump Organization made at least $400, 000 off of ticket sales for the event. (There is no indication that the party was a fundraiser for any outside organization, such as a charity or campaign fund, as is often the case when politicians attend such an event.) Whether or not the   sees it as such, the event offered attendees the opportunity to be in the same room as Trump and bend his ear for a price. This follows consternation regarding an auction for a    meeting with Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and a charity event that offered a reception with the   and a hunting trip with his two sons, both of which have since been cancelled, as well as ongoing speculation that foreign entities will attempt to curry favor with Trump by booking rooms and events at his hotel in Washington, D. C. That Trump singled out Sajwani at the New Year’s Eve party lends credence to these concerns —  it’s an instance of someone receiving the  ’s attention simply by buying a ticket to one of his events.  Back to table of contents, That Virginia Vineyard, Among the dozens of properties   Donald Trump owns is Trump Vineyard Estates and Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, the source of his namesake wine. Since Trump was elected, the property has requested temporary   visas for six foreign workers, according to The Washington Post. The visas, which are administered by the Citizenship and Immigration Services wing of the Department of Homeland Security, allow businesses to temporarily hire foreign, unskilled workers provided that the employer proves that there are not enough domestic candidates to fulfill a   or seasonal shortage and that the hiring will not depress wages for U. S.  employees. Trump, of course, will be in charge of appointing a new Secretary of Homeland Security once he assumes the presidency, which gives Trump authority over the very department responsible for deciding whether to grant the visas that the vineyard has requested. His current nominee, retired general John Kelly, has a relatively scant track record when it comes to immigration, leaving open the question of how much influence Trump himself will have over the DHS’s policy on the matter. On top of the fact that Trump will soon be able to influence the outcome of the request, that his organization has continued to request visas after his election underscores a tension in the  ’s stance on immigration. From the moment that he announced that he would be running for president, Trump made antagonism toward immigration the central aspect of his campaign, arguing that both legal and illegal immigrants are taking jobs that should be filled by   Americans and depressing wages for others. Though he did not specifically single out the   visa, the   has on multiple occasions spoken critically about the   program, which enables employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for skilled jobs like those in the tech industry. But the Trump Organization has long been a beneficiary of immigrant labor. For example, according to a Reuters report from August 2015, nine companies of which Trump is the majority owner have requested at least 1, 100 foreign visas since 2000. The majority of these requests were from Trump’s    Club in Florida, which has requested at least 787 foreign visas since 2006, including 70 applications in 2015. (Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that, since 2010, only 17 of the nearly 300 domestic applicants for positions at the    have been hired.) The Trump Organization also famously may have benefited from illegal immigration: There is significant evidence that many of the Polish construction workers at the Trump Tower construction site in New York in 1980 were in the country illegally. In other words, Trump’s track record includes not just taking advantage of the very visa process he claims to abhor but also actually subverting existing law for his own profit. Now, by applying for visas for his vineyard, Trump is signaling that he expects that his business will continue to be able to profit from one of the very immigration programs he continually denounces.  Back to table of contents, That Las Vegas Labor Dispute, On top of owning various properties and enterprises, Trump and his company employ roughly 34, 000 people, according to an analysis by CNN. On December 21, several hundred of those workers resolved  a labor dispute against the   —  one in which, had it continued for even a few weeks more, Trump would have had the unprecedented power to make appointments to affect its outcome. Here’s the situation: In October 2015, several hundred employees, primarily housekeeping staff, at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas voted to join the local branch of the Culinary Workers Union. Trump Ruffin Commercial LLC, which owns the hotel and is itself owned by Trump and the casino magnate Phil Ruffin, contested the vote, first by enlisting an   consulting firm (for whose services it paid $500, 000) and then by filing complaints with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Shortly before the election, the NLRB not only rejected Trump and Ruffin’s complaints but also found that, because the pair had refused to negotiate with the nascent union, they had violated federal law and their hotel was operating illegally. Trump and Ruffin have since appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On December 21, more than a year after the hotel’s workers first voted to join the union, the workers announced that they arrived at their first first   contract, achieved, according to an employee quoted in ThinkProgress, despite significant pressure from ownership that attempting to unionize would cost workers their jobs. According to the union, the new agreement “will provide the employees with annual wage increases, a pension, family health care, and job security” comparable to that of other Las Vegas hotels. Moreover, the Culinary Workers Union’s parent organization, UNITE HERE, has reached an agreement to represent workers at Trump’s   hotel in Washington, D. C.. Although this dispute has been resolved, it is included here because it exemplifies the type of situation in which Trump’s business interests are likely to overlap with his duties as president. Once he assumes office, Trump will be tasked with appointing members to fill current openings on the NLRB, the very body that ruled against him shortly before the election and will be tasked with resolving any future disputes between the hotel’s owners and its employees. Moreover, as Slate noted, the chief justice of the D. C. Court of Appeals is none other than Merrick Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court has spent months languishing in the   Congress and will likely be withdrawn once Trump becomes president. Finally, if disputes of this nature go beyond the Court of Appeals, the case would go to the Supreme Court, to which Trump will be appointing a justice once he assumes office, which is expected to tip the balance decisively in a more conservative (and likely  ) direction. In other words, no matter how far up the chain future disputes of this nature go, Trump’s presidency will give him new power to influence the results.  Back to table of contents, That Kuwaiti Event, According to an anonymous source and documents obtained by ThinkProgress, representatives from the Trump Organization pressured the ambassador of Kuwait to hold its embassy’s annual celebration of the country’s independence at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D. C. The event, held annually on February 25, was originally scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown the location was allegedly changed after members of the Trump Organization contacted the country’s ambassador. ThinkProgress’s source “described the decision as political,” suggesting that the embassy chose to relocate the event in an effort to curry favor with the  . The Kuwaiti ambassador has since disputed the report, telling The Washington Post that he had not been contacted by the Trump Organization and that the move “was solely done with the intention of providing our guests with a new venue. ” If ThinkProgress’s account is correct, Kuwait’s decision represents an escalation of a situation that has been developing since Trump’s election. The Trump International Hotel has been the subject of continual scrutiny for the conflict of interest it poses, in part because its lease explicitly bars elected officials from holding it, but mainly because Trump’s ownership of the hotel will almost definitely result in a violation of the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the president from receiving payments from foreign powers —  something that will arguably be happening any time a foreign government books a room at the hotel. Already, the hotel has begun advertising itself as a destination for diplomats and dignitaries, and the embassies of Azerbaijan and Bahrain have both scheduled events in the building. However, before the ThinkProgress report, there was no evidence that the Trump Organization had individually reached out to a foreign government in hopes of getting it to relocate an event to the hotel. Back to table of contents, Those Certificates of Divestiture, In addition to the many possibilities for   Trump to pursue his financial interests in office, the unique makeup of his cabinet also creates a new set of financial motivations. While Trump’s own fortune automatically makes his administration the wealthiest in history, he has also surrounded himself with an unprecedented collection of billionaires and   whose investments are likely to also come under scrutiny. Unlike the   himself, those who are up for Trump’s cabinet, such as his proposed Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, will be legally obligated to divest from any holdings which may pose a conflict of interest. However, as The Washington Post noted, even selling off their holdings offers an opportunity for Trump’s cabinet members to enhance their fortunes. A federal program known as a “certificate of divestiture” allows   appointees and employees to avoid   taxes when selling their assets. The program has existed since 1989, and most recently received attention when President George W. Bush appointed Hank Paulson, then the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as his Treasury Secretary in 2006. Paulson was forced to sell off $700 million in shares of the bank the certificate of divestiture enabled him to avoid a potential $200 million in   tax liability. According to The Washington Post, the Office of Government Ethics is currently researching whether the   himself would qualify for the tax break even if he doesn’t, the unprecedented wealth of Trump’s cabinet promises to push this provision, and the financial incentives it creates, to the limit. Back to table of contents, That Carrier Deal, One of   Donald Trump’s first major economic moves as   was the deal that he and Vice   Mike Pence struck with the   manufacturer Carrier, which had planned to move 2, 100 jobs from its Indiana plant to Mexico. Finalized on November 29, the compromise kept 730 of the plant’s jobs in Indiana in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks over 10 years. The deal immediately attracted praise and criticism on both sides of the aisle, with much of the scrutiny going toward the tradeoff between jobs and tax breaks and Trump’s idiosyncratic,   negotiation techniques. An additional detail soon emerged regarding the deal: According to his FEC filings (which, despite Trump and his spokesman Jason Miller’s unverified statements that the   sold off his stock in June, remain the most recent public record of the  ’s finances) Trump holds stock in Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies. In 2014, his investment in the company was between $100, 001 and $250, 000, while in 2015, the stock is listed as worth less than $1, 001, which could indicate that he sold some or most of the stock each year, his holdings earned him between $2, 500 and $5, 000. The paucity of information in the FEC filings makes it difficult to ascertain why his holdings appear to have decreased regardless, the investment is not only one of several hundred but also a relatively minor one among Trump’s many holdings, some of which are worth over $5, 000, 000. As a result, it’s difficult to know how much, if at all, Trump may have considered the stock, particularly considering that he didn’t appear to remember his initial promise to save the Carrier plant. Additionally, Trump does not have stock in the next company he called out on Twitter, Rexnord Corporation (which is also based in Indiana) or its parent company, The Carlyle Group. Still, Trump’s deal with Carrier demonstrates the unprecedented challenge the  ’s conflicts of interest create: Unless he either puts his holdings in a truly blind trust or divests completely, a significant number of the decisions he makes will involve some level of financial incentive for himself as well as for the country. Back to table of contents, That   Issue, Over the past few months, a number of experts have called for   Donald Trump to either sell off his business holdings or, if the illiquidity of his assets prevents him from doing so, to put as much as possible into a blind trust managed by a lawyer or other trustee with whom he will have no contact. Pursuing one of these two options is seen by many as an important step to distancing himself from even the appearance that he will be considering his own financial prospects in addition to those of the nation while in office. In response, Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he intends to cede control of his business to his three adult children, Donald Jr. Ivanka, and Eric, although, as has been previously noted, doing so would barely even create the appearance of a blind trust given how his children are close advisers, members of his transition team, and, well, his children. (Trump has also alluded on Twitter to an upcoming press conference in which he intends to more fully explain his plans, although doubts remain that the arrangement he proposes will actually create the necessary barriers between Trump and his business.) Moreover, even if one does take take the   at his word that his children will be entirely separate from his administration, events since his election strongly suggest otherwise. All three have been seen in contexts that significantly diminish the appearance of separation Roughly two weeks before the election, Donald Jr. met with a   group in Paris to discuss his father’s policy toward Syria and, according to Politico, was involved in his father’s search for a Secretary of the Interior he was also spotted hunting in Turkey shortly after his father’s phone call with Turkish President Recep Erdogan in which the   praised a Turkish business partner. Eric, meanwhile, appeared in photos with his father and a group of Indian businessmen mere days after the election. Officials within the State Department have begun to express frustration with the optics of the Trump family’s current system. Much of the focus, though, has been on Ivanka, whom many consider to be among her father’s most trusted advisers, and the various ways she has indicated that she will remain a part of both the family business and her father’s administration. Ivanka also appeared in the photos with the family’s Indian business partners, and she and her husband Jared Kushner —  also one of Trump’s advisers —  sat in on a meeting between the   and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reports later emerged that, at the time, Ivanka was in negotiation with the Japanese apparel company Sanei International, whose parent company is owned in large part by the Japanese government. A number of outlets have reported that, while Melania Trump will be the official First Lady, Ivanka plans to assume a policy portfolio akin to that of previous first ladies one issue she apparently plans to take on is climate change, on which she recently met with her father and former Vice President Al Gore. Even the optics of physical distance are diminishing: According to CNN, Ivanka and Jared plan to move from New York to Washington, D. C. once the Trump administration begins. That the  ’s children appear involved in both the Trump administration and the Trump Organization presents a major threat to the   norm that presidents should distance themselves from business interests that could interfere with their official duties. Finally, removing himself from    operations will do little to change the fact that Trump will retain substantive knowledge of the illiquid assets involved in his business, such as the numerous buildings and other products that bear his name, especially if he remains in frequent contact with his children. Even assuming that Trump does separate himself from any consideration of his holdings, his children will still likely be major players in the family’s organization, which will still bear at least the Trump name —  arguably one of their most valuable properties, as much of the family’s wealth derives from licensing the name to   companies. Given the family’s     (Ivanka, for example, briefly appeared to be distancing herself from the campaign, and several properties considered rebranding under the name “Scion” when it appeared Trump would lose) the situation epitomizes the way Trump’s, and his family’s, business interests may very well prove inextricable from his actions as president. Back to table of contents, Those Fannie and Freddie Investments, After railing against elites during the campaign, Trump has so far stocked his prospective cabinet with an array of billionaires whose policy positions seem likely to significantly benefit those who are also doing very well. Trump’s putative treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is no exception: His resume includes stints as a banker at Goldman Sachs, a Hollywood producer, and the operator of a bank that has been described as a “foreclosure machine” and once foreclosed on a homeowner over a   discrepancy. One of Mnuchin’s apparent beliefs is that the government should cede control of the mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government acquired during the 2008 financial crisis. The two financial institutions’ stocks rose by more than 40 percent after Mnuchin stated that he believes the Trump administration “will get it done reasonably fast. ” Doing so would be broadly compatible with Trump’s general antipathy toward regulation of the banking industry. However, The Wall Street Journal identified an additional wrinkle to the story: When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s stocks rose, one major beneficiary was John Paulson, an adviser to the Trump campaign and a business partner of Mnuchin’s. Paulson’s hedge funds include significant investments in both Fannie and Freddie. Trump himself has invested between $3 million and $5 million across three of Paulson’s funds, according to his filings with the Federal Election Commission (which remain the only available window into the  ’s financial holdings). In other words, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s stock prices increase —  and they have so far more than doubled since the election on the expectation that the incoming Trump administration will be more lenient toward the financial sector than Obama —  Trump’s portfolio benefits. Back to table of contents, That Phone Call With Taiwan, When news first emerged that the   spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   on December 2, the immediate reaction was uproar over his apparently impetuous breach of decades of U. S. protocol toward China and Taiwan. As my colleague David Graham explained, since 1979, the United States has participated in the “artful diplomatic fiction” of officially recognizing the mainland People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate Chinese government while maintaining loose, unofficial recognition of —  and significant economic and military ties to —  Taiwan. That Trump would speak to the president of Taiwan, especially before doing the same with Xi Jinping, the president of the PRC, flies in the face of a diplomatic tradition that has undergirded almost 40 years of U. S.  relations. Amid the days of dissembling that followed the phone call, an additional worrisome detail came out: The Trump Organization has apparently been exploring expansion into Taiwan. Soon afterwards, the Trump Organization denied that it planned to do so however, even before the controversy arose, the mayor of Taoyuan, Taiwan, the municipality in which the Trump Organization allegedly wants to build, described in a televised interview a meeting with a representative of the Trump Organization in September to discuss prospective   projects, and at least one Trump employee was found to have posted on Facebook that she was in Taiwan at the time on a business trip. The phone call, and the many statements that have followed, are of particular interest because of the extent to which they dovetail with some of the biggest concerns about Trump’s approach toward governance. In the ensuing 48 hours, Republican officials offered several, sometimes entirely contradictory, explanations of what initially appeared to be an impulsive move by Trump depending on who was speaking, the phone call was actually initiated by   (which, if technically true, ignores that it was Trump’s staff who arranged the conversation) was just “a courtesy,” or manifested a policy shift weeks in the making —  although, regardless, it was made without first consulting the White House or State Department. The defense of the move, and the questions it creates regarding conflicts of interest, have largely hinged on the belief that, since voters apparently don’t mind, the reaction was overblown. On this issue, though, whether or not voters care is immaterial to the central question. The   of the United States breached decades of international protocol created to preserve a precarious balance of power. That decision raised not only the possibility that Trump was blundering into a potential international incident but also that he may have done so in part out of consideration for his business prospects. Back to table of contents, That Deutsche Bank Debt, Though he often brags about leveraging   law to become “The King of Debt,” Trump’s numerous bankruptcy filings have left most large Wall Street banks reticent to lend to him, according to The Wall Street Journal. Among the few exceptions is Deutsche Bank, which “has led or participated in loans of at least $2. 5 billion” to the   since 1996, with at least another $1 billion in loan commitments to   companies more than $300 million of those loans have come since 2012. The  ’s indebtedness does not itself pose a conflict of interest, but Deutsche Bank’s ongoing legal troubles very well might. The Justice Department is currently negotiating with Deutsche Bank regarding a preliminary settlement of $14 billion to resolve probes into allegedly misleading predatory lending practices in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis while it is believed that Deutsche Bank will push back against the sum, there has been no public news regarding negotiations since the initial figure was reported in September. Trump will soon be naming many of the officials with jurisdiction over this and other deals, prompting several House Democrats to send a letter to federal financial agencies calling for close scrutiny of how Trump may seek to influence the settlement through his appointments —  although doing so would be just as in keeping with his general stance toward financial regulation as with active protection of his pocketbook. Other Democrats have called for the proactive appointment of independent prosecutors to avoid any appearance of conflict if the case is not resolved before Trump takes office. Fears that Trump may unduly consider his indebtedness to Deutsche Bank in deciding his administration’s policy toward the financial sector go beyond general anxiety about deregulation. Deutsche Bank is undergoing a period of struggle that may have it on the verge of failure already. Its stock valuation has dropped by more than half since July 2015 in January, it posted its first   loss since 2008 and one of its many tranches of bonds —  one specifically designed to be a     safety valve in times of trouble —  has recently begun to crash. In June, the International Monetary Fund called Deutsche Bank “the most important net contributor to systemic risks” among globally important financial institutions. If the bank were to fail, it could have major consequences for not only Trump’s businesses, which would lose their sole remaining lender, but for the global economy as well. Arguably, the $14 billion fine the Justice Department is seeking to impose has exacerbated rather than alleviated these struggles. Based the company’s market capitalization —  the number of shares multiplied by their price —   of roughly $16 billion, the sum would leave Deutsche Bank critically low in liquid assets with which to absorb future troubles. although the institution’s own   of $68 billion argues otherwise. But given the complexity and potential volatility of the situation, it is important for any decision to be free from outside influence, something Trump’s outstanding debt threatens to jeopardize. Back to table of contents, That Secret Service Detail, During the election, the Trump campaign put no small portion of its funds toward paying for use of the candidate’s own properties perhaps the most notable of these expenditures was the nearly $170, 000 the campaign spent in July on rent for its headquarters in Trump Tower. These expenses raised the possibility that, as Trump predicted in 2000, he “could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it. ” Now that he will be president, he may be able to profit off of the Secret Service by virtue of the fact that he and his family will live in Trump Tower and fly in his private jets —  which requires the agents tasked with guarding them to pay him rent and airfare. The first way Trump could monetize his own protective detail is by having family members travel in his two planes and three helicopters. This is not so much speculative as foregone: Over the course of the campaign, the Secret Service, which traditionally pays for its own travel during elections, spent $2. 74 million to fly on a plane owned by one of Trump’s own companies. Once Trump takes office, he will fly exclusively on Air Force One, while Mike Pence will be riding Air Force Two. However, their families may still be flying on Trump’s private planes —  along with their protective details, which would effectively direct even more money to Trump. (Previous first families have flown with a detail, whose legal purview covers “the immediate family members,” but none have done so on planes they themselves own.) A bigger question regards Trump Tower in New York, where the   appears likely to spend a significant amount of time. For the past few decades, it has been common practice for the Secret Service to provide protection for the president and vice president’s   House residences, which sometimes entails paying rent to the officeholder. (Joe Biden, for example, received $2, 200 per month when the agency rented a cottage he owned near his home in Delaware.) But Trump Tower is a unique case, as it’s not in Delaware but the middle of Manhattan. Already, pedestrians and tourists are chafing at the increased security around the building, Trump’s frequent use of which has required closing a block of 56th Street and multiple lanes of Fifth Avenue with multiple outlets reporting that Trump’s wife Melania and    son Barron are expected to stay at Trump Tower for at least part of his term, it appears that the consternation will continue, with an enormous price tag for taxpayers: According to the New York Post, it could cost as much as $3 million a year to rent out two of the building’s vacant floors, meaning that Trump will be making money off of his own security detail. Meanwhile, Reuters has reported that the city of New York is calling for federal funds to reimburse the costs of keeping up a security detail around Trump Tower. This system creates an unusual set of conflicting interests for Trump regarding his own travel and residences. Though presidents as disparate as Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama have evoked partisan ire over time spent away from the White House, whether on the golf course or on vacation in Hawaii, only Donald Trump will actually have gained from his and his family’s travels. And if, while in office, Trump visits properties he owns other than Trump Tower —  his buildings in other U. S. cities like Chicago and Miami, for example, or his golf course and resort in Scotland, or one of the many international hotels bearing his name —  he stands to gain from the stays for which his security detail (and, by extension, taxpayers) may be paying. Moreover, the more his family members fly on his planes, whether they are running his business on his behalf or running interference with foreign leaders, the more the Secret Service will end up paying for seats alongside them. In fact, there are already signs that the Trump Organization has no qualms about making money off of the New York tower’s new security arrangements in more ways than one. According to Politico, just five days after the election, a prominent New York   firm invoked Trump Tower’s new   detail as a selling point for a $2. 1 million condominium, which it described as “The Best Value in the Most Secure Building in Manhattan. ” Though the flier was issued by an outside agency, the  ’s corporation still stands to benefit from increased traffic through processing and other service fees, making the advertisement a clear example of how Trump stands to benefit off of his new position. Back to table of contents, That Property in Georgia (the Country) Trump’s election has had the effect of speeding up development on a number of his branded properties, even when the   appears not to be pulling any strings himself. As occurred with Trump Tower Buenos Aires, the completion of an embattled   building in the former Soviet republic of Georgia is no longer on hold now that Trump has won. The project, which has been in the works in the seaside resort city of Batumi since 2010, was initially scheduled to break ground in 2013, but has been in stasis for several reasons, possibly including the 2013 electoral defeat of President Mikheil Saakashvili, a friend of Trump’s and a supporter of the deal. According to a report in The Washington Post, the   of the Trump property in Batumi has not been linked to a specific conversation with Georgian leaders, and a U. S.  partner on the project has suggested that it has moved forward without any nudging from the government. However, numerous public statements in the days since suggest that Trump’s election was a major factor, including an interview with a   entrepreneur who said, “Cutting the ribbon on a new Trump Tower in Georgia will be a symbol of victory for all of the free world. ” That the property seems to be moving forward solely because Trump was elected suggests his various business interests around the world may play a role not only in his foreign policy but in how other countries seek to deal with the U. S. as well. America’s relationship with Georgia is largely shaped by concerns about Russian influence and potential aggression in the region, most recently manifested in Russia’s 2008 seizure of two regions of Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. With controversy already swirling over Trump’s admiration for Putin and Russia’s alleged role in the U. S. election, some in the   community have expressed trepidation that Trump’s potential deferential attitude toward Russia would prove deleterious for the continued independence of former satellite nations like Georgia. So, if Georgia has an ulterior motive behind the approval of Trump’s property in Batumi, it would be to keep Russia at bay and maintain the status quo in the region. It’s alarming that a country like Georgia may be giving Trump’s businesses favorable treatment (whether he asked for it or not) in an attempt to influence his foreign policy. Back to table of contents, That Phone Call With Erdogan, One of the worries regarding Trump’s many conflicts of interest is that they may influence policy towards countries whose relationships with the U. S. are currently strained. Such is the case with Turkey, whose president, Recep Erdogan, has been cracking down significantly on civil liberties and democratic institutions within the country after a failed coup last summer. Though Turkey has in the past been a vital U. S. ally as a bulwark against Islamic terror, Erdogan’s authoritarian turn and combative stance toward Europe have led to some reevaluation of that relationship. Thus, it was troubling news that when Erdogan phoned Trump earlier this month —  it was one of the first calls Trump received after his victory —  Trump used the opportunity to plug his business partners in Istanbul. According to the Huffington Post, while on the line with Erdogan, Trump relayed praise for the leader from Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, whose    Aydin Dogan, owns the holding company that operates the Trump Towers in Istanbul. Dogan has previously drawn Erdogan’s ire by criticizing the leader in recent years, however, Dogan’s companies, most notably CNN Turk, have shown support for Erdogan’s regime, including broadcasting his first message after the uprising in July. Trump’s conversation with Erdogan is also worth noting because of a number of Trump’s previous statements regarding the Turkish president. Though Erdogan briefly called for Trump’s name to be removed from the Istanbul property due to his proposed ban on Muslim immigration, Erdogan dropped the demand when, after the overthrow attempt, Trump praised Erdogan for “turning it around” and essentially dismissed concerns over Erdogan’s crackdown on civil liberties by bringing up domestic problems. Michael Flynn, who was recently named Trump’s national security adviser, wrote an     in The Hill arguing against offering asylum to a Muslim cleric whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating the uprising, which some have interpreted as a diplomatic overture. Erdogan has also bristled at   protests in the U. S. and the description of both himself and Trump as part of a “ring of autocrats. ” That the two are now talking about their countries’ relationship as in the same conversation as Trump’s business interests further complicates Trump’s strangely effusive comments about Erdogan. It’s worth noting that Trump himself considers his hotel in Istanbul a potential conflict of interest. In a December 2015 interview with Stephen Bannon, at the time the chairman of Breitbart News, Trump said as much, telling Bannon, “I have a little conflict of interest ‘cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul. It’s a tremendously successful job.” That he chose to discuss the towers with Erdogan, albeit obliquely, through his references to his business partners when he has already acknowledged the impropriety of doing so simply reinforces the perception that he may prove unable to separate his business from his official duties once he assumes office.   Back to table of contents,  That Hotel in Washington, D. C. The White House is not the only new Trump property in Washington, D. C. there’s also the new Trump International Hotel, which opened in October and is located just a few blocks away in what was formerly known as the Old Post Office Pavilion. Previously, the hotel played a role in the campaign as the site of the event at which Trump recanted (sort of) his belief that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Now, the hotel is at the center of speculation as a symbol of how inextricable Trump’s presidential role may be from his personal interests. First and foremost, Trump does not own the location outright instead, he leases the building from the federal government’s General Services Administration, an agency whose next administrator Trump will soon be appointing. The GSA has explicit regulations prohibiting contracts with government employees to prevent conflicts “that might arise between the employees’ interests and their Government duties, and to avoid the appearance of favoritism or preferential treatment. ” The Trump Organization’s   lease on the property likewise states, “no . .. elected official of the Government of the United States . .. shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom. ” According to House Democrats, the GSA has ruled that Trump “will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office” and must divest from the property before he does so. As if its location didn’t pose enough of an ethical question, the hotel has already hosted at least one promotional event specifically aimed at enticing foreign diplomats to stay at the establishment while in town on official state business. On the one hand, direct influence will likely be difficult to prove: The establishment is, after all, a   hotel that would have been likely to attract   clientele even if Trump had lost the election, a fact to which Trump and those who surround him may well point in order to maintain a patina of respectability around their dealings. Still, the meeting’s proximity to the election reinforces that it will be worth watching the comings and goings at the hotel closely for signs that Trump, who so often accused his opponent (often without evidence) of    may be using his position as president to promote his businesses. Trump himself acknowledged that his presidency is likely to increase traffic to his Washington, D. C. property. Speaking to The New York Times, the   noted that the property is “probably a more valuable asset than it was before” and that his brand is “hotter” since the election. However, he went on to insist that there was nothing even potentially problematic about his unprecedented situation and that he sees no reason why he couldn’t run both the presidency and his business without conflict. Multiple events since the election have made Trump’s lease on the hotel a central focus of discussions of his conflicts of interest, including among Democrats in the House. On November 29, Bahrain —  a country whose donations to the Clinton Foundation Trump and his campaign decried during the campaign —  announced that it would be celebrating the anniversary of its king’s ascension to the throne at the hotel. Other events announced since the election include a Hannukah celebration   by the Embassy of Azerbaijan and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and a reception for the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation featuring Vice   Mike Pence as its keynote speaker. Numerous ethics experts, many of whom are calling for Trump to generally divest his business holdings, have singled out the building’s lease, which will likely be breached the moment Trump takes office even if he does transfer his company to his children. And on November 30, mere hours after Trump stated on Twitter that “legal documents are being crafted which take [him] completely out of business operations,” Buzzfeed reported that Trump and the federal government were closing in on a tax subsidy for the property that could be worth as much as $32 million. As a result of the increasing scrutiny, the hotel and his handling of the commotion about it have become emblematic of the broader issues surrounding Trump’s conflicts of interest. Back to table of contents, That Argentinian Office Building, According to a report by the prominent Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata, the  ’s first phone call with his Argentine counterpart Mauricio Macri included a discussion of the permit issues currently holding up construction of a new   office building in Buenos Aires. Both Macri and Trump quickly denied the report according to a statement from the Embassy of Argentina, “The subject both leaders talked about was the institutional relationship, and they briefly mentioned the personal relationship they have had for years. ” As summarized in a tweetstorm here, Trump’s relationship with Argentina’s government and business elites —  and the story so far on his property there —  is already long and convoluted. The phone call with Macri was apparently set up through Felipe Yaryura, one of Trump’s longtime associates whose company, YY Development Group, is in charge of Trump Tower Buenos Aires. The day after the phone call, the PanAm Post reported that YY Development Group had been approved to break ground in June 2017 evidence has since emerged that the permitting process is not, in fact, finished, although Trump’s business associates are moving ahead as though it is. Back to table of contents, Those Companies in Saudi Arabia, Even as Trump was running for president, his company was continuing to operate and open new properties. While the most memorable openings may have been that of his hotel in Washington, D. C. and his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, the Trump Organization was continuing to work on projects in other countries, including, according to a report the Washington Post, registering eight new companies in Saudi Arabia during the   campaign. The organization’s endeavors in Saudi Arabia are notable not only because they may further complicate the shaky relationship between the U. S. and an   gulf state notorious for   abuses but also because of how they relate to Trump’s campaign rhetoric. One of his criticisms of Hillary Clinton was that her charitable foundation had accepted donations from governments with questionable records on human rights, most notably Qatar and Saudi Arabia, always with the implication (or direct accusation) that they were doing so to curry favor with Clinton when she was secretary of state. That Trump was continuing to level this criticism while his namesake organization was actively pursuing new projects in Saudi Arabia not only bodes ill for his ability to separate his personal and presidential interests but also further calls into question the honesty and transparency of his campaign. Back to table of contents, That British Wind Farm, As he indicated when he stopped there during the campaign,   Trump takes enormous pride in his recently opened golf course in Turnberry, Scotland. The day after the British public voted for Brexit —  over intense Scottish opposition —  Trump spoke at the property’s opening, proudly touting how the decision’s deflationary effect on the pound would benefit his business. However, Trump also has a second golf course in Aberdeen, where it appears Trump has attempted to intercede in the interest of his own pocketbook.* According to The New York Times, Trump had a   meeting with Nigel Farage in which he “encouraged Mr. Farage and his entourage to oppose the kind of offshore wind farms that Mr. Trump believes will mar the pristine view from one of his two Scottish golf courses. ” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the   denied that the two had discussed the subject, only for Trump to later confirm that the topic had, in fact, come up in their conversation. * This entry originally misstated that Trump intervened at Turnberry, his other golf course in Scotland. We regret the error.   Back to table of contents, Those Indian Business Partners, It didn’t take long after the election for   Trump to be seen in public with international business partners. According to a November 19 article in The New York Times, Trump took a break from his transition schedule to meet with three Indian   executives who are currently building a   apartment complex in Mumbai. According to both Trump and the Indian businessmen, the meeting was essentially congratulatory in nature a picture posted by one of the executives on Twitter shows the four men smiling broadly and giving a   to the camera. However, that the meeting happened in the first place suggests that Trump does not currently have any qualms about forestalling official state business for personal business. On top of that, the meeting raises questions in the   realm as well. The   himself was not the only member of his family there two Facebook photos show that Ivanka and Eric Trump both attended the meeting as well. Their presence serves as a reminder that their father seems so far uninterested in maintaining even the nominal separation between himself and his assets that he repeatedly said he would create during the campaign. Back to table of contents, That Envoy From the Philippines, One leader with whom Trump already has an advantage over President Obama is Rodrigo Duterte, the similarly brash president of the Philippines. Duterte, who has threatened to “break up with America,” told Obama to “go to hell,” and called the president a “son of a whore,” expressed admiration for Trump, noting that, among other similarities, they both enjoy swearing. Duterte’s affinity for Trump apparently goes beyond vulgar word choice. Late in October, Duterte appointed a longtime business associate of Trump’s as a special envoy to the United States, an announcement that became public shortly after the election. This appointment in particular raises questions because it is just as open to exploitation by Duterte as it is to Trump, as the Filipino president could intend to use his new envoy’s relationship with Trump to strengthen the Philippines’ hand. Whichever side the appointment does eventually benefit, however, the situation is nevertheless fraught with conflicts between the three men’s personal and political interests.

While all the other “strategists” gibbered about Trump losing the Hispanic vote, Marlow said: “Trump is growing the big tent.   …     Trump’s policies are appealing to blacks. There are even some polls out there, like a survey USA poll, saying Trump is actually doing fine with Latinos. ” In the Nevada primary on Tuesday, Trump not only won the Hispanic vote he not only won 17 points more of the Hispanic vote than his next closest rival but his Latino vote nearly matched that of the two Latino candidates combined. In one of the few times you might have heard this point expressed on television airwaves, Marlow said that the No. 1 issue for Breitbart News’ 20 million readers, “has consistently been  —   since last year  —   immigration. They are looking for someone who is going to seal the border and prioritize border security as No. 1. ” Obviously, Marlow was right about everything. According to Nexis, that was the last time he appeared on TV. It would be as if, after discovering America, Christopher Columbus reported back to the King and Queen of Spain, but the booker for Ferdinand and Isabella decided that, instead of Columbus, she’d get the guy who never actually set sail for the New World because he was afraid he’d fall off the edge of the Earth into a fiery pit.

That lead has widened from just 5 percent two weeks ago. 3:59: The Great John Hayward: No One ‘Made’ Donald Trump, The problem with all these “Who made Trump?” accusations from the circular   is that Trump’s primary victory margins are far too hefty to be explained by factional maneuvers. He’s not winning by a tiny margin that could be portrayed as misguided dupes, and a healthy party doesn’t see its own voters as “dupes” anyway. Trump is winning because a lot of people are voting for him, including voters from demographics the other candidates were supposed to dominate, such as evangelicals in South Carolina and (if entry polls are to be believed) Hispanics in Nevada. Trump’s margins are also far too large to be dismissed as whatever unpleasant fringe movement a particular commentator prefers to blame, from the “alt right” to mischievous   trying to set up an easy   win for Hillary. A lot of the   commentary along these lines would be far more plausible if he was only winning by a point or two, but that just isn’t the case. [  …    ] Donald Trump throws a lot of sharp elbows at his competitors, but he doesn’t attack his own prospective voters, the way the Republican establishment and too many anguished conservative opinion leaders do. He says he’s going to fight for them  —  not in some abstract procedural or aspirational sense, but in a blunt and practical way. He’ll carve them a piece of the pie, bully the crybullies, and slap some sense into the bureaucratic empire sprawled along the Potomac. His voters give him a pass on the details because they appreciate his intentions  …     which is the ground Democrats usually prefer to fight on. It’s not the national conversation I wanted to have in 2016, but I’d rather try to understand the Republican electorate than insult them into submission, or threaten to stay home and saddle them with President Hillary because they dared to support Donald Trump. Read it multiple times here. 3:56: Headline says it all: Marco Rubio Gets Party’s Blessing, but Not Voters’ (The GOP establishment consultants who only hear what is said in their echo are   for Rubio and pettily insist they will not vote for Trump. The problem is there are many more voters than professional Beltway consultants who lose general elections and don’t know how to defeat Trump because they have never understood —  and never will —  the voters drawn to Trump’s  ) Senator Marco Rubio has persuaded wealthy donors, Republican Party elders and his colleagues in Congress that he represents their best chance to overtake the seemingly invincible force that is Donald J.

The type of disaffected voter that Trump has attracted hates both political parties because they believe Republican and Democrats are playing for the same team. They think Trump is someone who is from outside of the political system and beholden to nobody. He is essentially the jackass who will fight for Americans that the media looks down up and the both political parties ignore in favor of whatever the   interests that Trump is not beholden to want. These voters, once activated and   on a candidate, are not going to decided not to vote because of a “savagely negative campaign. ” A “savagely negative” campaign turns off the No    voters who, like the mainstream media, want politicians to hold hands and sing Kumbaya. The No    are the people with whom the majority of mainstream media members interact with in their social circles.

Unlike virtually all of his competitors, who repeat the same stump speech in the hopes of getting a   message across, Mr. Trump always surprises. And when he does get on camera, Mr. Trump often filibusters, as when a planned introduction of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him on national television last month, stretched into a lengthy monologue. (Ms. Palin, no slouch in the   department, then proceeded to “trump” Mr. Trump, with a   riff on “squirmishes” and “proud clingers. ”) Just how effective is it? Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals  —   Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  —   are spending a combined $1. 5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s bill? Zero. 2:57: Thought experiment: Rubio allies and mainstream media writers who don’t want to concede that Trump won the Hispanic vote in Nevada are endlessly talking about the supposedly small sample of Latino voters. But if Rubio had received 51% of the Hispanic vote, would these same people be pointing to the “small sample size” —  or would they be pushing the narrative that Trump can’t even win minorities in his own party? Bottom line: Trump won nearly half of the Latino vote on Tuesday. 2:57: Sanders in Missouri (not in the South or South Carolina): ”I know in Kansas you’ve got a governor who likes to beat up on the poor!” @BernieSanders shouts to cheers in MO. pic. twitter.   —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) February 24, 2016,  2:53: Clinton also brings up voting rights and says this will be one of the most consequential elections in our lifetime.

And both of those states have Cruz leading by surmountable percentages (note, though, that polling in both states is not always frequent or entirely current). Even if Trump comes in second in Texas, he could still win. Texas is a state that is typically proportional in its delegate allocation but has what the website Frontloading HQ calls a “trigger,” which creates a condition in which the state becomes   . This would happen if a candidate wins a majority of the vote. Should this overwhelming victory not happen for Cruz, and, say, Trump comes in second in a proportional setting, the senator from Texas must cede a portion of the 155 delegates in play, thereby essentially handing the contest and the nomination to Trump. If Cruz can’t win his home state, he has little chance throughout the rest of the spring. 2:10 pm  —    : Reid lays it out https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Ben Pershing (@benpershing) February 24, 2016,  2:06 pm  —   Cruz arrives for his rally.

People feel isolated, helpless, victim of powerful forces that they do not understand and cannot influence. It’s interesting to compare the situation in the ‘30s, which I’m old enough to remember. Objectively, poverty and suffering were far greater. But even among poor working people and the unemployed, there was a sense of hope that is lacking now, in large part because of the growth of a militant labor movement and also the existence of political organizations outside the mainstream. 1:31 pm  —   Trump: Fox should fire Karl Rove.

Dirty tricks, after all, are the modus operandi in our nation’s Capitol. It is a dirty trick to say you are “reducing spending,” when all you are doing is simply not spending as much as you could have spent or wanted to spend. It was a dirty trick when the Democrats decided to use a procedural technique to “deem” Obamacare to have been passed, even though the Senate and the House never voted on the same bill. And it was a dirty trick for Republicans to campaign on repealing Obamacare, but then simply sit back in Congress while the law went into effect. Americans know what dirty tricks look like, and, quite frankly, we’re sick of them. That’s why Ted Cruz, the   candidate, won in Iowa, it’s why Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund endorsed him, and it’s why the Establishment will do anything to stop him. 12:17 pm  —   New York Times: Rubio Gets Party’s Blessing, but Not Voters’.

Via New York mag: The senior strategist for Romney, Stuart Stevens, has been watching the current campaign from afar with mounting amazement. As Donald Trump has become the   —  a position confirmed last night, when he won the Nevada caucuses by a wide margin —  why has neither Marco Rubio nor Ted Cruz gone after him? Stevens, a   Mississippian, was especially vexed by what transpired in South Carolina. Trump picked a fight with the Pope and insisted that George W. Bush deliberately lied to the country about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The message was “part Michael Moore and part Christopher Hitchens,” Stevens said. But no decorated war heroes were sent to hound Trump. In a   state, no one raised the remark that Trump once made to Esquire: “You know, it doesn’t matter what [the media] write so long as you have a young and beautiful piece of ass. ” When Trump turned on the Pope, no religious leaders were brought in to point out that this was an attack on the notion, essential to politics in South Carolina, that faith ought to be present in the public square. “They could have crushed him on that,” Stevens said. “They didn’t try. ” When conservatives have attacked Trump, in   ads and interviews on Fox News, their line has been that he is a liberal in disguise. But Trump’s support doesn’t depend on him being an orthodox conservative. “The way to beat Donald Trump is to go after the essence of Donald Trump,” Stevens said. “Donald Trump is a ridiculous figure. He’s not a particular business success. Four bankruptcies! He doesn’t have a     understanding of policy —  he doesn’t know what the nuclear triad is. You’ve got to turn to Donald Trump in a debate and say, ‘You’re a ridiculous figure. You don’t know what you’re talking about. And this tariff idea will cost jobs, it will damage the economy, just like you bankrupted Atlantic City.’ ” Stevens recalled that after Vladimir Putin said some nice things about Trump, the candidate arranged his entire foreign policy around a   stance. Trump is “like a stray dog,” Stevens said. “Pat him on the head and he’ll follow you home. ” 11:40 am  —   HOT TAKE from one of the country’s leading providers of violence against minority babies: In #Trump’s America, anyone who doesn’t look or think like Donald Trump would experience more discrimination and more violence.  —   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) February 24, 2016,  11:39 am  —   Trump’s first congressional endorsement comes from Rep.

Women in their twenties, thirties, and forties would rally to her the way black Americans rallied to Obama she would run on her own mantle of change. In reality, nobody is that excited about Hillary Clinton, and young voters, women and men  —   the foot soldiers of any Democratic Party movement  —   aren’t coming around. She lost a resounding 82% of voters under 30 in Nevada. Her campaign now rests on the hope that voters of color like her well enough, if nowhere near as much as they like Obama. And that means that when she faces a Republican, she will have to destroy him  —   something the people who will be doing the destroying acknowledged when I asked them earlier this month. “The slogan is ‘Be Afraid.

Bush was responsible for   as an example. “I’ve pointed out the things that Donald is for that I don’t agree with,” he said. “We’ll have a debate tomorrow night, and if there are policy differences we’re going to talk about those. ”  —   7:38 am  —   Video: Trump   Glenn Beck, Donald Trump made an impromptu stop at a caucus site in Las Vegas where Glenn Beck was appearing on behalf of his candidate, Sen.

Now imagine if the sports media (not the    media) treated the   loss as a win. That’s what the   establishment media are doing with Rubio’s “victory speeches. ” They would get resoundingly mocked. It gets beyond ridiculous at some point and will give the   shows plenty of fodder to mock Rubio as a loser trying to claim victories. And that’s probably why he is not giving a “victory speech” tonight.

MSNBC was broadcasting a live look at the caucus site, Palo Verde High School in Summerlin, when Trump suddenly showed up and made an impromptu speech of his own. “We are going to have hopefully a historic night,” Trump said. “I appreciate everybody being here. I wanted to be here myself and say a few words. ” The billionaire informed his Twitter followers he would be “at various caucus sites” throughout Nevada Tuesday, but didn’t specify where. 9:54: Cuomo, talking about the   friendship, asks Clinton who is her Scalia. She says Scalia and Ginsburg actually got to spend time with each other and get to know each other as people. She laments that lawmakers don’t get to do that now.

She says relationships underlie everything. She answers people like John   Collins. 9:48: South Carolina’s poet laureate asks how she will harness the power of forgiveness. Clinton says she could not be standing here if she had not been forgiven many times and if she had not been able to forgive those who had disappointed or wronged her. She talks about the Truth and Reconciliation Process in South America and speaks about the time she spent with Nelson Mandela. She said it was a stunning example of “what is possible” and we could do a lot more if we could “harness those feelings. ” She says she sees so much “anger” and talks about “violent images” and “threats against people” that are “deeply troubling” to her. Clinton says more people should walk in other people’s shoes and being more forgiving is one of our biggest challenges. 9:45: Charter school founder asks Clinton if our students are put at a disadvantage because international students go to school for 40 more days a year than American students.

She says she will prevent Republicans from privatizing it and that has to be the highest priority. Regarding the trust fund, Clinton says “we have to go where the money is” and “have to look at different ways to get more money into the trust fund. ” She suggests raising the cap or expanding the Social Security tax to   income. She says she will do everything she can to extend the life of the trust fund. She says there are a lot of   workers, women who were not in the formal workforce who don’t get enough benefits to get by. Clinton says we also need to be concerned about widows who lose half their benefits when their husband dies. 9:30: Cuomo says   comedians love Hillary. Cuomo shows Clinton her interview with Scott Pelley in which she said she “always tries” to tell the truth. He shows her Colbert mocking Clinton’s answer and says if that’s a question that she would like another chance answering. Clinton says “no. ” My goodness, Cuomo tiptoes around the “drip, drip, drip” re: her email scandal [more proof the mainstream media treat Democrats like their own family while treating Republicans like the enemy]  …     Clinton says she has turned over 55, 000 pages of emails and claims that nobody has ever been as   as she has and says she is “not at all worried about it. ” That’s it, folks. We’ve asked what we had to ask and let’s go to the audience. No grilling at all. 9:30: A questioner asks what she would do to help strengthen families. Clinton says a lot of families are trying to keep “body and soul together” and are under tremendous economic stress. She speaks about raising the minimum wage and equal pay. She says we should do more to help support families as they raise their children. She touts her “It Takes a Village” book and says the   families should help families do right by their own kids. She speaks of more early childhood education and universal   programs. 9:25: Clinton says she will support young people whether they support her or not when asked why liberal millennials are voting for Sanders. She takes the opportunity to discuss student debt. She says students should get free education if they do “national service. ” Clinton says she wants   tuition but not “free college” because her family and Trump’s family should not get “free college. ” 9:24: Clinton says what she got out of going to Wellesley was that women ran everything. She says she is grateful for the experience and was grateful to the women who had been in the Senate before when she got to the Senate. She says there was a bipartisan group of women who regularly met to discuss trivial things like what to do with their handbags and more serious things like women’s issues, childcare, equal pay, etc. [Clinton again    …    . but only Sanders is asked about his  ] Nevada: Family caucusing for @JohnKasich at Durango HS in Las Vegas, #Nevada #Nevadacaucus pic. twitter.   —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 24, 2016,  Just talked to a democrat who registered gop for fun and is voting for Kasich —  ”he’s, like, the only normal one”  —   Liz Goodwin (@lizcgoodwin) February 24, 2016,  Utah’s Lt Gov @SpencerJCox canvases for @marcorubio inside #Nevada caucus at Durango HS in Las Vegas.

Clinton says most police officers perform honorably but “we have problems in our criminal justice system in a  lot of places that we can’t ignore. ” She says put aside any particular   or performance and cites instances like Walter Scott in South Carolina. She says the answer is not to find ourselves in opposing camps where we look at each other with “mistrust. ” She says police should be trained to use force as a last resort. She doesn’t answer whether she understands where the police officers who were opposed to Beyonce’s performance are coming from. 9:17: Clinton says Jim Crow is “unfortunately alive and well. ” She says there are places in South Carolina where black babies have a higher rate of dying than in a lot of other places. She says the infant mortality rate can be compared to those in some   countries. She blasts Haley for not accepting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. Clinton tells the questioner that she has the right to wear her hair any way she wants to and that’s her right. Clinton says that she herself has had a lot of different hair styles. 9:15: An   woman question asks Clinton that recently she has started to wear her hair “natural” and says there have been a lot of racial tension recently. She cites the reaction to Beyonce’s Formation video (remember: CNN chose these questions to be asked)  …    . Clinton says we have to deal with “systemic racism” that is found in the criminal justice system, education,  housing. She says “systemic racism” is also cultural and asks the five women who have lost children to “senseless gun violence” and police action to stand up. Trayvon Martin’s mother and four others campaigned with Clinton earlier in the day and they are with her at CNN’s town hall in the audience. She says it is important for white people to realize that their experience may not equip them to understand what   citizens go through every day. 9:12: Joel in Nevada: Republican voters discuss the options at #Nevadacaucus at Durango High School, Las Vegas pic. twitter.   —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 24, 2016,  9:10: Cruz fires back at Trump. . @realDonaldTrump, showing class  grace, calls me a ”soft weak little baby.”  Hope he doesn’t try to eat me!  https:  .   —   Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 24, 2016,  9:08: Questioner asks Clinton how she would contain the sectarian violence that would ensue if Assad is toppled.

Clinton says that every election and caucus needs to be taken seriously and she is taking “no vote, no place for granted. Cuomo asks Clinton about her Wall Street transcripts because “they have become an issue. ” In a legalese answer, Clinton says she will if everybody else —  including Republicans —  releases their transcripts. She pivots and claims she has the best plans to combat the excesses on Wall Street. Clinton complains why there is one standard for her  …    . [perhaps because nobody got paid as much as she did giving speeches to Wall Street]  …     Clinton says everybody should be on a level playing field. Clinton says “there is no unknown” regarding her speeches on Wall Street [then why not release the transcripts? Already, this town hall is not good for Clinton to general election voters] Clinton says Obama took an enormous amount of money from Wall Street and pushed through  . 8:58: Breitbart News in Nevada: Breitbart reporter @AdelleNaz in the field, talking to   in #Nevada @BreitbartCA pic. twitter.   —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 24, 2016,  At #Nevada caucuses you can vote and leave, or stay and discuss, listen to speeches, etc. then vote.

And most people around the world share that belief. 8:46: Questioner, who lost his father to lung cancer, asks Sanders about cigarette smoking and wonders what reforms Sanders would put in place if elected president like raising the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products. Sanders says he doesn’t know if he would go in that direction but says cigarette smoke contributed to his father’s death. Sanders says the tobacco industry epitomizes corporate greed. He blasts them for having pretty girls giving out tobacco to kids around the world like heroin.

He says it is time for Wall Street to help the middle class. 8:19: Sanders is asked about Supreme Court Justices. Sanders blames Republicans for wanting to obstruct Obama since he came into office. He says the latest effort to block Obama’s potential nominee to replace Scalia is part of a “continuous” and “unprecedented” obstructionism effort. Sanders says Thurgood Marshall was a great Supreme Court Justice. Sanders accuses Republicans, birthers, and Trump of a “racist” effort to delegitimize Obama. Sanders says his dad came from Poland but nobody is asking his birth certificate. When Cuomo asks if Trump is motivated by race, Sanders punts and says he is not a psychoanalyst. He says “absolutely” there is race involved in parts of the GOP base. 8:17: Cuomo asks Sanders why his message has not been resonating with black voters. Sanders says his message wasn’t resonating with anyone at he beginning of the campaign. He says   are becoming more receptive to his message of investing in jobs and education and “not jails and incarceration. ” Sanders says he has specific ideas on how the federal government can play a “major role” in ending the militarization of local police departments and ensuring that they look more like their communities. 8:14: Questioner asks Sanders how private historically black colleges and universities will be impacted by his plan for free public college for all.

Laxalt introduced Cruz to a crowd of about 400 at an outdoor park in rural Minden during the second of four campaign stops hours before Republicans start to cast their votes. Cruz said Republicans are asking the same questions about him that they asked of Reagan back then: Can he win? Is he too conservative? Cruz said the “Reagan Revolution” didn’t come from Washington, which he said “despised Reagan. ” He said Paul Laxalt was among the leaders of a “movement that turned this country around” 5:58: Pretty cute.

Marco Rubio is fighting to prove he can build on his recent momentum. And Donald Trump, with his rivals locked in a battle for second, is fighting for a third straight victory to expand a delegate lead that could soon become insurmountable. Tuesday night’s Nevada caucuses force a critical test on the Republican Party’s leading presidential candidates. “I think it’s the most unpredictable of all the races we’ve had so far. You go in really knowing less about this than any other election,” said a    Rubio. “We’ll see. ” Cruz, a fiery conservative popular among voters on the GOP’s right, needs a spark to recover from one of the weakest moments of his campaign. After denying charges of dishonest tactics for several weeks, the Texas senator on Monday asked for and received the resignation of a senior aide who spread an inaccurate news report suggesting Rubio had criticized the Bible. That was just days after Cruz finished a disappointing third in South Carolina after spending much of the past two weeks defending his integrity. Another disappointing finish in Nevada’s   caucuses would raise new questions about Cruz’s viability heading into a crucial batch of Super Tuesday states on March 1. 5:39: Alex Swoyer on Trump’s afternoon rally: Ahead of Tuesday night’s caucuses in Nevada, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump told his supporters, “Keep your eyes out for dishonest stuff. ” “Dishonesty can knock out a poll very quickly,” Trump told his supporters at his campaign rally Tuesday afternoon in Sparks, Nevada, adding that dishonesty is the “only way we lose. ” 5:32: Marco Rubio Plans Summit with His Mentor Jeb Bush —  by Charlie Spiering: Rubio is planning to meet with his former political mentor Jeb Bush to try to bury the hatchet, the Florida Senator says.

From my   perspective  —   and that of Bartlett, who happens to be white  —   it is preposterous to see whites as marginalized and powerless in America after centuries of advantages. Yet it is neither wise nor fair to dismiss Trump’s voters as racists. Many see themselves as victims of a system that deliberately has overlooked their concerns about immigration, trade, education costs and other issues that have buffeted their lives. 4:43: Sanders campaign will reportedly clarify an email it sent to supporters claiming that Clinton’s campaign was charging donors $27, 000 to attend a Hollywood fundraiser: Bernie Sanders’ campaign will clarify an incorrect fundraising email they sent Tuesday morning that claimed Hillary Clinton’s campaign was charging “some donors” $27, 000 to attend a fundraiser in Los Angeles on Monday night. “It’s no exaggeration to say this is the most important stretch of our campaign,” reads the email. “Secretary Clinton’s supporters are responding: her campaign is holding at least a dozen   fundraisers this week, including one last night where some donors paid $27, 000 to attend. ” After sending the email Tuesday, Mike Casca, Sanders’ rapid response spokesman, acknowledged the email needed clarification. “Our supporters are really fired up about Clinton’s   fundraising, so when we send another fundraising email about it tonight we’ll be sure to clarify that the   donors ‘bundled’ instead of ‘donated’ $27, 000, which is more than the annual salary of a worker making $12 per hour,” Casca said. 4:39: The mothers of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, and Sandra Bland will join Clinton at a South Carolina town hall event. Clinton and Sanders will also meet at a CNN town hall event at 8 PM EST. 4:29: Trump tells his supporters that they have to go caucus for him tonight. “We have a mission. ” He says “and to put it in our language, you have to go vote, essentially. ” He again ask supporters to be on the lookout for “dishonest stuff. ” 4:26: “You are reprimanded,” Trump tells someone in the audience who shouted an obscenity. “I didn’t hear that. ” 4:25: Trump says his supporters are also the “toughest” in addition to being the “smartest. ” 4:22: Trump says he is beating Clinton in the polls and “I haven’t even started on her yet. ” Trump says “look at what we did to various people. ” He says he and his people took out candidates who attacked him like Walker, Perry, Jeb!. Trump says Jeb! didn’t take his call when he called him to wish him the best. He says maybe Jeb! called back and “we didn’t get the call. ” 4:21: Trump blasts Hillary for making a statement about “sexists. ” “She had a rough week with her husband,” Trump says, adding that the “last person” Hillary wants to run against is him. 4:20: Trump says “Hillary needs energy” and again points out that she lacks the stamina to be president. 4:17: According to CNN, the Clinton campaign reportedly has a DDD strategy to diminish Sanders as a   candidate, define him as someone with     proposals, and defeat him. 4:15: Trump rails against lobbyists who target people like Cruz and Rubio.

He jokes that 68% of his supporters would not leave under any circumstances. He jokes: “I think that means murder, I think it means anything  …    ” “My people are the most loyal,” Trump says. “I love you. ” 4:00: Trump says he loves “knocking off bad people” and it was an “honor” to beat Cruz in South Carolina. Trump also cites his support across a broad swath of the GOP electorate. 3:57: Trump says Cruz has never employed anybody. He says he would really like to win in Texas. “I love Texas,” he says. Trump says Cruz is going to go “way, way down” in Texas because he has been exposed as a liar. 3:56: Trump says we are going to be “keeping Guantanamo” and will be “loading it up with bad dudes. ” 3:55: Trump says everybody “is taking advantage of us” because we have “incompetent” leaders. 3:54: Trump blasts former Mexican president Felipe Calderon for saying Mexico will not pay for the border wall. Trump says “they will pay for the wall. ” He says the wall will be impenetrable. 3:53: Trump says having Sarah Palin’s backing has been “so great. ” “She’s been so great. ” He also says he will be the greatest   president that God has ever created. 3:52: Trump says Christianity is under assault. He says evangelical leaders have said that Trump may not be perfect, but evangelicals want a leader like Trump. He praises the Falwells for building Liberty University. 3:51: Trump says he has spent less and he is number one. He says wouldn’t it be a  good thing to have a president who spends less and becomes number one. He brings up education spending and says wouldn’t it be nice if America spent its education dollars more effectively. 3:50: Trump says he is not sending back   donations that come with   letters because “there is no way” you can send it back nicely. 3:47: Trump says he cares about one thing —  “making America great again. ” Trump says he doesn’t get enough credit for   his campaign. “When you go to the voter booth, I hope you remember that,” he says. 3:45: Trump says America has “rebuilt China” and China has “drained us. ” He calls it the greatest theft in history. He says his Chinese friends, not thinking that he would run for president, have told him that they can’t believe the stuff they get away with. Trump calls America’s leaders the “stupid people. ” 3:43: Unlike Obama Trump says he will only have State dinners for countries that treat America well. 3:41: Trump says Border Patrol agents are now his friends and they don’t like being told to “stand back. ” He says we have people pouring through the border and “they’re not supposed to be here. ” He says “we are going to build a wall. ” 3:38: Trump says Hillary neither has the “strength” nor “stamina” to be president. Trump says remember that he called Bush a “ ” candidate and says, “I’m very good at this stuff. ” [Tony Lee: Trump has shown he can attack the Clintons —  and expose all of their vulnerabilities (like the war on women narrative) —  like nobody has done before because of his celebrity and the megaphone that he has. The Clintons don’t talk about the “war on women” solely because of Trump. It’s something that the   GOP establishment “geniuses” have not been able to do.] 3:37: Trump says nobody has committed the crimes Hillary has committed but she is “being protected. ” 3:36: Trump blasts failed GOP establishment strategist Stuart Stevens for giving “advice” on how Republicans can beat Trump when Stevens’s candidate Mitt Romney could not beat Obama. Trump says his hands shake and he sweats every time Trump is mentioned on air during Stevens’s appearances. 3:35: Demographer Dante Chinni, writing for NBC: Nevada’s Diversity Could Favor Trump: Nevada is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse states in the country and in Tuesday’s Republican caucuses, that could favor Donald Trump. That idea may sound counter intuitive. After all, in polls Trump fares especially poorly with minority voters. In the latest NBC   Wall Street Journal poll, only 13 percent of African Americans and 15 percent of Hispanics say they have positive feelings about the candidate. Among whites that figure is 31percent. But results from the South Carolina Republican Primary suggest he does pretty well in counties with large minority populations. There are 28 counties in South Carolina where the white,   population is below the state average of 62. 9 percent. Trump beat his state percentage in 25 of them. The other 18 counties, where the white,   population is above the average, he didn’t do as well. 3:33: Trump slams Nikki Haley for “backing the wrong horse. ” He says he has been nice to Rubio because Rubio hasn’t hit him yet.

In his final rally before tonight’s Nevada caucuses, Trump says “it’s down to crunch time.

Trump says the only way we lose is because of “dishonesty. ” Trump says other candidates made their speeches and ran away. He tells the crowd that you shouldn’t vote for people who abandon you. Trump says “I’m going to be with you all night. ” Trump asks people to stick around for a bit to watch if there are any shenanigans. 3:21: Angry Reid says GOP is becoming the party of Trump: Cruz surrogate Steve Deace threatens to castrate himself if Ted Cruz apologizes again: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Media Matters (@mmfa) February 23, 2016,  3:16: Cruz surrogate Steve Deace really doesn’t want Cruz to apologize anymore  …     maybe he’s trying to top Glenn Beck’s claim that God killed Justice Scalia to help Cruz win the white House: Cruz surrogate Steve Deace threatens to castrate himself if Ted Cruz apologizes again: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Media Matters (@mmfa) February 23, 2016,  3:07: On CNN, Dr. Ben Carson says he hops the race does not become a “personality contest” as the field winnows. Addressing his comments about how Obama was “raised white,” Carson says “go back and read the whole interview. ” He says the “real key” is that many people in America are very “uncomfortable when it comes to issues of race. ” He says he crossed the “PC barrier” and says nobody will deny that someone who was raised in Hawaii with his white grandparents and then raised in Indonesia by his white wife does not have the “typical black experience. ” When Poppy Harlow questions Carson about his “raised white” comments, Carson says “it doesn’t mean anything bad” and it just means that Obama’s cultural experiences are “vastly different” from that of most black Americans. He says that isn’t a bad thing, it’s just different. Carson says he grew up in Detroit and Boston. He says he lived in the “ghetto” in Boston where there was dire poverty. In contrast, he says Obama went to private schools and grew up in affluent environments. (To be fair, Obama has said on numerous occasions when addressing criminal justice reform that he may have fallen through the cracks had he grown up in a different environment.) Carson says he believes that “all the emphasis on race is way overblown” and “this conversation is contributing to it. ” Carson says this flap is a “nothingburger. ” Flashback: In 2006, liberal columnist Stanley Crouch wrote:  Other than color, Obama did not  —   does not  —   share a heritage with the majority of black Americans, who are descendants of plantation slaves. Of course, the idea that one would be a better or a worse representative of black Americans depending upon his or her culture or ethnic group is clearly absurd. [  …    ] Obama is being greeted with the same kind of public affection that Colin Powell had when he seemed ready to knock Bill Clinton out of the Oval Office. For many reasons, most of them personal, Powell did not become the first black American to be a serious presidential contender. I doubt Obama will share Powell’s fate, but if he throws his hat in the ring, he will have to run as the son of a white woman and an African immigrant. If we then end up with him as our first black President, he will have come into the White House through a side door  —   which might, at this point, be the only one that’s open, 2:57: Kasich fires back at critics: Kasich was asked about pressure to clear way for Rubio, others. ”I would hope they’d be clearing the decks for me.” pic. twitter.   —   Kailani Koenig (@kailanikm) February 23, 2016,  2:50: Rubio is Wall Street’s new darling: Marco Rubio’s radical alignment with the financial industry https:  .  from @rortybomb,  —   Catherine Rampell (@crampell) February 23, 2016,  2:42: After a federal judge questioned Hillary Clinton’s motives for setting up a private   account and declared that her top aides should testify, it is perhaps fitting that Clinton visited the set of Scandal last evening. 2:35: Spike Lee’s wife reminds Democrats that she’s for Hillary after her husband cut a radio ad for “brother” Bernie: Just to be clear, while my husband @SpikeLee supports Bernie Sanders @HillaryClinton is my candidate!

But not his campaign manager’s. As Mr. Cruz has elbowed into the top tier of candidates, his campaign has conspicuously reflected the brand of its principal architect: Jeff Roe, an operative with a reputation for scorching earth, stretching truths and winning elections. 1:27 pm  —   Photo by Joel Pollak.

The ACU said in a statement provided exclusively to Breitbart News: Although, Marco Rubio has built a conservative record and has a high ACU rating, he and his campaign have made a rookie mistake. Today the Rubio campaign informed ACU’s chairman that their candidate is unwilling to make time to meet with activists and answer their questions at CPAC 2016. 12:46 pm  —   Huffington Post says Glenn Beck has told Ted Cruz crowds he owns George Washington’s copy of Don Quixote —  but that is likely false. 12:34 pm  —   Ohio newspaper gives Kasich’s rationale for staying in the race to become the favored establishment candidate. The Marco Rubio campaign touted big donors and endorsers including former presidential nominee Bob Dole and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. The John Kasich team touted fewer new endorsements and billionaire backers, but countered with polling that showed the Ohio governor locked with Rubio in some upcoming primary states. At stake: the title of the Republican establishment’s choice, tasked with taking on frontrunner Donald Trump. The Rubio campaign argues their man has already earned the mantle with his    second place in the South Carolina primary Saturday, which prompted Jeb Bush to abandon his presidential bid. Team Rubio’s sentiment: Kasich has no chance and should drop out, and soon. The Kasich campaign argues no one has won the title yet. Only three states have voted, after all, and Kasich and Rubio are separated by only five delegates. Kasich will beat Rubio in more moderate states and will win Ohio March 15, Team Kasich says. Still, the campaign is already staving off growing pressure to call it quits. 12:27 pm  —   “This piece is the first in an ongoing series of essays by women about Hillary Clinton. ” I haven’t seen BuzzFeed publish a brazen advocacy piece for a candidate until this forceful   article. https:  .   —   Dominic Holden (@dominicholden) February 23, 2016,  12:21 pm  —   Kasich with more bantz: John Kasich is performing far better in his home rate of Ohio than Rubio in his home of Florida. https:  .   —   Team Kasich (@TeamJohnKasich) February 23, 2016,  12:19 pm  —   Rubio at the press rope line, via Joel Pollak: 12:18 pm  —   Trump mocks: Unlike the other Republican candidates, I will be in Nevada all day and night  —   I won’t be fleeing, in and out.

While there’s bellyaching about mean Tweets, this is an interesting tidbit: FIX: Does Trump treat the press corps any differently off camera than he does on camera?  Or does he still not interact with you at all  —   or very little? Johnson: We have very little interaction with him on a daily basis, but we occasionally get close. The Donald Trump you see in a small setting  —   a visit to a campaign office, a quick interview backstage, a lunch stop  —   is a different person than the bellowing,   candidate you see on the rally stage. In    settings, he’s charming, softer spoken and rather relatable. While his nasty, mean comments get the most attention, he’s also capable of being overwhelmingly kind, almost to the point of being uncomfortably kind. I’ve interviewed a number of people who have spent a little bit of time with Trump  —     endorsers, dedicated volunteers, police officers assigned to protect him  —   and all remark on how he somehow made them feel like the most important person in the world. 11:56 am  —   Start of the line for Trump’s rally.

By making this very careful statement, Trump keeps the looming possibility of Hillary Clinton being indicted alive. Even if the Obama administration gives her a pass, as we all expect, Trump can drive the DC Media insane by keeping the indictment threat alive through the end of the general election. Hillary’s media will be desperate to put this entire issue to bed after the Obama administration grants her absolution. Trump is not going to allow that to happen, The idea of the Clintons finally facing justice for their sins will also keep the base excited. Once again, Trump is violating all of the DC Media’s rules that are set up to elect Democrats. Like Bill and Hillary’s sordid past with all of these women, Trump goes there and goes there and goes there.  —   10:24 am  —   REMINDER: Nevada GOP caucus is tonight.

[Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich will participate in Fox News’s debate in Detroit Michigan. Fox’s Megyn Kelly will be one of the moderators in her second showdown with Trump. Breitbart News will be providing live updates throughout the evening.   —    —   Kasich says that he is going to win Ohio. He says the media have counted him out since day one. He tells O’Reilly that voters get a sense that he gets them. And that’s why he thinks the race will come to Kasich v. Trump. He says you don’t beat Trump by getting into an insult war with him. Kasich says you beat Trump with   Americans he has the solutions  …    . Kasich says he won’t take VP, thinks the race may go to the convention, where an “adult” will be chosen.  —   Cruz insists that Trump will get clobbered in a general election. He says there is so much negative on him that he may be the only Republican on earth who may lose to Clinton. Cruz says he thinks Trump can say two opposite things in the same minute and believe what he is saying when asked if he thinks Trump is an honest man. He says Trump could say it is hot and cold in a minute and still pass a lie detector test. Cruz does not answer when O’Reilly asks if he thinks Trump is dishonest. “I’m not going to speak to his heart,” Cruz says. But he sys his rhetoric does not match his record. Cruz says his is a “  campaign” because you know what you’re getting with me.  —   Trump posts his “A” grade for Trump University from the Better Business Bureau. He has come under fire from his opponents for having run a scam university.  —   Rubio says Trump has been very good at dominating the media coverage and now that the race has narrowed, people will realize that he lacks substance on the issues. He says this is the most important election in a generation and you can’t elect someone who says “I’ll get there and figure it out. ” O’Reilly says Rubio would have won Virginia had Kasich had not been there. Rubio says Trump has been scamming people over the years and now he is trying to con people into giving his vote. Rubio says “tonight, we changed his position” on various issues and Trump will have to be held to account. Rubio vows that he will win Florida and he doesn’t believe the polls that have Trump leading. Rubio says he doesn’t regret trading insults with Trump because if anyone deserves it, it’s Trump.  —   In a   interview, Trump says the debate was tough but fair. He says Cruz is his primary competition. When O’Reilly asked about Romney, Trump says Romney is a “failed candidate” who “made a fool out of himself. ” He says Romney is a “jealous guy” who would have liked to run but was “afraid. ” Trump says his retort was better. He thinks Romney may be angling to get the nomination at a contested convention because he didn’t endorse anybody. Trump says Romney is a “phony. ” He says the worst guy we can have is Romney at the top of the ticket. Trump says he will defeat Hillary because he has a chance of winning New York and will win in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and add states that other Republicans have not been able to be turn red. Trump says O’Reilly may have to ask his “psychiatrist” about why he has gone negative on Trump. Trump says he heard he won the debate based on online polls. Trump says the best chance to win is to win as a Republican. O’Reilly says Trump’s wife Melania creamed Trump in the ratings on Greta. 11: 10: Breitbart’s Pollak: Rubio Wins Cheers for Answer on Flint at GOP Debate. Kasich says he will take the formulas he has used successfully in Ohio to fix the problems in Washington and restore the spirit of America as he send power back to the people, Rubio says this has been an “unusual election cycle. ” He says if we get this election right, the 21st century can be the greatest era. Cruz says he wants to talk to every soldier, sailor, airmen and marine. He says for seven years, you’ve had a    who doesn’t believe in you and send you into battle with rules of engagement. He also wants to talk to first responders who have  been left behind by Obama. Cruz says when he gets into the White House, “I will have your back. ” Trump says “I am going to bring jobs back to the United States like no one else can. ” He will fix the military, take care of our vets, strenghtn our border” and Americans will be proud of their country. 10:55: Baier asks the candidates if they will definitely say they will support the Republican nominee even if it is Donald J. Trump. Rubio and Cruz answer “yes. ” So does Kasich. Wallace asks Trump if he can definitely say he can support the nominee even if it is not him. Trump says he is very proud that millions of people have come to the Republican Party and “it’s the biggest thing happening in politics. ” He says “yes, I will. ” 10:52: Kasich laughs when Wallace says his campaign ran an ad suggesting Trump would name Putin as his running made. Wallace asks if he thinks Trump is naive about Putin. Kasich says “I’m  not biting. ” Kasich says that in Russia, we need to tell them that we will arm the Ukrainians. Kasich will tell the Chinese that they don’t own the South China Sea and to stop hacking us. In the Middle East, he says the Egyptians know they are on their last legs while the   know they are at risk too.  In Turkey, Kasich says we have to bring them toward the West and not the East  …     10:50: Wallace tells Cruz what do about the North Koreans putting their nuclear weapons on ready  …     Cruz says this is a failure of the Clinton administration that negotiated a deal with the North Koreans and lifting sanctions. Cruz says our options are constrained because a lunatic has nuclear weapons. He talks up missile defense, including   missile defense, while moving carriers into the South China Sea. He says we should put pressure on China because North Korea is a client state of China. 10:45: Debate turns to foreign policy. Wallace points out that Rubio compared Trump to Kim Jong Un as a “lunatic” trying to get nuclear weapons. Rubio says Trump has not shown “seriousness” when it came to foreign policy. Rubio says “foreign policy is not only consequential” but much of our future depends on it. Rubio says today’s millennials have the chance to be the greatest generation in 100 years. He says strong American leadership is needed to make sure the world is not dangerous, unstable. Rubio says Trump lacks the “intellectual curiosity” to learn about these complex issues. Trump says Rubio is “not a leader. Believe me. ” Trump says “they will do as I tell them. It’s very simple. ” He says “we are in a very dangerous place” with a “depleted military. ” He then says we are going to take care of our vets and build up the military by getting equipment that the general and the soldiers want. Rubio again accuses Trump of engaging in insults because he lacks substance. Trump says “wrong” after Rubio accuses Trump of praising Putin. Rubio asks Trump whether he will give detailed answers on foreign policy instead of engaging in insults. 10:37: Rubio says  there should be no restrictions on the Second Amendment. He says it is second for a reason. He says they understood you cannot have life, liberty, happiness without the Second Amendment. He says criminals do not follow laws. And that is why gun laws are not effective. Baier says Trump was once for an assault weapons ban. But Trump says he now wants no restrictions on the Second Amendment and is a “very big supporter of the Second Amendment. ” He says he does not support the assault weapons ban anymore. Trump says “unlike Donald, I would not support banning firearms. ” Cruz says Clinton’s ban did nothing to reduce crime and only took away the rights of   citizens. Cruz says Trump can’t say he supports the Second Amendment and then want to compromise on Supreme Court Justices. Cruz says Trump has written checks to   and any Justice they sign off on will be a   judge. Cruz says we are one judge away from reversing Heller. Trump says Cruz was the primary supporter of John Roberts. Cruz responds that “Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth. ” Cruz asks Trump to breathe so he does not interrupt. Rubio quips that Donald is “very flexible” after Cruz says he doesn’t want to see anyone doing Yoga on the stage. 10:35: When asked whether he thinks gay people should adopt kids, Cruz says adoption is decided at the state level and he would leave the question of   to the states. He said that is how it was for two centuries until five unelected judges wrongfully decided to tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states. Cruz slams Trump and says he will never compromise on religious liberty when nominating a Supreme Court Justice. He says “I will never compromise away” religious liberties  …     Cruz points out that he has spent two decades fighting for religious liberty and says he represented veterans defending the Mojave Desert Memorial. Trump has nothing to say when asked to respond to Cruz about whether he would be flexible in appointing Justices who will not compromise on religious liberty. 10:30: When asked if gay marriage dissenters have rights, Kasich says he tries to be a man of faith every day. He says it is “another issue” if people are forced to participate in something they don’t like. He said he hoped things would “settle down” after the Supreme Court’s gay marriage ruling. He says people should not sue photographer if they do not want to photograph a gay marriage. People should have “common sense” and just find another photographer. Kasich says someone should not be pressured to participate in something against their religious beliefs and we may have to deal with that with a law. But he again says people should just have “common sense” on these matters. 10:28: Cruz is asked what he would do to bring manufacturing jobs to places like Detroit. Cruz says Detroit has been “decimated” by 60 years of failed   policies. He accuses   Democrats of being weak on crime and pushing failed economic policies. He says the media should be telling the story of destructive   policies but they don’t. Wallace asks Cruz to answer the question (he didn’t do that to Rubio). Cruz says he will repeal Obamacare and pull back regulations that are killing small businesses  and manufacturers. His tax plan, he says, (16%   flat tax) will bring back millions manufacturing jobs. 10:25: Kasich is asked about Detroit’s urban blight. Kelly asks if the federal government should bail out Detroit’s schools if it bailed out the auto industry. Kasich says he would bundle federal programs into four buckets and send them to the states. He talks about vocational training and more school choice. He says adults need to fight in our communities for our children’s education and out children first. He says the people in Detroit are going to rise and they need to be involved. 10:23: Candidates are asked about the Flint water  . Rubio says he and other candidates have talked about it. He says it was a “systemic breakdown” at every level of government. He says it is unfair to politicize the issue because someone didn’t wake up one morning and decide to poison the water. He says it is absurd that Democrats are trying to politicize the issue and there is a proper role that the federal government can play to help cities like Flint and to ensure that something like that never happens again. 10:17: Kasich talks about the people who show up at his town halls. They have lost their children. Their wages have gone down. They see the rich get richer while their sons and daughters are living in the basement. Kasich says people are hungry for politicians who can fix the economy. But they also want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live. Kasich says voters are yearning for someone who can bring America together and “reignite the spirit of America  …     so let’s stop fighting. ” 10:14: Cruz asks voters at home if this is the debate they want playing out in the general election. He says if we nominate Donald, we will spend the spring and fall with the GOP nominee facing a fraud trial while Hillary Clinton asking why Trump donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to her and her foundation. Cruz tells Trump to “count to ten” when he continues to interrupt. Cruz says he has “beat Trump” five times and asks people who believe in the Constitution to stand with him and join his campaign. Cruz says that the CNN poll that Trump is touting found that Trump is losing to Clinton by eight points. That poll shows Cruz beating Clinton. “We can’t mess this up,” Cruz says. He accuses Trump of being on every side of every issue. He says the stakes are too high to nominate someone like Trump. 10:12: Rubio says he is trying to do to the American voter what he did to the Trump University students who were conned. Trump says the “real con artist” is Sen. Marco Rubio, who was elected in Florida and has the worst voting record in the United States Senate. Trump says the people of Florida can’t stand Rubio. He accuses Rubio of scamming and defrauding the people of Florida. Rubio says Trump has “cheated people out of their money” time and time again. 10:09: Kelly points out that Trump countersued the lead plaintiff and the court threw out the countersuit. She points out that the court found that victims of con artists sing the praises of their fleecers until they realize that they have been fleeced. Rubio says he spoke to one of the Trump University victims and he says Trump refused to give people their money back when they realized it was a scam and demand a refund. Trump claims he gave refunds to some people. [If Fox is fair, they would ask Rubio about his support for   colleges that also screwed people over  …    we’ll see if they do so.] 10:06: Rubio says there is a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever they want to hear  …     Rubio brings up Trump University and says people went into debt and have nothing in return for it after Trump said whatever he needed to get them to give him their   money. Trump says he doesn’t settle cases and that is why he doesn’t get sued often. Rubio accuses Trump of lying about Trump University’s ratings and whether people were satisfied. Kelly says the last public rating from the Better Business Bureau was a  . Trump insists that it was elevated to an A. 10:05: Kasich says people want to know whether they can believe it if someone tells them something. Kasich says people are upset because politicians tell them what they hear and they don’t deliver on these promises. [This is presenting Cruz a strong opportunity to say he kept his word to his constituents and that is why Washington hates him.] 10:00: At the top of the hour, Kelly says Trump has told voters one thing only to reverse himself right after. She has three examples ready. She has three videos ready on Trump’s   on Afghanistan, Syrian refugees, and whether Bush lied to get us into the Iraq War. Kelly says “there are many other examples” and how can he claim to be someone who “tells it like it is. ” Trump points out that one of the interviews was with Howard Stern —   Trump says he and Stern are great friends. And he points out Kelly’s friendship with Stern [Kelly said some racy things in an interview with Stern]. On Syrian refugees, Trump says we should be building safe zones in Syria. He said he he has changed his tune on things, especially Syrian refugees, the more he studies an issue. Kelly asks Trump voters are wondering what his core is  …     Trump says he hasn’t seen a successful person who didn’t have a certain degree of flexibility. He claims he has a “strong core. ” 9:55: Baier asks Trump about two or three potential national security advisers. Trump names Richard Haas, Col. Jack Jacobs. Kasich points out that a majority of voters in a survey said they trusted Kasich the most on foreign policy. He points out that he was there with Reagan when he was rebuilding the military. 9:49: Baier asks Trump about national security    neocons coming out against his candidacy. He asks Trump what he would do if the U. S. military refused to carry out his waterboarding orders. Trump says they won’t refuse. He says they are chopping off heads in the Middle East and “we’re talking about waterboarding. ” He says Cruz had a hard time with the waterboarding question and he thinks “if we want to go stronger,” we should. He says if someone flies into the World Trade Center and their family leaves to Saudi Arabia, he would have no problem targeting that family. Cruz says Americans understand that “yelling and cursing at people” doesn’t make someone a tough guy. Cruz says he will build the military like Reagan and destroy radical Islam like Reagan defeated the Soviets. Cruz says every militant will understand that they are signing their death warrant if they join ISIS. Re: Snowden, Cruz points out that he said in his initial statement that if Snowden violated the law, then he should be prosecuted. Cruz says now it is clear that Snowden committed treason and undermined the ability to defend the United States. 9:45: From Breitbart’s Joel Pollak: Trump Reassures Nation About Penis Size at GOP Debate, 9:43: Cruz says he will propose a   moratorium on the   visa program. Trump says people don’t want a   job so “we will bring people in and send people out. ” Trump says when we can, we hire people from Palm Beach. Trump says Americans don’t want very short,   jobs. Rubio says “that’s not accurate. ” He says there have been 300 Americans who applied and they were not  hired. Rubio says you have people captive when you bring in workers from abroad. Rubio is making a strong case —  but it rings hollow when his bill wanted to triple the number of   visas. Trump says he takes advantage of the law and there’s nothing wrong with it. Cruz then calls on Trump to have the New York Times release the tapes. 9:41: Trump shifts his position on   visas. [Has he even read his own plan?] He says he will change it because we need more brainpower in this country. He says he is softening his position on   visas. He says he is not playing to people’s fantasies on immigration and he is playing to the fact that our country is in trouble. 9:35: Kelly asks Rubio about Gang of Eight. Rubio says Trump should call on the New York Times to release the audio. Rubio says he wants to solve the issue and he did the best he could in the Senate controlled by Harry Reid. “We do need to deal with the issue,” he says. Rubio says illegal immigration will be brought under control. And he will move forward on immigration only after illegal immigration is under control. Kelly doesn’t ask Rubio a   about whether he supports a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and   tuition. [Like Wallace, Kelly asks Rubio a “tough” question, let’s him dodge, and does not follow up. That seems to be what Fox has planned  for Rubio.] 9:30: “Nice to be with you, Megyn,” Trump says. “You’re looking well. ” Kelly asks Trump about a BuzzFeed reported that claimed Trump expressed “flexibility” on immigration to the New York Times in an    interview. She wonders if Trump told the New York Times if he was flexible on deportation. Trump says BuzzFeed said he wouldn’t run for president and “boy, were they wrong. ” Trump says in terms of immigration, there always has to be some “tug and pull and deal. ” “I would never release    conversations,” Trump says. He adds that is not fair to anyone. And he says he is “not that flexible” on immigration. Trump says re: flexibility, he essentially says he will negotiate on the height of the wall but not on the wall itself. 9:29: Kelly essentially wonders if voters want Sessions’s policies on immigration, shouldn’t they support Trump since Sessions endorsed him. Cruz says that Trump supported Carter over Reagan and Kerry over George W. Bush. Trump says Trump funded Harry   and he funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight. Cruz says Trump has written checks to Clinton 10 times and wonders how he can stand up on a debate stage and say he wasn’t for Clinton  …     Trump says he supported Reagan and wrote checks to Clinton for his businesses. Trump says “the last person Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump. That I can tell you. ” 9:28: Kasich says balancing the budget is not a theory. And he is the only person who can say he was the architect behind balancing the budget. Very strong answer from Kasich, who inspired a lot of people to become Republicans in the 1990s with his floor speeches that were seen on CSPAN. Kasich says he is the one person running for president in either party who has restored the budget and cut taxes. 9:24: Wallace asks Cruz who will collect the taxes if he abolishes the IRS. Cruz says every American will fill out their taxes on a postcard and when we get rid of the corporate welfare, subsidies, and carveouts, it will simply the IRS. He says there will be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards. Cruz says that in between the insults between Rubio and Trump, the specificity was lacking. He says he has rolled out a plan to cut $500 billion in federal spending. Cruz says he understands Trump’s voters are angry at Washington and Cruz says for forty years, Trump has been a part of the corruption in Washington that they are angry about. He accuses Trump of using government for private gain. [This argument doesn’t work well and is too academic. But it doesn’t work when Trump’s voters think he will screw over the politicians just like he looked out for himself.   consultants do not understand this dynamic.] 9:21: Trump says he will get rid of the Department of Education, the EPA and get rid of waste, fraud and abuse that is “massive” throughout the federal government. Wallace claims Trump’s numbers do not add up  —   and Fox has graphics prepared to try to trip Trump up on his math. Trump says “we are going to buy things for less money” re: Medicare and “other things. ” Trump says we will properly negotiate to save the government money. 9:16: Wallace asks Rubio how many jobs he has created. Rubio claims Trump has inherited $100 million. Rubio says Trump can announce that the Donald J. Trump clothing will be made in the United States. Rubio says those in public service must allow the private sector to create jobs. But he hasn’t answered how many jobs he has created. Wallace asks Trump about his clothing collection but DOES NOT press Rubio about how many jobs he has created. “This little guy has lied so much about my record,” Trump says of Rubio. Trump uses the opportunity to blast TPP. Rubio says everything in his campaign store is made in America. Rubio says Trump engages in personal attacks because “he doesn’t have the answers. ” Trump says Rubio hasn’t employed one person while he has employed tens of thousands of people. When Trump calls Rubio “little Marco,” Rubio calls him “Big Donald. ” [What a comeback!] 9:12: Kasich says he can beat Clinton because he can get “crossover votes” and voters seem him as the “adult on the stage. ” He says he is working for President because he worked hard to fix this country as Chair of the Budget Committee in Congress. Baier presses Kasich on his path to the nomination, and Kasich all but concedes everyone’s path to the nomination is through a contested convention. Kasich says “it’s March Madness” and we’re heading up north “to my turf. ” Kasich says voters are wondering why he isn’t getting that much time on the debate stage. He has brought wage growth ad economic security to the country and he wants to do it again as president. He says the strength of our country is in our  . 9:08: Cruz says Americans are struggling and not interested in candidates bickering like school children. He says he will repeal every word of Obamacare and will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses and will abolish the IRS. [The only person who says something different at every debate is Trump. He keeps everyone interested and they tune in to hear his policy prescriptions on immigration, trade.] Trump says he has won 10 states while Cruz has only won two or three contests in response to Cruz’s claim that he is the only candidate who can beat Trump. “But he’s getting beaten very very badly,” Trump says. “So where is this coming from?” Rubio says that   of the people have voted against Trump. But way more voters have voted against Rubio. Rubio says Republicans don’t want to turn over Reagan’s GOP to someone who is not conservative. [Rubio doesn’t know how to deliver devastating attacks. As Newsweek’s Matt Cooper noted, he does seem like a hormonal teenager just firing off randomly.] Trump says a national poll found Rubio at 15 while Trump is at 49. Trump points out that means nearly 80% of Republicans are against Rubio. Trump says he is beating Clinton in many polls when Rubio claims that Trump cannot beat Clinton in a general election. 9:06: Baier asks Rubio about his personal attacks against Trump after vowing not to do so. Rubio says Trump has mocked everybody with personal attacks. And Trump deserved to be attacked that way. Rubio, who seems a bit anxious, says he would much rather have a debate on policy. He says the media have given Trump’s personal attacks “an incredible amount of coverage. ” Trump responds by saying that he called Rubio a “lightweight. ” Trump says Rubio is not that much of a lightweight. Trump says “he hit my hands. ” Trump says “I guarantee you there’s no problem” after remarking that Rubio implied that something else was small if Trump’s hands were small. 9:04: Trump “totally disavows” David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan. He says he has been doing so for two weeks. He says just take a look at his Twitter account. 9:02: As Wallace (not Kelly) asks Trump about Romney, the crowd boos (Romney). Trump says Romney was a “failed candidate” who “failed miserable” and was an “embarrassment to everybody. ” Trump says he “wants to be relevant” and “back in the game. ” Trump says he believes in free trade but if you look at China, Japan, Mexico and “every other country we do business with,” we “are getting absolutely crushed on trade. ” Trump says he has great people lined up re: trade and “we will make great trade deals. ” 9:00: Chris Wallace introduces the candidates. 8:45: Trump announced that Sen. Jeff Sessions will chair his National Security Advisory Committee. Trump said in a statement: “It is an honor to have Jeff as a member of the team. I have such great respect for him and I look forward to working with him on the issues most important to Americans. ” Sessions, whom Matt Drudge described as the conservative “soul” of the Senate, endorsed Trump last Sunday in Alabama. 7:04: Chris Matthews calls Romney a “certified loser” who is only attacking Trump because of his own ambition. 7:00: More calls for “unity. ” Billionaire Harold Hamm, who gave $1m to Romney in 2012, is latest megadonor to say he’d back Trump if he’s nominee https:  .   —   Rebecca Ballhaus (@rebeccaballhaus) March 3, 2016,  6:50: Brianna Keilar points out that Trump undermined the Clintons’s ability to play the “war on women” card.

If you recall, in the last debate, Trump was   by Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz over a lack of specifics. First, the plan emphasizes that ObamaCare will be fully repealed, including the mandate for everyone to have coverage, an issue that has sparked criticism against Trump. Trump’s main ideas for a replacement are to allow health insurance to be sold across state lines and permit people to make   contributions to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). HSAs are paired with a high deductible health insurance plan and are intended to make people more conscious of how they spend health dollars and reduce costs.   …     “These proposals, including repeal of the [Affordable Care Act] would lead to a significant increase in the number of people uninsured,” Larry Levitt, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which does nonpartisan healthcare analysis, wrote in an email. “In that sense, this plan really isn’t a replacement for the ACA.

       "        <td>Though the biggest controversy over the New Year’s Eve celebration at      Donald Trump’s Florida estate, was apparently whether or not Joe Scarborough could accurately be described as having “partied” there, video footage taken by a guest and obtained by CNN the next day brought renewed scrutiny to   Donald Trump’s own presence at the event. During a   speech given in front of the party’s   attendees, Trump praised his Emirati business partner Hussain Sajwani and Sajwani’s family, saying, “The most beautiful people from Dubai are here tonight, and they’re seeing it and they love it. ” CNN identifies Sajwani as a “billionaire developer in Dubai” who has “paid Trump millions of dollars to license the Trump name for golf courses in Dubai. ” Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, defended the remarks by clarifying that the   and Sajwani “had no formal meetings of professional discussions. Their interactions were social. ” Whether or not Hicks’s statement was true, Trump’s commendation of Sajwani is part of a pattern in which the   praises his business partners in ways that suggest he has little interest in extricating himself from his company’s interests. Previously, he has   business partners in Turkey and Argentina while on official calls with the countries’ leaders he also met, and took photos, with associates from India shortly after the election. Moreover, as with several of the countries in which   buildings are located, the United Arab Emirates has a questionable record on human rights Human Rights Watch specifically states that the nation “uses its affluence to mask the government’s   problems. ” By singling out Sajwani, Trump also runs headlong into accusations that he and his family are selling access to his administration through their organization and family foundations. According to Politico, tickets to celebrate with the   at    went for upwards of $500 the stated attendance of at least 800 people means that the Trump Organization made at least $400, 000 off of ticket sales for the event. (There is no indication that the party was a fundraiser for any outside organization, such as a charity or campaign fund, as is often the case when politicians attend such an event.) Whether or not the   sees it as such, the event offered attendees the opportunity to be in the same room as Trump and bend his ear for a price. This follows consternation regarding an auction for a    meeting with Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and a charity event that offered a reception with the   and a hunting trip with his two sons, both of which have since been cancelled, as well as ongoing speculation that foreign entities will attempt to curry favor with Trump by booking rooms and events at his hotel in Washington, D. C. That Trump singled out Sajwani at the New Year’s Eve party lends credence to these concerns —  it’s an instance of someone receiving the  ’s attention simply by buying a ticket to one of his events. The Background, Since his election, an   level of attention has been paid to the unprecedented conflicts of interest that   Donald J. Trump seems likely to bring with him when he assumes office. His responses to the concerns have been varied and, at times, contradictory. His first statement on the subject, which came via Twitter, suggested that he would make little effort to avoid entangling his business and his office, and would instead attack those who point that out: Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! A few days later, in a conference with the editorial staff of The New York Times, he appeared similarly defiant, asserting, “The law’s totally on my side, the president can’t have a conflict of interest. ” The  ’s public stance since the election has been inconsistent at best and contradictory at worst. In an   tweetstorm on November 30, Trump announced that he would be “holding a major news conference” on December 15 about a plan “being crafted which take[s] me completely out of business operations,” although he stressed again that he is “not mandated to do this under the law. ” As the date approached, his spokeswoman announced that he would be delaying the press conference until January. Soon after, Monica Langley of The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump Organization will not be selling off its global   holdings instead, Trump will be stepping down from his leadership role in his business empire and leaving it to his adult sons. However, as long as the   retains a financial stake in the company, the move does not mitigate his many conflicts of interest. As such, several Senate Democrats, led by Elizabeth Warren, have drafted legislation aimed at forcing Trump to divest or face impeachment. So far, the only indication that Trump may actually be distancing himself from his financial holdings is that, on December 6, Trump and his spokesman Jason Miller announced that Trump had sold off his stocks in June. However, neither provided any evidence of the sale, and considering the  ’s history of questionable or downright false statements regarding his finances —  see, for example, David Fahrenthold’s   exhaustive debunking of Trump’s claims regarding his charitable giving and namesake foundation —  the claim remains suspect. Until proof of the transaction has been established, such as by releasing broker records, this article will proceed based on his FEC filings, which remain the most recent documentation of his financial holdings. Central to the discussion is that, as Trump has repeatedly pointed out, the president and vice president are exempt from the Office of Government Ethics’ rules preventing conflicts of interest within the executive branch. More recently, attention has shifted to the Emoluments Clause, a relatively obscure section of the Constitution barring the chief executive from receiving gifts from foreign governments, which numerous experts say Trump might violate if his properties receive preferential treatment from other world leaders. However, case law on the clause’s possible application is sparse. At any rate, legality does not imply propriety. Unless Trump acts to put appropriate distance between himself and his business ventures, these questions are likely to continue throughout his time in the Oval Office. Below is an attempt to catalogue the more   examples of conflicts of interest that have emerged so far the most recent entries appear at the top. That Virginia Vineyard, Among the dozens of properties   Donald Trump owns is Trump Vineyard Estates and Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, the source of his namesake wine. Since Trump was elected, the property has requested temporary   visas for six foreign workers, according to The Washington Post. The visas, which are administered by the Citizenship and Immigration Services wing of the Department of Homeland Security, allow businesses to temporarily hire foreign, unskilled workers provided that the employer proves that there are not enough domestic candidates to fulfill a   or seasonal shortage and that the hiring will not depress wages for U. S.  employees. Trump, of course, will be in charge of appointing a new Secretary of Homeland Security once he assumes the presidency, which gives Trump authority over the very department responsible for deciding whether to grant the visas that the vineyard has requested. His current nominee, retired general John Kelly, has a relatively scant track record when it comes to immigration, leaving open the question of how much influence Trump himself will have over the DHS’s policy on the matter. On top of the fact that Trump will soon be able to influence the outcome of the request, that his organization has continued to request visas after his election underscores a tension in the  ’s stance on immigration. From the moment that he announced that he would be running for president, Trump made antagonism toward immigration the central aspect of his campaign, arguing that both legal and illegal immigrants are taking jobs that should be filled by   Americans and depressing wages for others. Though he did not specifically single out the   visa, the   has on multiple occasions spoken critically about the   program, which enables employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for skilled jobs like those in the tech industry. But the Trump Organization has long been a beneficiary of immigrant labor. For example, according to a Reuters report from August 2015, nine companies of which Trump is the majority owner have requested at least 1, 100 foreign visas since 2000. The majority of these requests were from Trump’s    Club in Florida, which has requested at least 787 foreign visas since 2006, including 70 applications in 2015. (Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that, since 2010, only 17 of the nearly 300 domestic applicants for positions at the    have been hired.) The Trump Organization also famously may have benefited from illegal immigration: There is significant evidence that many of the Polish construction workers at the Trump Tower construction site in New York in 1980 were in the country illegally. In other words, Trump’s track record includes not just taking advantage of the very visa process he claims to abhor but also actually subverting existing law for his own profit. Now, by applying for visas for his vineyard, Trump is signaling that he expects that his business will continue to be able to profit from one of the very immigration programs he continually denounces.  Back to table of contents, That Las Vegas Labor Dispute, On top of owning various properties and enterprises, Trump and his company employ roughly 34, 000 people, according to an analysis by CNN. On December 21, several hundred of those workers resolved  a labor dispute against the   —  one in which, had it continued for even a few weeks more, Trump would have had the unprecedented power to make appointments to affect its outcome. Here’s the situation: In October 2015, several hundred employees, primarily housekeeping staff, at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas voted to join the local branch of the Culinary Workers Union. Trump Ruffin Commercial LLC, which owns the hotel and is itself owned by Trump and the casino magnate Phil Ruffin, contested the vote, first by enlisting an   consulting firm (for whose services it paid $500, 000) and then by filing complaints with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Shortly before the election, the NLRB not only rejected Trump and Ruffin’s complaints but also found that, because the pair had refused to negotiate with the nascent union, they had violated federal law and their hotel was operating illegally. Trump and Ruffin have since appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On December 21, more than a year after the hotel’s workers first voted to join the union, the workers announced that they arrived at their first first   contract, achieved, according to an employee quoted in ThinkProgress, despite significant pressure from ownership that attempting to unionize would cost workers their jobs. According to the union, the new agreement “will provide the employees with annual wage increases, a pension, family health care, and job security” comparable to that of other Las Vegas hotels. Moreover, the Culinary Workers Union’s parent organization, UNITE HERE, has reached an agreement to represent workers at Trump’s   hotel in Washington, D. C.. Although this dispute has been resolved, it is included here because it exemplifies the type of situation in which Trump’s business interests are likely to overlap with his duties as president. Once he assumes office, Trump will be tasked with appointing members to fill current openings on the NLRB, the very body that ruled against him shortly before the election and will be tasked with resolving any future disputes between the hotel’s owners and its employees. Moreover, as Slate noted, the chief justice of the D. C. Court of Appeals is none other than Merrick Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court has spent months languishing in the   Congress and will likely be withdrawn once Trump becomes president. Finally, if disputes of this nature go beyond the Court of Appeals, the case would go to the Supreme Court, to which Trump will be appointing a justice once he assumes office, which is expected to tip the balance decisively in a more conservative (and likely  ) direction. In other words, no matter how far up the chain future disputes of this nature go, Trump’s presidency will give him new power to influence the results.  Back to table of contents, That Kuwaiti Event, According to an anonymous source and documents obtained by ThinkProgress, representatives from the Trump Organization pressured the ambassador of Kuwait to hold its embassy’s annual celebration of the country’s independence at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D. C. The event, held annually on February 25, was originally scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown the location was allegedly changed after members of the Trump Organization contacted the country’s ambassador. ThinkProgress’s source “described the decision as political,” suggesting that the embassy chose to relocate the event in an effort to curry favor with the  . The Kuwaiti ambassador has since disputed the report, telling The Washington Post that he had not been contacted by the Trump Organization and that the move “was solely done with the intention of providing our guests with a new venue. ” If ThinkProgress’s account is correct, Kuwait’s decision represents an escalation of a situation that has been developing since Trump’s election. The Trump International Hotel has been the subject of continual scrutiny for the conflict of interest it poses, in part because its lease explicitly bars elected officials from holding it, but mainly because Trump’s ownership of the hotel will almost definitely result in a violation of the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the president from receiving payments from foreign powers —  something that will arguably be happening any time a foreign government books a room at the hotel. Already, the hotel has begun advertising itself as a destination for diplomats and dignitaries, and the embassies of Azerbaijan and Bahrain have both scheduled events in the building. However, before the ThinkProgress report, there was no evidence that the Trump Organization had individually reached out to a foreign government in hopes of getting it to relocate an event to the hotel. Back to table of contents, Those Certificates of Divestiture, In addition to the many possibilities for   Trump to pursue his financial interests in office, the unique makeup of his cabinet also creates a new set of financial motivations. While Trump’s own fortune automatically makes his administration the wealthiest in history, he has also surrounded himself with an unprecedented collection of billionaires and   whose investments are likely to also come under scrutiny. Unlike the   himself, those who are up for Trump’s cabinet, such as his proposed Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, will be legally obligated to divest from any holdings which may pose a conflict of interest. However, as The Washington Post noted, even selling off their holdings offers an opportunity for Trump’s cabinet members to enhance their fortunes. A federal program known as a “certificate of divestiture” allows   appointees and employees to avoid   taxes when selling their assets. The program has existed since 1989, and most recently received attention when President George W. Bush appointed Hank Paulson, then the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as his Treasury Secretary in 2006. Paulson was forced to sell off $700 million in shares of the bank the certificate of divestiture enabled him to avoid a potential $200 million in   tax liability. According to The Washington Post, the Office of Government Ethics is currently researching whether the   himself would qualify for the tax break even if he doesn’t, the unprecedented wealth of Trump’s cabinet promises to push this provision, and the financial incentives it creates, to the limit. Back to table of contents, That Carrier Deal, One of   Donald Trump’s first major economic moves as   was the deal that he and Vice   Mike Pence struck with the   manufacturer Carrier, which had planned to move 2, 100 jobs from its Indiana plant to Mexico. Finalized on November 29, the compromise kept 730 of the plant’s jobs in Indiana in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks over 10 years. The deal immediately attracted praise and criticism on both sides of the aisle, with much of the scrutiny going toward the tradeoff between jobs and tax breaks and Trump’s idiosyncratic,   negotiation techniques. An additional detail soon emerged regarding the deal: According to his FEC filings (which, despite Trump and his spokesman Jason Miller’s unverified statements that the   sold off his stock in June, remain the most recent public record of the  ’s finances) Trump holds stock in Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies. In 2014, his investment in the company was between $100, 001 and $250, 000, while in 2015, the stock is listed as worth less than $1, 001, which could indicate that he sold some or most of the stock each year, his holdings earned him between $2, 500 and $5, 000. The paucity of information in the FEC filings makes it difficult to ascertain why his holdings appear to have decreased regardless, the investment is not only one of several hundred but also a relatively minor one among Trump’s many holdings, some of which are worth over $5, 000, 000. As a result, it’s difficult to know how much, if at all, Trump may have considered the stock, particularly considering that he didn’t appear to remember his initial promise to save the Carrier plant. Additionally, Trump does not have stock in the next company he called out on Twitter, Rexnord Corporation (which is also based in Indiana) or its parent company, The Carlyle Group. Still, Trump’s deal with Carrier demonstrates the unprecedented challenge the  ’s conflicts of interest create: Unless he either puts his holdings in a truly blind trust or divests completely, a significant number of the decisions he makes will involve some level of financial incentive for himself as well as for the country. Back to table of contents, That   Issue, Over the past few months, a number of experts have called for   Donald Trump to either sell off his business holdings or, if the illiquidity of his assets prevents him from doing so, to put as much as possible into a blind trust managed by a lawyer or other trustee with whom he will have no contact. Pursuing one of these two options is seen by many as an important step to distancing himself from even the appearance that he will be considering his own financial prospects in addition to those of the nation while in office. In response, Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he intends to cede control of his business to his three adult children, Donald Jr. Ivanka, and Eric, although, as has been previously noted, doing so would barely even create the appearance of a blind trust given how his children are close advisers, members of his transition team, and, well, his children. (Trump has also alluded on Twitter to an upcoming press conference in which he intends to more fully explain his plans, although doubts remain that the arrangement he proposes will actually create the necessary barriers between Trump and his business.) Moreover, even if one does take take the   at his word that his children will be entirely separate from his administration, events since his election strongly suggest otherwise. All three have been seen in contexts that significantly diminish the appearance of separation Roughly two weeks before the election, Donald Jr. met with a   group in Paris to discuss his father’s policy toward Syria and, according to Politico, was involved in his father’s search for a Secretary of the Interior he was also spotted hunting in Turkey shortly after his father’s phone call with Turkish President Recep Erdogan in which the   praised a Turkish business partner. Eric, meanwhile, appeared in photos with his father and a group of Indian businessmen mere days after the election. Officials within the State Department have begun to express frustration with the optics of the Trump family’s current system. Much of the focus, though, has been on Ivanka, whom many consider to be among her father’s most trusted advisers, and the various ways she has indicated that she will remain a part of both the family business and her father’s administration. Ivanka also appeared in the photos with the family’s Indian business partners, and she and her husband Jared Kushner —  also one of Trump’s advisers —  sat in on a meeting between the   and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reports later emerged that, at the time, Ivanka was in negotiation with the Japanese apparel company Sanei International, whose parent company is owned in large part by the Japanese government. A number of outlets have reported that, while Melania Trump will be the official First Lady, Ivanka plans to assume a policy portfolio akin to that of previous first ladies one issue she apparently plans to take on is climate change, on which she recently met with her father and former Vice President Al Gore. Even the optics of physical distance are diminishing: According to CNN, Ivanka and Jared plan to move from New York to Washington, D. C. once the Trump administration begins. That the  ’s children appear involved in both the Trump administration and the Trump Organization presents a major threat to the   norm that presidents should distance themselves from business interests that could interfere with their official duties. Finally, removing himself from    operations will do little to change the fact that Trump will retain substantive knowledge of the illiquid assets involved in his business, such as the numerous buildings and other products that bear his name, especially if he remains in frequent contact with his children. Even assuming that Trump does separate himself from any consideration of his holdings, his children will still likely be major players in the family’s organization, which will still bear at least the Trump name —  arguably one of their most valuable properties, as much of the family’s wealth derives from licensing the name to   companies. Given the family’s     (Ivanka, for example, briefly appeared to be distancing herself from the campaign, and several properties considered rebranding under the name “Scion” when it appeared Trump would lose) the situation epitomizes the way Trump’s, and his family’s, business interests may very well prove inextricable from his actions as president. Back to table of contents, Those Fannie and Freddie Investments, After railing against elites during the campaign, Trump has so far stocked his prospective cabinet with an array of billionaires whose policy positions seem likely to significantly benefit those who are also doing very well. Trump’s putative treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is no exception: His resume includes stints as a banker at Goldman Sachs, a Hollywood producer, and the operator of a bank that has been described as a “foreclosure machine” and once foreclosed on a homeowner over a   discrepancy. One of Mnuchin’s apparent beliefs is that the government should cede control of the mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government acquired during the 2008 financial crisis. The two financial institutions’ stocks rose by more than 40 percent after Mnuchin stated that he believes the Trump administration “will get it done reasonably fast. ” Doing so would be broadly compatible with Trump’s general antipathy toward regulation of the banking industry. However, The Wall Street Journal identified an additional wrinkle to the story: When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s stocks rose, one major beneficiary was John Paulson, an adviser to the Trump campaign and a business partner of Mnuchin’s. Paulson’s hedge funds include significant investments in both Fannie and Freddie. Trump himself has invested between $3 million and $5 million across three of Paulson’s funds, according to his filings with the Federal Election Commission (which remain the only available window into the  ’s financial holdings). In other words, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s stock prices increase —  and they have so far more than doubled since the election on the expectation that the incoming Trump administration will be more lenient toward the financial sector than Obama —  Trump’s portfolio benefits. Back to table of contents, That Phone Call With Taiwan, When news first emerged that the   spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   on December 2, the immediate reaction was uproar over his apparently impetuous breach of decades of U. S. protocol toward China and Taiwan. As my colleague David Graham explained, since 1979, the United States has participated in the “artful diplomatic fiction” of officially recognizing the mainland People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate Chinese government while maintaining loose, unofficial recognition of —  and significant economic and military ties to —  Taiwan. That Trump would speak to the president of Taiwan, especially before doing the same with Xi Jinping, the president of the PRC, flies in the face of a diplomatic tradition that has undergirded almost 40 years of U. S.  relations. Amid the days of dissembling that followed the phone call, an additional worrisome detail came out: The Trump Organization has apparently been exploring expansion into Taiwan. Soon afterwards, the Trump Organization denied that it planned to do so however, even before the controversy arose, the mayor of Taoyuan, Taiwan, the municipality in which the Trump Organization allegedly wants to build, described in a televised interview a meeting with a representative of the Trump Organization in September to discuss prospective   projects, and at least one Trump employee was found to have posted on Facebook that she was in Taiwan at the time on a business trip. The phone call, and the many statements that have followed, are of particular interest because of the extent to which they dovetail with some of the biggest concerns about Trump’s approach toward governance. In the ensuing 48 hours, Republican officials offered several, sometimes entirely contradictory, explanations of what initially appeared to be an impulsive move by Trump depending on who was speaking, the phone call was actually initiated by   (which, if technically true, ignores that it was Trump’s staff who arranged the conversation) was just “a courtesy,” or manifested a policy shift weeks in the making —  although, regardless, it was made without first consulting the White House or State Department. The defense of the move, and the questions it creates regarding conflicts of interest, have largely hinged on the belief that, since voters apparently don’t mind, the reaction was overblown. On this issue, though, whether or not voters care is immaterial to the central question. The   of the United States breached decades of international protocol created to preserve a precarious balance of power. That decision raised not only the possibility that Trump was blundering into a potential international incident but also that he may have done so in part out of consideration for his business prospects. Back to table of contents, That Deutsche Bank Debt, Though he often brags about leveraging   law to become “The King of Debt,” Trump’s numerous bankruptcy filings have left most large Wall Street banks reticent to lend to him, according to The Wall Street Journal. Among the few exceptions is Deutsche Bank, which “has led or participated in loans of at least $2. 5 billion” to the   since 1996, with at least another $1 billion in loan commitments to   companies more than $300 million of those loans have come since 2012. The  ’s indebtedness does not itself pose a conflict of interest, but Deutsche Bank’s ongoing legal troubles very well might. The Justice Department is currently negotiating with Deutsche Bank regarding a preliminary settlement of $14 billion to resolve probes into allegedly misleading predatory lending practices in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis while it is believed that Deutsche Bank will push back against the sum, there has been no public news regarding negotiations since the initial figure was reported in September. Trump will soon be naming many of the officials with jurisdiction over this and other deals, prompting several House Democrats to send a letter to federal financial agencies calling for close scrutiny of how Trump may seek to influence the settlement through his appointments —  although doing so would be just as in keeping with his general stance toward financial regulation as with active protection of his pocketbook. Other Democrats have called for the proactive appointment of independent prosecutors to avoid any appearance of conflict if the case is not resolved before Trump takes office. Fears that Trump may unduly consider his indebtedness to Deutsche Bank in deciding his administration’s policy toward the financial sector go beyond general anxiety about deregulation. Deutsche Bank is undergoing a period of struggle that may have it on the verge of failure already. Its stock valuation has dropped by more than half since July 2015 in January, it posted its first   loss since 2008 and one of its many tranches of bonds —  one specifically designed to be a     safety valve in times of trouble —  has recently begun to crash. In June, the International Monetary Fund called Deutsche Bank “the most important net contributor to systemic risks” among globally important financial institutions. If the bank were to fail, it could have major consequences for not only Trump’s businesses, which would lose their sole remaining lender, but for the global economy as well. Arguably, the $14 billion fine the Justice Department is seeking to impose has exacerbated rather than alleviated these struggles. Based the company’s market capitalization —  the number of shares multiplied by their price —   of roughly $16 billion, the sum would leave Deutsche Bank critically low in liquid assets with which to absorb future troubles. although the institution’s own   of $68 billion argues otherwise. But given the complexity and potential volatility of the situation, it is important for any decision to be free from outside influence, something Trump’s outstanding debt threatens to jeopardize. Back to table of contents, That Secret Service Detail, During the election, the Trump campaign put no small portion of its funds toward paying for use of the candidate’s own properties perhaps the most notable of these expenditures was the nearly $170, 000 the campaign spent in July on rent for its headquarters in Trump Tower. These expenses raised the possibility that, as Trump predicted in 2000, he “could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it. ” Now that he will be president, he may be able to profit off of the Secret Service by virtue of the fact that he and his family will live in Trump Tower and fly in his private jets —  which requires the agents tasked with guarding them to pay him rent and airfare. The first way Trump could monetize his own protective detail is by having family members travel in his two planes and three helicopters. This is not so much speculative as foregone: Over the course of the campaign, the Secret Service, which traditionally pays for its own travel during elections, spent $2. 74 million to fly on a plane owned by one of Trump’s own companies. Once Trump takes office, he will fly exclusively on Air Force One, while Mike Pence will be riding Air Force Two. However, their families may still be flying on Trump’s private planes —  along with their protective details, which would effectively direct even more money to Trump. (Previous first families have flown with a detail, whose legal purview covers “the immediate family members,” but none have done so on planes they themselves own.) A bigger question regards Trump Tower in New York, where the   appears likely to spend a significant amount of time. For the past few decades, it has been common practice for the Secret Service to provide protection for the president and vice president’s   House residences, which sometimes entails paying rent to the officeholder. (Joe Biden, for example, received $2, 200 per month when the agency rented a cottage he owned near his home in Delaware.) But Trump Tower is a unique case, as it’s not in Delaware but the middle of Manhattan. Already, pedestrians and tourists are chafing at the increased security around the building, Trump’s frequent use of which has required closing a block of 56th Street and multiple lanes of Fifth Avenue with multiple outlets reporting that Trump’s wife Melania and    son Barron are expected to stay at Trump Tower for at least part of his term, it appears that the consternation will continue, with an enormous price tag for taxpayers: According to the New York Post, it could cost as much as $3 million a year to rent out two of the building’s vacant floors, meaning that Trump will be making money off of his own security detail. Meanwhile, Reuters has reported that the city of New York is calling for federal funds to reimburse the costs of keeping up a security detail around Trump Tower. This system creates an unusual set of conflicting interests for Trump regarding his own travel and residences. Though presidents as disparate as Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama have evoked partisan ire over time spent away from the White House, whether on the golf course or on vacation in Hawaii, only Donald Trump will actually have gained from his and his family’s travels. And if, while in office, Trump visits properties he owns other than Trump Tower —  his buildings in other U. S. cities like Chicago and Miami, for example, or his golf course and resort in Scotland, or one of the many international hotels bearing his name —  he stands to gain from the stays for which his security detail (and, by extension, taxpayers) may be paying. Moreover, the more his family members fly on his planes, whether they are running his business on his behalf or running interference with foreign leaders, the more the Secret Service will end up paying for seats alongside them. In fact, there are already signs that the Trump Organization has no qualms about making money off of the New York tower’s new security arrangements in more ways than one. According to Politico, just five days after the election, a prominent New York   firm invoked Trump Tower’s new   detail as a selling point for a $2. 1 million condominium, which it described as “The Best Value in the Most Secure Building in Manhattan. ” Though the flier was issued by an outside agency, the  ’s corporation still stands to benefit from increased traffic through processing and other service fees, making the advertisement a clear example of how Trump stands to benefit off of his new position. Back to table of contents, That Property in Georgia (the Country) Trump’s election has had the effect of speeding up development on a number of his branded properties, even when the   appears not to be pulling any strings himself. As occurred with Trump Tower Buenos Aires, the completion of an embattled   building in the former Soviet republic of Georgia is no longer on hold now that Trump has won. The project, which has been in the works in the seaside resort city of Batumi since 2010, was initially scheduled to break ground in 2013, but has been in stasis for several reasons, possibly including the 2013 electoral defeat of President Mikheil Saakashvili, a friend of Trump’s and a supporter of the deal. According to a report in The Washington Post, the   of the Trump property in Batumi has not been linked to a specific conversation with Georgian leaders, and a U. S.  partner on the project has suggested that it has moved forward without any nudging from the government. However, numerous public statements in the days since suggest that Trump’s election was a major factor, including an interview with a   entrepreneur who said, “Cutting the ribbon on a new Trump Tower in Georgia will be a symbol of victory for all of the free world. ” That the property seems to be moving forward solely because Trump was elected suggests his various business interests around the world may play a role not only in his foreign policy but in how other countries seek to deal with the U. S. as well. America’s relationship with Georgia is largely shaped by concerns about Russian influence and potential aggression in the region, most recently manifested in Russia’s 2008 seizure of two regions of Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. With controversy already swirling over Trump’s admiration for Putin and Russia’s alleged role in the U. S. election, some in the   community have expressed trepidation that Trump’s potential deferential attitude toward Russia would prove deleterious for the continued independence of former satellite nations like Georgia. So, if Georgia has an ulterior motive behind the approval of Trump’s property in Batumi, it would be to keep Russia at bay and maintain the status quo in the region. It’s alarming that a country like Georgia may be giving Trump’s businesses favorable treatment (whether he asked for it or not) in an attempt to influence his foreign policy. Back to table of contents, That Phone Call With Erdogan, One of the worries regarding Trump’s many conflicts of interest is that they may influence policy towards countries whose relationships with the U. S. are currently strained. Such is the case with Turkey, whose president, Recep Erdogan, has been cracking down significantly on civil liberties and democratic institutions within the country after a failed coup last summer. Though Turkey has in the past been a vital U. S. ally as a bulwark against Islamic terror, Erdogan’s authoritarian turn and combative stance toward Europe have led to some reevaluation of that relationship. Thus, it was troubling news that when Erdogan phoned Trump earlier this month —  it was one of the first calls Trump received after his victory —  Trump used the opportunity to plug his business partners in Istanbul. According to the Huffington Post, while on the line with Erdogan, Trump relayed praise for the leader from Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, whose    Aydin Dogan, owns the holding company that operates the Trump Towers in Istanbul. Dogan has previously drawn Erdogan’s ire by criticizing the leader in recent years, however, Dogan’s companies, most notably CNN Turk, have shown support for Erdogan’s regime, including broadcasting his first message after the uprising in July. Trump’s conversation with Erdogan is also worth noting because of a number of Trump’s previous statements regarding the Turkish president. Though Erdogan briefly called for Trump’s name to be removed from the Istanbul property due to his proposed ban on Muslim immigration, Erdogan dropped the demand when, after the overthrow attempt, Trump praised Erdogan for “turning it around” and essentially dismissed concerns over Erdogan’s crackdown on civil liberties by bringing up domestic problems. Michael Flynn, who was recently named Trump’s national security adviser, wrote an     in The Hill arguing against offering asylum to a Muslim cleric whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating the uprising, which some have interpreted as a diplomatic overture. Erdogan has also bristled at   protests in the U. S. and the description of both himself and Trump as part of a “ring of autocrats. ” That the two are now talking about their countries’ relationship as in the same conversation as Trump’s business interests further complicates Trump’s strangely effusive comments about Erdogan. It’s worth noting that Trump himself considers his hotel in Istanbul a potential conflict of interest. In a December 2015 interview with Stephen Bannon, at the time the chairman of Breitbart News, Trump said as much, telling Bannon, “I have a little conflict of interest ‘cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul. It’s a tremendously successful job.” That he chose to discuss the towers with Erdogan, albeit obliquely, through his references to his business partners when he has already acknowledged the impropriety of doing so simply reinforces the perception that he may prove unable to separate his business from his official duties once he assumes office. Back to table of contents,  That Hotel in Washington, D. C. The White House is not the only new Trump property in Washington, D. C. there’s also the new Trump International Hotel, which opened in October and is located just a few blocks away in what was formerly known as the Old Post Office Pavilion. Previously, the hotel played a role in the campaign as the site of the event at which Trump recanted (sort of) his belief that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Now, the hotel is at the center of speculation as a symbol of how inextricable Trump’s presidential role may be from his personal interests. First and foremost, Trump does not own the location outright instead, he leases the building from the federal government’s General Services Administration, an agency whose next administrator Trump will soon be appointing. The GSA has explicit regulations prohibiting contracts with government employees to prevent conflicts “that might arise between the employees’ interests and their Government duties, and to avoid the appearance of favoritism or preferential treatment. ” The Trump Organization’s   lease on the property likewise states, “no . .. elected official of the Government of the United States . .. shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom. ” According to House Democrats, the GSA has ruled that Trump “will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office” and must divest from the property before he does so. As if its location didn’t pose enough of an ethical question, the hotel has already hosted at least one promotional event specifically aimed at enticing foreign diplomats to stay at the establishment while in town on official state business. On the one hand, direct influence will likely be difficult to prove: The establishment is, after all, a   hotel that would have been likely to attract   clientele even if Trump had lost the election, a fact to which Trump and those who surround him may well point in order to maintain a patina of respectability around their dealings. Still, the meeting’s proximity to the election reinforces that it will be worth watching the comings and goings at the hotel closely for signs that Trump, who so often accused his opponent (often without evidence) of    may be using his position as president to promote his businesses. Trump himself acknowledged that his presidency is likely to increase traffic to his Washington, D. C. property. Speaking to The New York Times, the   noted that the property is “probably a more valuable asset than it was before” and that his brand is “hotter” since the election. However, he went on to insist that there was nothing even potentially problematic about his unprecedented situation and that he sees no reason why he couldn’t run both the presidency and his business without conflict. Multiple events since the election have made Trump’s lease on the hotel a central focus of discussions of his conflicts of interest, including among Democrats in the House. On November 29, Bahrain —  a country whose donations to the Clinton Foundation Trump and his campaign decried during the campaign —  announced that it would be celebrating the anniversary of its king’s ascension to the throne at the hotel. Other events announced since the election include a Hannukah celebration   by the Embassy of Azerbaijan and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and a reception for the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation featuring Vice   Mike Pence as its keynote speaker. Numerous ethics experts, many of whom are calling for Trump to generally divest his business holdings, have singled out the building’s lease, which will likely be breached the moment Trump takes office even if he does transfer his company to his children. And on November 30, mere hours after Trump stated on Twitter that “legal documents are being crafted which take [him] completely out of business operations,” Buzzfeed reported that Trump and the federal government were closing in on a tax subsidy for the property that could be worth as much as $32 million. As a result of the increasing scrutiny, the hotel and his handling of the commotion about it have become emblematic of the broader issues surrounding Trump’s conflicts of interest. Back to table of contents, That Argentinian Office Building, According to a report by the prominent Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata, the  ’s first phone call with his Argentine counterpart Mauricio Macri included a discussion of the permit issues currently holding up construction of a new   office building in Buenos Aires. Both Macri and Trump quickly denied the report according to a statement from the Embassy of Argentina, “The subject both leaders talked about was the institutional relationship, and they briefly mentioned the personal relationship they have had for years. ” As summarized in a tweetstorm here, Trump’s relationship with Argentina’s government and business elites —  and the story so far on his property there —  is already long and convoluted. The phone call with Macri was apparently set up through Felipe Yaryura, one of Trump’s longtime associates whose company, YY Development Group, is in charge of Trump Tower Buenos Aires. The day after the phone call, the PanAm Post reported that YY Development Group had been approved to break ground in June 2017 evidence has since emerged that the permitting process is not, in fact, finished, although Trump’s business associates are moving ahead as though it is. Back to table of contents, Those Companies in Saudi Arabia, Even as Trump was running for president, his company was continuing to operate and open new properties. While the most memorable openings may have been that of his hotel in Washington, D. C. and his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, the Trump Organization was continuing to work on projects in other countries, including, according to a report the Washington Post, registering eight new companies in Saudi Arabia during the   campaign. The organization’s endeavors in Saudi Arabia are notable not only because they may further complicate the shaky relationship between the U. S. and an   gulf state notorious for   abuses but also because of how they relate to Trump’s campaign rhetoric. One of his criticisms of Hillary Clinton was that her charitable foundation had accepted donations from governments with questionable records on human rights, most notably Qatar and Saudi Arabia, always with the implication (or direct accusation) that they were doing so to curry favor with Clinton when she was secretary of state. That Trump was continuing to level this criticism while his namesake organization was actively pursuing new projects in Saudi Arabia not only bodes ill for his ability to separate his personal and presidential interests but also further calls into question the honesty and transparency of his campaign. Back to table of contents, That British Wind Farm, As he indicated when he stopped there during the campaign,   Trump takes enormous pride in his recently opened golf course in Turnberry, Scotland. The day after the British public voted for Brexit —  over intense Scottish opposition —  Trump spoke at the property’s opening, proudly touting how the decision’s deflationary effect on the pound would benefit his business. Now, it appears that Trump has taken active steps to intercede at Turnberry in the interest of his own pocketbook. According to The New York Times, Trump had a   meeting with Nigel Farage in which he “encouraged Mr. Farage and his entourage to oppose the kind of offshore wind farms that Mr. Trump believes will mar the pristine view from one of his two Scottish golf courses. ” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the   denied that the two had discussed the subject, only for Trump to later confirm that the topic had, in fact, come up in their conversation. Back to table of contents, Those Indian Business Partners, It didn’t take long after the election for   Trump to be seen in public with international business partners. According to a November 19 article in The New York Times, Trump took a break from his transition schedule to meet with three Indian   executives who are currently building a   apartment complex in Mumbai. According to both Trump and the Indian businessmen, the meeting was essentially congratulatory in nature a picture posted by one of the executives on Twitter shows the four men smiling broadly and giving a   to the camera. However, that the meeting happened in the first place suggests that Trump does not currently have any qualms about forestalling official state business for personal business. On top of that, the meeting raises questions in the   realm as well. The   himself was not the only member of his family there two Facebook photos show that Ivanka and Eric Trump both attended the meeting as well. Their presence serves as a reminder that their father seems so far uninterested in maintaining even the nominal separation between himself and his assets that he repeatedly said he would create during the campaign. Back to table of contents, That Envoy From the Philippines, One leader with whom Trump already has an advantage over President Obama is Rodrigo Duterte, the similarly brash president of the Philippines. Duterte, who has threatened to “break up with America,” told Obama to “go to hell,” and called the president a “son of a whore,” expressed admiration for Trump, noting that, among other similarities, they both enjoy swearing. Duterte’s affinity for Trump apparently goes beyond vulgar word choice. Late in October, Duterte appointed a longtime business associate of Trump’s as a special envoy to the United States, an announcement that became public shortly after the election. This appointment in particular raises questions because it is just as open to exploitation by Duterte as it is to Trump, as the Filipino president could intend to use his new envoy’s relationship with Trump to strengthen the Philippines’ hand. Whichever side the appointment does eventually benefit, however, the situation is nevertheless fraught with conflicts between the three men’s personal and political interests.

Period. The end.”  —   Chris Moody (@moody) March 2, 2016,  11:49: Tavis Smiley: Hillary Shouldn’t Take Black Voters for Granted Against Trump, Something tells me that if Donald Trump is indeed the Republican nominee, it might be a miscalculation for Democrats to assume that black voters are a lock for their nominee, even with the first black president and Barack Obama both campaigning for her. [Tony Lee: Van Jones, Jamelle Bouie and others have said that black voters may be receptive to Trump’s message. So there’s something there. It’s amusing that the same media and GOP establishment pundits who said Trump could not win the GOP nomination because he initially had such unfavorable poll numbers with Republican voters are now saying that he will lose minority voters by a landslide in a  potential general election. Not so fast. First, minority voters may not want to publicly admit that they support Trump because they fear a backlash against them, stirred by “leaders” and “activists” who often care more about their bottom lines and standing in the political circles than the interests of their communities. Second, though Clinton connects better with minority voters than Sanders, that’s not really saying much. Just compare Obama’s Brown Chapel AME address in 2007 with Hillary Clinton’s at a Selma church on the same day. Or compare Obama’s “fierce urgency of now” speech at Iowa’s   dinner with whatever   speech Clinton gave. Third, mainstream media members and GOP establishment pundits surround themselves with minorities who speak “Politically Correct English. ” They went to the same schools. Are from the same zip codes. Roll in the same social circles. But there are a lot of politically incorrect and   minorities who are not ashamed to watch and enjoy WWE rasslin’ who may find Trump’s message as respective as   union workers. When the media ask Trump about his current    favorability ratings with minorities, he should point out that campaigns are run to change perceptions. And Trump’s GOP presidential campaign has already changed the perception of Republican voters who viewed him so unfavorably when he entered the race.] 11:43: Newt on Trump’s presser: Trump’s decision to hold a serious press conference instead of a campaign speech was masterful and a great contrast to Cruz and Rubio.  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) March 2, 2016,  11:37: MN GOP caucus winners over the years: MN GOP caucus winners:2016  —   Rubio2012  —   Santorum2008  —   Romney, Strong record of choosing winners! https:  .   —   Andrew Good (@Drewbueno) March 2, 2016,  11:35: Rubio having a tough time spinning the press: No joke.

Democrats simply aren’t being energized by Hillary Clinton’s calculated campaign to maintain the status quo or Bernie Sanders’ fringe calls for a socialist ‘revolution,’” RNC Chair Priebus says in a statement. “The Democrat Primary has become a race to the far left between an embattled frontrunner facing an FBI investigation and a   socialist who continues to win states and outraise the Clinton machine. At the end of the day, Democrats are saddled with two fundamentally flawed candidates destined to fail in a general election and a message that isn’t resonating or in line with the majority of Americans. ” WOW.

Cruz says Trump funded the “Gang of Eight” while he led the successful opposition to the Gang of Eight’s amnesty plan. He rips Trump for supporting Planned Parenthood while he will direct the Justice Dept. to investigate Planned Parenthood. He says, unlike Trump, he will never compromise away our religious liberties and or Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. Cruz says he will rip away the catastrophic Iran nuclear deal. Cruz says he understands those who are “angry with Washington” and accuses Trump of being part of the Washington corruption for 40 years. Cruz calls on Trump to release the NY Times    interview about immigration. He says voters have a right to know if he is lying to the voters about immigration. [Tony Lee: Trump’s press conference made him look different tonight. He stood out as a   and did not sound like one with his unconventional press conference. Cruz and Clinton sound like typical   when their speeches are compared to Trump’s press conference. Which candidate tonight spoke the language of the voters?] 10:19: Cruz says Republicans in the next primary states have a choice to make. He says America shouldn’t have a president whose words would embarrass them. He says our president should make us proud and inspire hope in all of us. “We can nominate a Washington dealmaker —  profane and vulgar —  who has a lifelong power of using government power for personal gain,” Cruz says. “Or we can nominate a proven conservative who has fought consistently for working men and women and to defend the Constitution. ” 10:17: Cruz says “tonight, this campaign enters a new phase. ” Cruz says a Trump nomination would be a disaster for Republicans. He says his campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, can beat, and will beat Donald Trump. Cruz proudly says he has beaten Trump three times. [But if a baseball teams plays five   sets against an opponent and loses 12 of them, is that something to brag about?] 10:15: “God Bless the Lone Star state,” Cruz says. “And God Bless the great state of Oklahoma. ” Senator Cruz victory party is at the redneck Country Club in Stafford.

It could have cost him Virginia and prevented him from meeting the 20% threshold in various states.

Way to go!] 10:06: Reporter mischaracterizes Trump’s “negotiable” comments. Trump says if he wants a   wall, he will negotiate it down to 48 feet to appease more people. When asked about establishment Republicans trying to throw monkey wrenches into the delegate selection process, Trump says he has “millions and millions of people” who are providing tremendous energy for Republicans. Trump says it would be undemocratic if GOP   (and desperate professional pundits who so desperately want to be “influencers” on the right) try to steal the nomination from him at the convention. Trump says “nobody is going to beat us” after GOP is unified. 10:02: Trump says he always liked Marco before he decided to go “hostile” and become a   Don Rickles. Trump says Rubio’s “ ” attacks hurt him. “He had a bad night,” Trump said, according to CNN, Fox. Trump says at least you can say that “Ted has won something. ” Trump says “our infrastructure” is going to hell after he says that Paul Ryan will “pay a price” if he doesn’t get along with him. Trump says even the media will be proud of him as president. He says “Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a clue” about rebuilding the country. Trump says Clinton’s record as Secretary of State was “abysmal. ” Trump says what Clinton did was a “criminal act” and if she is allowed to run, “it will be a sad day for this country” because “what she did was wrong. And other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price. ” Worth nothing Clinton had not held a press conference for nearly 90 days: Clinton talks Super Tuesday, Trump and what happens if Sanders has a bad night in first gaggle in 88 days. https:  .   —   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) March 1, 2016,  10:01: Trump says he will do great with   Hispanics and every other group because he will bring jobs back. 9:59: Trump says radical Islamic terrorism is a “big, big problem” and we need to “figure it out. ” Trump says Muslim migrants are “young” and “strong” and “powerful” and we have “no idea who they are. ” Trump says he has a heart so we will build a safe zone in Syria. He says he will loosen up the wallets of the Gulf States so they can pay for the safe zone. 9:56: “We are going to have a wall,” Trump says. Trump says he has thousands of Hispanic workers. Trump says the Mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders. Trump says Fox used the “ultimate word” because he was angry that someone dared to say that Mexico will pay for the wall. Trump says “100%. Mexico is going to pay. ” Trump talks about the country’s heroin problem and he says he’s going to “stop it” because “we’re going to have a strong border. ” He says people are going to come in and they are going to come in legally. 9:55: Trump says he’ll make deals as president that are good for the American people. He blasts Obama for using executive actions. Then he pivots to corporate inversion and says Obama doesn’t know how to make deals to bring money back to the United States. 9:49: Trump says he is “doing what’s right” when asked if he is moving to the center for the general election. He again praises Planned Parenthood for helping millions but says it should not receive taxpayer funding so long as it performs abortion. He says he is going to be “really good for women” and for “women’s health issues. ” Trump says he is more conservative than anybody on the military, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of Obamacare, and getting rid of Common Core. Trump says he is a  . Trump says he feels “awfully good” when asked if he feels like the “presumptive nominee. ” Trump says he is watching the CNN people, the MSNBC people, and the Fox people.

His campaign should say that is another way that differentiates him from Clinton, who went nearly 90 days without facing the press. 9:44: Trump says we can’t keep losing manufacturing jobs. Trump says we have “tremendous power” over everybody but we have politicians ” that truly, truly truly don’t know what they’re doing. ” Trump says he is “honored” by this evening’s results. 9:43: Stunning map of Trump’s “across the board” support: No Republican nominee has ever won all of the different states Donald Trump has https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) March 2, 2016,  9:40: Trump says this has been an “amazing evening. ” Trump congratulates Cruz for winning Texas for an “excellent win. ” Trump says he watched Clinton’s speech and says Clinton has been there for so long and if she hasn’t straightened it out, she won’t do so as president. Trump says making America great again is much better than “making America whole” again. Trump again, Trump says Rubio has had a “tough night” but says he is a “lightweight. ” Trump says special interests and the lobbyists who want “their little Senator” do what they want are going to spend $25 million to oppose Trump.

Ryan is obviously frustrated he even has to point out that a presidential candidate in his party shouldn’t accept support from white supremacists. But we’d posit Ryan’s frustration stems not just from what Trump says but also from how powerless Ryan knows he is to stop Trump, both from saying these kinds of things and from potentially winning the nomination. 1:02  —   Team Kasich touting    Ohio victory versus Trump: 17 points, Mr. Trump. 17 points. pic. twitter.   —   John Kasich (@JohnKasich) March 1, 2016,  12:49  —   Bloomberg does some number crunching on Trump’s media monopoly strategy: All told, Trump’s     punch effectively deflated Rubio’s hopes of dominating the   Tuesday media narrative following his feisty debate performance.

       "        <td>Welcome to Breitbart News’s daily live updates of the 2016 horse race. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Ben Carson debate in Houston tonight in the the last debate before Super Tuesday. [ —     In a   interview, Trump tells CNN’s Chris Cuomo that Rubio and Cruz are doing very badly in the polls and that is why they attacked him. He said the debate was “exciting” and “great. ” Trump says he has dealt with “much tougher” people than   and he says voters will see that he is the type of guy who can “handle people” and it “shows what you’re made of. ” Trump says he has enjoyed all of the debates and the process. He says the problem with Rubio is that he is a “choke artist. ” Trump says “we can’t have a choke artist. ” He says he has learned from sports that “when you’re a choker,  you’re always a choker” and we can’t risk having a “choke artist” in the Oval Office. Trump thinks the race will be over “fairly quickly” and there will not be a contested convention. Trump says Rubio is a “meltdown guy” who is always “pouring down sweat. ” “We have to have somebody who doesn’t sweat,” Trump says. Trump says the race is “not over until it’s over” as Yogi Berra would. Trump says the debate was “unfair” to   because they were not asked that many questions. He says Carson was particularly treated unfairly. “He had a right to be upset,” Trump says. Trump says Romney was a “horrible candidate” who lost a race that should have been won easily. He says Romney is “just trying to remain relevant” because nobody is talking to him anymore. He says the IRS may be auditing him because he is a “strong Christian” and “maybe there is a bias. ” Trump says his tax returns all relate to each other and nobody would ever put out their returns that are under audit  …     Trump says he knew   would attack him but thinks neither were very effective. He says the debate was a “really good test. ” Caution: Remember that all of the pundits jabbering about tonight’s debate have gotten everything wrong about this election cycle.  Joel Pollak’s take: In one way, @realDonaldTrump won #GOPDebate because @marcorubio fans will insist he won, so he will stay  keep splitting vote with @tedcruz,  —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 26, 2016,   —   Cruz says in a   interview that the debate provided a lot of clarity that Trump is not a good candidate to face Hillary Clinton. Cruz says it was striking that he ran away form his previous position of supporting socialized medicine. Cruz says Trump just calls people “liars” when they bring up his past policy statements. He says Trump’s positions would fit well in the Democratic party but Hillary will win if he is the GOP nominee. When asked if he is worried that Trump’s “branding power” is tripping him up, Cruz says he will have a strong super Tuesday and Trump is attacking him because he is the only candidate who can beat Trump and is the only candidate who has beaten him. Cruz says Trump goes “nasty” because he can’t respond with substance. He says Rubio is not even winning his home state and says that is troubling. Cruz says Trump needs to release his tax returns even more so because he is being audited. He attacks Trump for having donated to the Clinton Foundation and says Trump can’t raise that issue with Clinton. Cruz mockingly says he is “shocked” that the pundits think Rubio had a good debate performance. Cruz says Rubio had a good debate performance because he finally took on Trump. Cruz says Marco is his friend and not his enemy. Cruz says Trump is a “charming guy” who can “turn on your in an instant. ” He says Trump has a hard time dealing with dipping poll numbers. Cruz says he was glad to see Rubio attacking Trump. Cruz says Jeb was the only other person other than himself who has shown the backbone to take on Trump and he says the other candidates should have taken on Trump earlier. Cruz says Super Tuesday is the best opportunity to stop Trump and asks voters to vote for him because he is the only person who can defeat Trump for the nomination and defeat Clinton, Sanders or “whatever Socialist” they nominate. Closing statements: Trump says nobody knows politicians better than he does. Trump says he will get all the things he is talking about —  fairer trade, building up the military, taking care of vets, ending common core, knocking out Obamacare —  done while the politicians will never be able to. Cruz: He says Washington deals are bankrupting the country. He says there are several deal makers on stage but he is the only one who has stood up consistently to the deals. He will rescind every illegal executive action while instructing the Department of Justice to prosecute Planned Parenthood. He will repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, secure the border, bring back jobs and tear to shreds the Iranian deal. Rubio says the campaign has come a long way and “the time for games is over. ” He wants to bring an end to the “silliness” and the “looniness”once again embrace everything that made the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country. Kasich says he fares best against Clinton and executive experience in government matters. He says he has the foreign policy experience to also be the country’s chief executive. He vows to hit the ground running and “get America moving again. ” Carson: He first asks people to think about what kind of leader you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. He speaks about the “These Hands” movie  and says “these hands, by the grace of God,” has saved many lives and healed many families. He asks voters to “join hands with me” to  “heal, inspire and revive America. “If not us, who. If not now, when  …    ” 10:42: Rubio is asked about Puerto Rico and why he opposes granting Puerto Rico bankruptcy protection unless it is a “last resort. ” Rubio says bankruptcy doesn’t work unless you change the way you operate or you will be bankrupt again. He says it is too expensive to do business there and the tax rate is too high but Puerto Ricans did not cut their government spending. He says if the economy doesn’t grow in Puerto Rico, they won’t be able to pay down their debt and all of its unfunded liabilities. He says bankruptcy should not be a first resort for them. Rubio praises Puerto Rico’s previous governor Fortuno for doing a tremendous job. 10:41: Telemundo questioner asks Trump why he won’t build a wall along the Canadian border even tough it may be more vulnerable re: ISIS. She asks isn’t that like closing the front door and living the back door open  …    . Trump says Canada’s border is four times longer than Mexico’s and “it is not our biggest problem. ” Trump says there is a tremendous amount of drugs coming across the Mexican border and not across Canada’s. Questioner then moves on after Trump talks about the drugs flowing across the border. Telemundo anchor moves on quickly from Trump’s discussion of all the drugs Mexicans are bringing in.  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 26, 2016,  10:38: When asked about Apple CEO Cook’s remarks that forcing Apple to comply with the court order would be “bad for America,” Carson says letting terrorist get away with crimes is “bad for America. ” Kasich blasts the Obama administration for litigating the issue on the front pages of the New York Times. 10:36: Rubio says Apple should comply with the government to help unlock the San Bernardino terrorist’s phone and the government was not asking Apple to create a backdoor on its  . Rubio points out that the San Bernardino’s terrorist’s phone didn’t even belong to him and Apple’s brand is not more important than the country’s national security. Cruz points out that Rubio had been on both sides of the fence and is glad he has come to Cruz’s side. Cruz says the court order did not ask Apple to create a backdoor for all phones and Apple doesn’t have a right to defy a valid court order to help the feds to unlock a specific phone. 10:32: Cruz says Trump is like a Washington lawmaker who calls people liars. Cruz points out that Jimmy Carter said he would favor Trump over Cruz because Trump is more malleable. Cruz says “falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie” and it is something Trump does daily. Cruz says it was “disgraceful” what Cruz did to Carson in Iowa. Cruz says Trump knows politicians much better than Cruz because he has been funding liberal Democrats for 40 years. Trump points out he has funded Cruz. Rubio says he Trump has never funded Rubio. Kasich begs Blitzer to take control as Cruz, Rubio, Trump just keep talking over each other. 10:31: Kasich says the Obama administration has created a “cesspool” in Libya and we have ISIS in   because of Obama’s disastrous and incoherent foreign policy. Kasich says we have to “assert ourselves as Americans” and armed the Ukrainians. 10:24: Romney keeps attacking Trump: . @realDonaldTrump taxes for last 4+ years are still being audited. There are more #bombshells or he would release them.  —   Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) February 26, 2016,  No legit reason @realDonaldTrump can’t release returns while being audited, but if scared, release earlier returns no longer under audit.  —   Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) February 26, 2016,  10:23: Trump says the Syrian cease fire is “meaningless” because all parties are not adhering to it. Cruz is hopeful that the violence will cease but there are reasons to be skeptical. Cruz says John Kerry has been the most   Secretary of State and blasts Rubio for voting to confirm him while slamming Trump for donating to him. Rubio says that every day John Kerry wasn’t confirmed was another day Hillary Clinton would have been Secretary of State. Trump says he is “no fan” of Kerry because the Iran Deal is one of the worst deals every negotiated. Cruz says Trump will apologize for having supported toppling Qaddafi in Libya. He also accuses Trump for supporting   politicians for four decades. Trump says there is nobody on stage that has done more for Israel than he has. He says politicians are “all talk and no action. ” Trump says Rubio is a “choke artist” and Cruz is a “liar. ” 10:20: Carson says he was never audited until he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast. Carson says the IRS is “not honest” and “we need to get rid of ’em. ”  Carson says we can always be fair to other people while never rejecting Israel. Carson says America has to project strength to North Korea because that is what they understand. Carson says North Korea’s Un needs to know if they shoot a missile at is “it’ll be the last thing he ever does. ” 10:16: Trump: Nations America defends around the world need to “Reimburse” USA, Kasich says we must arm South   with ballistic missile technology to counter North Korea. Kasich also says the Chinese give us the best chance to calm North Korea down. He says  you have put pressure on the Chinese and find any means you can to settle the situation. When asked if he would risk war for regime change, Kasich says it would depend on what the situation is. But he says we are going to face this sooner or later and we can’t keep kicking the can down the road. He would love to see regime change and says perhaps the Chinese can accomplish that. Kasich says we have unite Asian nations to stand firmly against North Korea. Trump blasts the omnibus budget and says we can’t keep continuing countries all over the world and says we have to be get “reimbursed” for defending countries all over the world. Kasich speaks passionately about Pentagon reforms as well. 10:14: Rubio accuses Trump of taking an “ ” position because the Palestinians are not honest brokers. He says a peace deal is not possible with the current makeup of the Palestinians. He says he will be on Israel’s side every single day because they are the only     democracy in the entire Middle East. Trump says Rubio is not a negotiator and has melted down. Rubio says Trump thinks Palestinians = real estate deal. He tells Trump that “this is not a real estate deal” because Palestinians are terrorists. Trump says the peace deal is probably the toughest deal of any kind. 10:12: Kasich says he hasn’t given as much to Israel as Trump but he has always supported Israel. 10:11: Cruz says the notion of neutrality is based on moral equivalency that mainstream media peddle  …     he says America will stand with Israel and says he has always stood with Israel. Trump says he has been a “big contributor” to Israel and it bringing peace would be one of his greatest achievements as president. 10:10: Trump says Obama has treated Israel terribly. He says he was the Grand Marshall for the Israeli Day parade. He says nobody is more   than he is but he can’t demean the Palestinians from the outset if he wants to negotiate peace. 10:00: Trump says he is beating Clinton even though he hasn’t even started on her. [Trump has arguably damaged Clinton more than any other Republican by forcing them to retreat from their “war on women” rhetoric.] Cruz says the mainstream media will go crazy if Trump is forced to testify in a fraud trial while he is the GOP nominee. Cruz says we can’t win the election with a candidate like Trump who agree with Hillary Clinton and can’t take it to her on the debate stage. [Tony Lee: Cruz and Rubio are predictable politicians. Hillary’s team and her allies can game plan for them easily. They can’t prepare for someone like Trump and his asymmetric political warfare, and that is why a Trump candidacy would be more problematic for Clinton’s team] 9:58: Rubio says he is not being audited and will release his returns this weekend. He says we should not leave the stage until every candidate gives a serious answer about how to reduce the debt. Cruz says he will release two more years of tax returns tomorrow. Cruz says Trump should release his tax returns because he is being audited —  to ensure voters that he hasn’t done anything shady. Cruz says that Trump can’t prosecute the case against the Clintons because he has donated to the Clinton foundation. 9:57: Trump says “very few people” listen to Hugh Hewitt’s radio show after Hewitt says that Trump promised to release his tax returns on his radio show. Trump again says he will not release his tax returns until the audit is complete. 9:54: Blitzer asks Trump about his tax returns. He asks Trump if any of Romney’s accusations are true. Trump says he was the first one to file his financial disclosure form. Trump says you don’t learn anything about someone’s wealth based on tax returns. Trump says that Romney looked like a fool when he “delayed, delayed” by not filing his returns. Trump says he has been audited for 12 years but he is being audited for   years and he can’t release them until the audit is finished. 9:52: Kasich says in order to get the economy moving, you have to restrain spending while stimulating the economy. He points out he led the effort to balance the budget while he was in Congress under Bill Clinton’s administration. He says he inherited an $8 billion hole in Ohio and you have to cut in addition to innovate. He says he has a $2 billion surplus and the state’s credit is strong along with its pension. He will cut welfare and make states the laboratories of innovation. Kasich says he has balanced the budget in Washington and Ohio and he will do it again as president. Trump says Kasich’s Ohio “struck oil” and that has helped a lot. 9:49: Blitzer asks Trump about his tax  . Trump says the country will become a dynamic economy and that is why he will be able to cut taxes without increasing the country’s debt. He says we already have the highest taxes in the world and it is shutting off our economy. “We will have a dynamic economy again,” he says. Trump says he will make cuts to many of the agencies and will get rid of the “waste, fraud, and abuse. ” “We will cut so much your head will spin. ” 9:45: Kasich says healthcare is not a right but the responsibility of the country. He talks up his health empowerment accounts. He says family members will be allowed to shift money around so a father could transfer money to his son’s fund. He says it will give people incentives to keep their family members healthy and reduce the cost of healthcare across the board. Carson says nobody will want Obamacare after his healthcare reforms. Cruz wonders why everyone got to address Obamacare except for him. Kasich asks how Cruz gets that extra time. Cruz says he and Donald have sharp disagreements on Obamacare like with Planned Parenthood. Cruz says he wants to end Obamacare because it goes too far while Trump wants to end it because it doesn’t go nearly far enough. He says Trump has advocated for socialized medicine in the past. “I do not want socialized medicine,” Trump says. Trump says Obamacare will be a “disaster” for the economy. Cruz now litigates Trump and asks if he has said he is a liberal on health care. Trump says his plan is very simple. “We’re going to have private healthcare” and he will not allow people to die on the streets and sidewalks if he is president. 9:42: Kasich says “we don’t want to throw million of people out into the cold” because they have   conditions. Kasich touts reforms in Ohio and says that primary care physicians will get rewards for keeping people healthy. Kasich has also said that he would reward hospitals, 9:36: Rubio claims he led the fight against the bailout funds and blasts Trump for not following and blasts Trump for not following the healthcare debate closely. Rubio keeps asking Trump “what is your plan?” Trump says he would get rid of the lines around the states and that would bring more competition. Rubio says “now he’s repeating himself” re: Trump. 9:33: Dana Bash asks Rubio if he trusts Trump to repeal Obamacare. Rubio says Obamacare should be replaced with a system that puts Americans in charge of their healthcare. Trump says he would get rid of Obamacare but he says people should not be turned away by insurance companies because of   conditions. Trump says insurance companies are wrong to require a “mandate” that everyone purchase insurance. Trump says lawmakers like   are part of the problem. He says he is   his campaign and he won’t be beholden to insurance companies. Trump says allowing people to purchase healthcare across state lines will solve a lot of the health insurance problems. 9:31: Carson also praises Justice Scalia. “Tremendous wit and intellect,” he says. 9:28: Rubio says in the history of the republic, there has been nobody better than Scalia who has understood that the Constitution is not a living, breathing document. Rubio says Trump has not been on our side on issue after issue and conservatives may not feel at peace that Trump may be on our side on the issues that are important to conservatives. Rubio doubts whether Trump will replace Scalia with someone like Scalia. Trump says he is   and against abortion. He says he would defund Planned Parenthood because he is   but millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood because of cancer screenings, etc. 9:24: Hewitt asks Trump if he will commit that religious liberty will be a litmus test to anyone he appoints to the court. Trump says it will be. Trump points out that Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare (“might as well be called Robertscare”) and he points out that Cruz back Roberts. He says Roberts has been “a disaster”  and again says “Ted very strongly pushed” Justice Roberts. Cruz says he would have nominated J. Michael Luttig instead of Roberts but says he supported him after Bush nominated him. Cruz says Trump has given money to Democrats and he will “cut a deal” on Supreme Court Justices. Cruz says he will not apologize for defending the Constitution when Trump suggests he should apologize for criticizing his sister, who is a federal Judge. Cruz says it’s amazing that Trump is insisting that deals need to be cut in Washington. Trump asks if Cruz is talking about himself when he is talking about a “crazy zealot. ” 9:22: Hewitt asks Cruz if he trusts Trump to nominate conservative Supreme Court Justices. Cruz says the court his hanging in the balance with Scalia’s passing. He says in the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constructionists but the reality is that Democrats bat about . 1000 but Republicans have batted worse than . 500. He says he has spend his whole life defending the Bill of  . And he gives voters his word that every Justice he nominates will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for his children and yours. [No questions about the crimes illegal immigrants commit and Americans impacted by it. With better questioners, there could be a better debate on immigration instead of this   circus] 9:18: Maria Celeste Arraras asks Trump if he would be “unelectable” because of poll that found 80% of Hispanics have an unfavorable view of  him. Trump says he employs thousands of Hispanics and he doesn’t believe what Telemundo says (think he means Univision —  not Telemundo). Trump says he is bringing new people into the political process and the good news is he has something to do with the   numbers. [Tony Lee: Better answer would have been that he had terrible favorability ratings with GOP primary voters when he first entered the race and those numbers flipped after a few months of campaigning] Biased questioner tries to diminish Trump’s win among Hispanics in Nevada. [Tony Lee: Had that “small sample” found that Trump lost the Hispanic vote in Nevada, do you think people like Maria Celeste Arraras would try to downplay it? Hell no.] 9:17: Carson says that he addressed NALEO last year and he was the only GOP candidate who went there. He says his message is the same to every group —  this is America and we need to have policies that give   to all people. He says that is the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don’t pick winners and losers and he points out that real compassion is providing ladders of opportunity and that is a message that attracts everyone. 9:16: Kasich says the Hispanic community likes him and he wants Hispanics to have the same opportunities his family has had. 9:12: Maria Celeste Arraras wonders if Cruz is missing a huge opportunity to expand the GOP base with his conservative immigration positions. Cruz says he would not that a lot of people in the media think “you can only be Hispanic if you’re liberal. ” Cruz says he won 40% of the Hispanic vote in Texas in his 2012 Senate race while Romney was being clobbered. 9:09: Rubio says Obama’s executive orders are unconstitutional. He says he would “cancel” DACA on the first day in office. Rubio, though, said on a   network that he would keep Obama’s executive amnesty in place. What @marcorubio ACTUALLY said: ”DACA is going to have to end at some point. I wouldn’t undo it immediately. ” End 1st day? No. #GOPDebate,  —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 26, 2016,  9:07: Rubio accuses Trump of starting a fake university and brings up four of his companies bankruptcies. Trump brings up Rubio’s   problems. He says Rubio sold his house to a lobbyist and then “legislation is passed. ” Trump says Rubio lied. Rubio fighting like his political life is depending on it. But it seems like he is trying to throw everything he can against the wall (may overload some viewers) and he may come off as a petty sore loser if he keeps this up. 9:05: Rubio says if he builds the wall like he built Trump Tower, he would be using illegal immigrant labor. Trump says it’s just a “cute soundbite. ” Trump says his ties were made in Mexico and China. “Why don’t you make ’em in America,” Rubio says. “Make ’em in America. ” 9:03: Blitzer asks Trump about his vow to make Mexico pay for his wall. Trump says “I will” and the “wall just got ten feet taller. ” Cruz says he saw Vicente Fox make the statement and should be ashamed of himself for using a “filthy, disgusting word” on tv. Trump says we have a massive trade deficit with Mexico and it would cost $  billion (he says it would cost $200 billion if other politicians build it by wasting money). He says Mexico will pay for it because they are not doing us any favors. Trump says he doesn’t mind trade wars because we are losing billions with Mexico and China. He points out Mexico just took Carrier, Ford, Nabisco. 9:01: Kasich is for completing the border, a practical   program, and for granting a path to legalization (not citizenship) for illegal immigrants who have not committed a crime. He says we should not tear families apart and grab people in neighborhoods. Carson says we need to secure all of the borders and illegal immigrants should not be living underground. He says they will be allowed to stay but they will not be allowed to vote or become American citizens. He wants America to improve the economies of   America so people don’t feel compelled to come here illegally. 8:59: Cruz tells Trump that “it is not a good attribute” if you want to be liked in Washington as president. Trump slams Cruz for not disclosing his Goldman Sachs loans. 8:58: Blitzer asks Cruz what would happen to the children who are U. S.  citizens whose parents would be different. Cruz says U. S. citizens can come back while illegal immigrants cannot. Cruz says it is remarkable that Trump thinks he is the one who discovered illegal immigration. Cruz says he promised to lead the fight against, Cruz says Trump was firing Dennis Rodman on “Celebrity Apprentice” and was funding lawmakers who supported the Gang of Eight while Cruz was leading the fight against amnesty. Cruz says when you fund   politicians, you should’t be surprised if they support open borders. Cruz says Rubio is right that Trump was fined for hiring illegal immigrants. Cruz also points out that, unlike him, Rubio broke his campaign promise by spearheading the Gang of Eight amnesty. Trump fires back at the special interests in the audience who are supporting  . Trump says as a businessman, he got along with everybody and tells Cruz, “you get along with nobody. You don’t have one Republican Senator  …     backing  you  …    . You should be ashamed of yourself. ” Cruz says Trump is right that he will cut deals if elected and anyone who cares about illegal immigration would not be hiring illegal immigrants and funding Harry   Pelosi. 8:55: Rubio goes after Trump for criticizing Romney’s   comments. Rubio says Trump is the only person on stage who has been fined for hiring people illegally. Trump says “wrong. Totally wrong. ” Trump says he is the only person on stage who has hired people. Rubio: “You’re the only 1 on this stage who’s hired ppl illegally —  “ Trump: ”No —  I’m the only 1 on this stage who’s hired people. ” #GOPDebate,  —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 26, 2016,  Trump says the laws were different 30 years ago. 8:52: Right off the back, Blitzer asks Trump about immigration. Blitzer says Trump would allow the “good ones” to come back and Cruz calls that “touchback” proposal “amnesty. ” Trump says Blitzer would not even be asking the question had he not brought the issue to the fore. Trump says he will deport illegal immigrants and some —  the very best ones —  will come back. They are going to come back “through a process. ” Cruz points out the WSJ article that once illegal immigrants left the state, the wages for workers went up. But the dollars Arizona is spending on   have gone down. Cruz says we have always welcomed legal immigrants but it is a mistake to forgive those who break the laws and he says that is why he has led the fight against granting citizenship to those who are here illegally. Trump says the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio and he has endorsed him. Rubio again repeats his talking point that he will secure the border as president before the country does anything on immigration. “And then we’ll see what the American people are willing to support. ” Rubio says Trump has been   on immigration. And Rubio points out that Trump has hired foreigners instead of hiring Americans at his Florida result. 8:50: Trump says his theme is “make America great again. ” He says we don’t win on trade or anything else. He says our borders are like “Swiss cheese. ” Trump says we’re going to start winning again and “believe me, it’s going to be a big difference. ” 8:49: “Welcome to Texas,” Cruz says. He says Texas provided his family with hope. Here, his mother became the first in his family to go to college. His father fled to Texas from Cuba. Cruz said he promised to fight for Texans when he ran for the Senate and he says even Democrats tell him that though they didn’t vote for him, he is doing what he promised. “As president, I will do the same. ” 8:48: Rubio says we have to decide our identity as a country and a movement. Rubio doesn’t want Republicans to be a party that appeals on people’s  . 8:47: Kasich says that his father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal minder. He says his mother’s mother was an immigrant who could barely speak English and he is standing on this stage. Kasich says he wants people to know you can do anything you want in America. He tells young people to “shoot for the stars. America is great and you can do it. ” 8:45: Carson says you would have listened in disbelief if someone had described today’s America 30 years ago. Carson says  we will not solve any of the problems by destroying each other. “It’s not about us. It’s about the American people. ” 8:41: CNN wants to make some money. The debate will start after a commercial break. 8:40: The candidates now take the stage. 8:35: Blitzer points out that Texas is the biggest prize on “Super Tuesday. ” He welcomes former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush. 8:30: The debate starts. Wolf Blitzer will moderate. Telemundo gets a seat at the table. Conservatives like Mark Levin do not. Your RNC at work for you  …    . 8:05: Just 25 minutes until the GOP’s “  takeover. ” 8:02: Debate audience gives George H. W. Bush a standing ovation. 8:00: CNN anchors, reporters using “violent rhetoric” while previewing debate: When Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ) was nearly assassinated 5 years ago, CNN was arguably the most egregious in jumping the gun and trying to blame Sarah Palin for the assassination attempt without a shred of evidence whatsoever. And mainstream media members still wonder why so many Americans are livid at the media  …    . Yet today, after a New York Times columnist suggested that Trump’s campaign would end with someone assassinating him, CNN anchors and reporters have been talking about how Rubio and Cruz need to “kill” each other. How Trump will have to wear “body armor” tonight. How Rubio wants to “kill off” Ted Cruz tonight to consolidate the   vote. Flashback:  On the night Giffords was shot on January 8, 2011, CNN, without any evidence whatsoever in a segment the network would later come to regret, implied Palin’s 2010 map played a role in inciting the violence. They discussed how Palin’s use of the phrase, “don’t retreat, reload,” may have also created an environment that made the shooting possible. As Palin noted, “CNN, among others, implied that using a ‘crossfire’ icon (which was a tactic first employed by Democrats to illustrate political maps of districts they ‘targeted’ to win) was inciting violence. ” CNN, along with other mainstream media networks, refused to acknowledge all the examples of Democrats having used “crossfire” icons to “target” districts while rushing to link Palin to the attempted murder of Giffords and the murder of six others. Anchor Wolf Blitzer, along with television personalities Gloria Borger and Jessica Yellin, noted there was no evidence that the shooter, Jared Loughner, was motivated by opposition to Obamacare or misinterpreted Palin’s Facebook post in support of conservative candidates who would fight against Obamacare in 2010. That did not stop CNN from essentially linking Palin to the attempted murder in one of the most irresponsible segments in recent memory. Jared Loughner, who shot 18 people, killing six, while attempting to murder Giffords, was proven not to have any political leanings, and actually spoke to Giffords at a town hall event years before he attempted to kill her. Evidence would later reveal that Loughner, contrary to CNN’s initial implications, was in no way influenced by Tea Partiers, conservative media, or Palin.  7:37: CNN’s Erin Burnett says Cruz will be combative and aggressively fight back against Trump tonight.

If Kasich had dropped out before Nevada, and Rubio had gained all that support, Donald Trump would have won by 18 points instead of 22. If Kasich dropped out before Florida and every single one of his votes went to Rubio, Rubio would lose Florida by 9 points. If Ted Cruz and Ben Carson also dropped out, Rubio would need to pick up nearly   of those votes to beat Trump  —   in his home state. The reason we are talking about Kasich having to drop out is that Kasich doesn’t have much support. So   even all of that “establishment” vote to Marco Rubio doesn’t add much value to his candidacy. Allocating all of Kasich’s vote is faulty in its own right. NBC’s most recent national poll with SurveyMonkey explored the second choices of supporters of each remaining Republican. A quarter of Bush supporters didn’t know where they’d go. Eleven percent went to Trump, 19 to Rubio. A quarter of Kasich supporters said they’d go to Rubio  —   but 16 percent said they’d back Trump. A fifth of Carson backers would go to Trump, as would a quarter of Cruz supporters. These numbers vary by state, and so on, but the point is obvious: Voters are not moving between candidates as a bloc. That’s hugely advantageous to the guy who’s already in the lead. He doesn’t need to add as many supporters from his opponents as they do. FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver noted on Twitter on Thursday night that Trump’s base of support is very, very solid  —   unlike many of his competitors  —   and that he likely had room to grow. 4:12: Hillary features Rep. Clyburn in new South Carolina ad: 4:05: In Mexico, Biden slams “dangerous” GOP campaign rhetoric (Media ignore instances of “dangerous” rhetoric from the left). “Some of the rhetoric coming from some of the presidential candidates on the other team are I think dangerous, damaging and incredibly ” Biden said. “But here’s what I’m here to tell you: They do not, they do not, they do not represent the view of the vast majority of the American people. ”   3:56: On CNN, Dr. Ben Carson says he still thinks he can win the GOP nomination. When asked which candidate has the most to lose at tonight’s debate, he says Cruz has to do very well because it’s in his home state. 3:55: Washington Post’s resident   idiot goes on CNN to call Trump a ‘bigot’ and ‘ignoramus’: The Washington Post’s residence dunce Jennifer Rubin, who doubted that Trump would reach 5% in the polls, calls Trump a “bigot,” “misogynist and an “ignoramus” during a CNN appearance. Rubin is the token “Republican” the   media use as their useful   to bash conservatives. Why are idiots like this given airtime on television: (Again, television bookers should read Coulter’s column on talking heads like Rubin who got Trump laughingly wrong and those who got it right) Networks like CNN lose credibility by putting people like Rubin on television. Get a clue, CNN. 3:42: Black Lives Matter activist who confronted Clinton last night finds Clinton’s apology to be phony. She adds, “I fear that we don’t know which Hillary we are voting for. ” In an appearance on CNN, Ashley Williams says “what I didn’t’ hear in that apology is an apology for mass incarceration. ” She says she also didn’t hear “her taking responsibility for the ways in which those words and her backing certain policies have affected black communities and communities of color. ” Williams says Hillary has been “inconsistent” and “I fear that we don’t know which Hillary we are voting for” —  Hillary from ’94, Hillary from 2008, or “this refined Hillary that allegedly shows up for racial justice. ” “I’m just not convinced,” she says, saying she is “unsure” how committed Clinton is to issues of   justice while adding that she wants Hillary to be held accountable for h er past statements. 3:4o: Mike Huckabee’s daughter, Sarah Huckabee, joins the Trump campaign as a senior adviser. 3:39: Trump fires back at Fox (Vicente): FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall.

Williams stood and demanded an apology from Clinton for the high incarceration rate for black Americans, and confronted her with the words of a speech Clinton delivered 20 years ago voicing support for the   theory of “ . ” [  …    ] “I thought that quote was important not only because it was her own words, but because that was her pathologizing black youth as these criminal, animal people,” Williams told The Washington Post. “And we know that’s not right and we know that’s really racist. ” “I wanted her to be confronted with that very racist thing she said,” Williams said. 3:05: On CNN, Tony Perkins thinks the Rubio camp may have planted the story about how conservative leaders may urge Cruz to drop out if he doesn’t do well on Super Tuesday, 3:03: Trump blasts Cruz again: Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn’t win South Carolina, it’s over.

Not so fast. First, the New York Times and the Washington Post have published studies that have shown that Republicans can win the White House in 2016 without the Hispanic vote. Second, Clinton is underperforming among Hispanic voters and Trump would not even need to come close to winning a majority of Hispanics to win the White House. And campaigns can change the minds of voters. What else are they for? That’s exactly what happened with Republican primary voters, who also viewed Trump extremely unfavorably when he first announced. Here’s what the Washington Post‘s Chris Cillizza, echoing what mainstream media members and the GOP consultant class were saying, wrote shortly after Trump’s announcement: You cannot and do not win anything when your numbers look like Trump’s. I can’t say it any more clearly than that. There’s nothing you can say or do  —   not that Trump would ever even consider going on an image rehabilitation tour  —   to change how people feel about you. Republicans know Trump. And they really, really don’t like him. A couple months later, he wrote: In case your detective work is at “True Detective” season 2 levels  —   for   watchers, that means not so good  —   I am the person who wrote that piece dismissing The Donald as even a   candidate for the presidency. My reasoning was pretty straightforward: Trump was regarded incredibly negatively by Republican voters.   percent of GOP voters had a favorable opinion of Trump in a May Washington   News poll, while 65 percent viewed him negatively. Eleven percent of Republicans felt strongly favorably toward Trump 43 percent felt strongly negatively. [  …    ] And then, opinions about Trump among Republicans totally flipped. That same   poll that showed Trump at   in his   ratings among Republicans in May suddenly revealed an absolutely unprecedented change in Trump’s favor in July. In that latter (and later) poll, 57 percent of Republicans viewed Trump favorably, while 40 percent regarded him unfavorably. 1:35 pm  —   They so mad. Flagship conservative journals were just boosting readership and garnering attention when they spewed out the same   drivel as   hosts and included propaganda straight from   groups with dubious backgrounds. They were just intensifying the ardor of “true believers” by excommunicating insufficiently stringent Republicans. Groups such as Heritage Action and gatherings such as CPAC who seethed hatred for the “establishment,” cheered the shutdown, convinced Republicans they sold out and eliminated all but the most strident from the “real Republican” club were just raising money and building membership. 1:23 pm  —   Fort Worth   endorses Rubio.

The process for presidential elections in the United States is governed by the Constitution. Primary elections, however, are not. They are controlled by the political parties themselves. In fact, until the 1820s, members of Congress chose the presidential nominee for each party. That elitist system started to buckle with the advent of national conventions, though delegates were still selected through state and local convention processes controlled by the parties.  —   7:45 am  —   Former RNC Chair Haley Barbour tells Morning Joe he will support Trump if he is the nominee.  —   7:42 am  —   Four new polls out of Texas range from Cruz +12 to a tie with Trump. Texas, Cruz’s home state, votes Tuesday and is do or die for Cruz.  —   7:38 am  —   Rove admits time is running out to stop Trump. “Donald Trump scored a very impressive win in Nevada, taking 45. 9% and 14 of the state’s 30 delegates to the GOP convention. But the Republican nomination is far from settled,” Rove wrote. “After four contests, only 133 of the convention’s 2, 472 delegates have been selected. ” “There is still time for the   GOP majority to coalesce around a single candidate, but not much,” Rove continued. The party has until about   to coalesce behind one person, Rove said. “If not, the hopes of the party’s   majority will suffer the same fate as Caesar. ”  —   7:33 am  —   Trump in deep trouble with Hispanic voter per Washington Post.  —   Chuck Todd says this costs Trump Florida, Colorado.

       "        <td>Welcome to Breitbart News’s daily live updates of the 2016 horse race. [ —    Kasich tells CNN he doesn’t need a “breakout moment” in the debates. When told that the math is not on his side and what happens next, he says that half of the delegates still have not been selected and he will have enough to get the nomination. Kasich says “I’m going to win Ohio” when asked if he will consider dropping out if he loses his  home state. Kasich says he is finally starting to get some time on the debate stage and “it’s working out great. ” Kasich says he and Jeb! talked about golf and his family and “that’s all I’m going to tell you. ” Kasich says he is going to be the nominee when told there will be vice presidential speculation if he loses Ohio. He says he will win Ohio and “it will be a whole new ball game. ” Rubio credits CNN for asking policy questions and preventing candidates from engaging personal attacks. Rubio says we have not had a substantive debate like that in some time and todays’ debate benefited voters. Rubio again says he regrets the personal attacks. Rubio says he doesn’t think Trump realizes his position is   but it is his sincere belief that if we pressure Israel to negotiate, it weakens them in the region and emboldens their enemies. Rubio says he is the only person who can beat Trump in Florida. He asks   voters to vote strategically because a vote for   in Florida is a vote for Trump. Rubio says the winner of the Florida primary will be the GOP nominee and he intends to be the GOP nominee. He says his intention is to win Florida and then says “we will win Florida. ” Cruz, when asked about derogatorily referring to Trump’s voters as “ ” voters,” says, “maybe I should have used a different term. ” [You think?] Cruz says voters will go to his side when they discover he has taken on Washington while Trump never has. Cruz says Republicans who don’t want to see Trump as the nominee are coming over this his side because nominating Trump would ensure that Clinton wins the presidency.  —   Cruz, speaking to Wolf Blitzer, says tonight’s debate was great because there weren’t any personal attacks. He says voters want to see real contrasts between the candidates. He thinks voters got the contrasts tonight. Cruz says Trump is “big business” while his focus is on small businesses and people who are getting “hammered” right now. Cruz says it was interesting that Trump talked about supporting liberal Democrats, bringing in foreign workers because it helped him. When asked if he was trying to get Carson’s endorsement, Cruz congratulates Trump for getting Carson’s support. He says he was glad to get the support of Fiorina, Mike Lee, Mark Levin. He says it is a   race and “you’re going to see people dividing it up” and it’s up to the voters to decide. Cruz says “we should do whatever is needed to destroy ISIS” when asked if he is in favor of sending 20, 000 troops to destroy ISIS. He says boots on the ground should be the last resort. Cruz says if the military says we need to send in troops, he will do so but we have to use overwhelming force, kill the enemy, and get the heck out. In his   interview, Trump says that this was an “elegant evening. ” Trump says the debates have been “harsh” but this evening was different. Trump insists there is a great hatred in Islam and we have to get to the bottom of it. Trump says the country will go so low if Clinton becomes president that “we will never recover. ” Trump says he thinks we’ve had enough of the debates but he says he is “pretty much okay” with two more.  Trump says Florida is his second home and predicts he will do well on Tuesday.  —   Trump says the Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it’s never known before. “They’re coming by the millions. We should seize that opportunity. These are good people. These are fantastic people. These are people that love our country. These are people that want to see America be great again. ” Trump says these people will help win elections and will ensure Supreme Court Justices who will do a “fabulous job. ” He says if Republicans lose the election, it will take the country a century to recover if Democrats appoint four Supreme Court Justices. Cruz says it is an incredible nation that a son of a bartender, a son of a dishwasher, a son of a mailman, and a businessman can run for president. Cruz says he cannot wait to stand on the stage with Clinton and tell Americans that she is asking for a third term of a failed administration. “We can do better,” Cruz says. “We can instead repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, unleash millions of jobs, defend the Bill of Rights, defend the Second Amendment, religious liberty, stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers, and we can put America safe  …     that’s the choice I will put to her this fall. ” Rubio says it is hard to believe that his father was bartender working in Miami two decades ago and now his son is running for the highest office in the land. Rubio says the moment has arrived for this generation to leave a better country to the next generation. He says we will do whatever it takes that our children inherit from us what we inherited for our parents —  the single, greatest nation in the history of mankind. In closing, Kasich says he has run an unwavering positive campaign for president to highlights his  . He wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics. He says being positive may not be interesting but it is to his family and many across America. He wants to give   back to American people. He will take care of the federal issues and citizens can take back their  . 10:57: Kasich, when asked about flexibility, says he is not talking about theory. He has reformed the Pentagon to give control to commanders in the field. He notes that he was the chief architect when we balanced the budget. He was there for welfare reform. He also went to Ohio and instituted many bipartisan reforms when the state was a “basket case. ” He says conservative principles will work but “show respect to the other side. ” 10:56: Trump is asked what other issues besides the height of the wall that he will be flexible on as president. “It depends on what comes up,” Trump says. “You never know. ” Trump says we need to have people come together and make good deals. He blasts Obama for signing executive orders. 10:54: Rubio says you can be flexible about ideas but you can’t be flexible on principles when asked how he will lead the country if he can’t be flexible (Rubio mocked Trump for wanting to be flexible at the last debate). Rubio touts his bipartisan accomplishments but he says when it comes to   Obamacare, reducing the tax burden that is not going to be bipartisan. Rubio says he will fight anyone who will raise taxes, expand government, or weaken our military. 10:51: Trump says he has not decided whether he will take contributions in the general elections. He says he decided to   his campaign through the primary and he insists that he is “ ” his campaign. He says he doesn’t want anyone to control him except for the people and he will do the right thing. Cruz says big donors have influence and blasts the “Washington Cartel. ” Cruz says Trump has been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence to support Democrats and supporting the GOP establishment’s efforts to crush the Tea Party. Cruz says Trump has not pointed to a single special interest that he will take on  …     Cruz says Trump didn’t take on Wall Street or the ethanol industry. Trump blasts Cruz for having super PACs and you have to look at people who are giving to the super PACs. Trump says he knows the system far better than anybody else. He knows the system is broken and that is why he is the person to fix it. 10:48: Rubio says he didn’t do well on Tuesday and was disappointed. He says his wife told him a story about a gentleman in Florida who just got out of surgery but holds a Rubio sign every morning. He says for him Rubio symbolizes all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children can have a better life for themselves. He says that gentleman hasn’t give up on him and “I’m not going to give up on him. ” He says he will work tirelessly every single day because this election is too important. He says this nation will make the right choice at the end of the process. 10:44: Trump is asked if he would support the GOP’s nominee at a contested convention if it were not him. Trump says he will have the delegates. He says whoever gets the most delegates should win. Trump favors plurality over a majority. “Make me president,” Trump responds when Hewitt asks what Cruz would do to ensure Trump’s supporters don’t leave if the nomination is taken from him at the convention. Cruz says Trump can be president of the Smithsonian. Cruz says he has beaten Cruz all over the country and says the media want Trump to be the nominee so Hillary wins. Cruz asks   Republicans to join his campaign and “stand together” to beat Hillary Clinton. Trump says he beats Clinton in polls and he gets better each week and he hasn’t even started on Hillary yet. 10:43: Hewitt asks Kasich about a contested convention. He asks Kasich why the person with the most delegates at the convention shouldn’t be the nominee. Kasich says you just have to win enough delegates to get the nomination but doesn’t want to get ahead of ourselves because we have more than half of the delegates that still need to be awarded. 10:41: Rubio chimes in and says law enforcement officers deserve our respect. Rubio says leadership is about  using anger to motivate us to take action. Rubio says Americans can do anything if he embrace all of the principles that have made us great and come together. 10:40: Kasich, asked the same question, shifts and talks about people worrying about jobs, trade deals, etc. He says seniors are worried they may lose their social security. Kasich says you can prey on their fears or fix their problems. He says “they want to help solve the problems right there they live and I want to give them the tools to do so. ” 10:37: Cruz is asked if these types of scenes hurt the GOP’s image. Cruz says we need to remember who it is we are working for. Cruz says we have seen for seven years a president who thinks he is above the law and acts like an emperor. Cruz asks “how man of y’all feel disrespected by Washington?” Cruz says Washington isn’t listening to the people and that is the frustration that is boiling over. Cruz says we need to nominate a candidate who remembers that he works for the people. Cruz attacks Trump’s pledge  …     he says “we are here pledging our support to you. Not the other way around. ” He says the only   he is interested in doing is pledging to the American people to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. Trump says the controversy over the pledge shows who dishonest the pledge was. He says they were just having a good time and he gets bigger crowds than Cruz because people have fun at his rallies. Trump says reporters have told him that “what they did on the Today show was a disgrace” by comparing Trump to Hitler. 10:34: Tapper asks about the man who was arrested for   a Trump protester. Tapper asks if Trump has done anything to encourage the violence. “I hope not,” Trump says. He says his supporters come with a lot of passion and they love this country. They don’t like seeing bad trade deals, higher taxes, etc. He says there is also great love for this country and he certainly does not condone that. Tapper says that Trump has said he wanted to punch a protester in the face and told supporters to “knock the hell” out of a protester and he’d pay the legal fees. Trump says he has had some protesters who have been “bad dudes. They have done some bad things. They are swinging. They are really dangerous. ” Trump says big powerful guys were doing damage to people and now shifts and says we should pay respect to the police because they are doing a tremendous job while taking tremendous abuse. 10:26: Tapper says Republicans have been concerned that Trump has praised Putin, the Chinese government’s reaction in Tiananmen Square. Trump says he was not endorsing the Chinese government and was just pointing out that it was a “strong government. ” He says Putin has been stronger for Russia than Obama has been for the U. S. but that doesn’t mean he is endorsing Putin. Kasich says the Chinese government “butchered those kids” and we ought to build a statue of the young man who faced down the Chinese government tank. He says China should not be considered an enemy but they need to realize they don’t own the South China Sea, must put pressure on North Korea, and understand that we have the capabilities to take on their systems. Kasich says China won’t be allowed to manipulate their currency and will take immediate action to protect American workers if they are caught doing so. 10:24: Tapper asks Cruz if it matters what the rest of the world things of the United States. “Of course it does,” Cruz says. He says Obama has made America the laughingstock of the world. He sent back Churchill’s bust and went on an apology tour, Cruz says. He says Obama sent a signal that our allies could not trust us. He says that was a “disgrace” and we have seen a weak Democratic president who has undermined our   in the world with Jimmy Carter. Cruz says this can change overnight and points out that Iran released the hostages the day Reagan was sworn in. He says America needs a president who will stand with our allies and stands   strength to our enemies. He says that is why on day one, he will rip to shreds Iran’s nuclear deal. 10:22: Kasich believes we contribute to climate change. He says we want all sources of energy. Coal, natural gas, solar, wind, renewables. He says we don’t know how much humans actually contribute to climate change but we can have strong environmental policies with economic growth. He says they are not inconsistent. 10:19: Debate now turns to climate change. Candidates are asked about Miami mayor’s request to deal with climate change. Rubio says the climate is changing because the climate is always changing but he says the flooding in Miami is caused because South Florida was build on swamplands. But he says there is no law that you can pass to change the weather. But he says the climate change laws will have no impact on the economy while American workers foot the bill. He says he is in favor of a clean environment but “these laws” will do nothing for the environment while hurting and devastating our economy. Tapper points out that the Republican Mayor of Miami believes in the “scientific consensus” on climate change and if he tells the mayor who endorsed him if he is wrong when they meet. Rubio says the mayor will hear from South Floridians who are barely getting by when their electricity bills go up 30% . 10:17: Bash focuses the debate back on Cuba. She asks Kasich about the Americans who got the first contract to build a factory in Cuba. Kasich says he would not encourage more to pursue contracts in Cuba. He blasts Obama’s foreign policy for not backing the freedom fighters in Ukraine, walking away from the red line in Syria, undercutting Egypt, turning our back to Netanyahu. Kasich says we will arm the Ukrainians, destroy ISIS, and make sure China faces consequences for hacking, and Putin understands not to cross us. Kasich says the world is begging for a stronger America and says “we’re coming back” if he is president. 10:08: Debate turns to Cuba. Tapper notes that two candidates have parents who were born in Cuba. Bash mentions that Trump agrees with Obama to reengage relations with Cuba. Rubio says hundreds of millions of dollars will go to the Castro regime and “nothing will change” for the Cuban people after the “opening. ” He says the only thing that will change is that the Cuban government will have more sources of revenue to carry our their repression. Rubio points out that Burma had to make some democratic changes while Obama asked for nothing in return from an   Communist regime who is also harboring American fugitives. Trump says he would want to make a “good deal” because everything is in Cuba’s favor. Trump says he would have the embassy in Cuba closed until a good deal was  . Rubio says we don’t have to close the embassy but he says he doesn’t know where Cuba is going to sue us but if they sue is in a  court of Miami, they will lose. Rubio says Cuba should have free elections, stop putting people in jail for speaking out, has freedom of the press, stops helping North Korea evade sanctions, etc. Cruz says this exchange on Cuba highlights a choice for GOP voters. He wants voters to ask if they want to continue Obama’s foreign policy. Cruz says the   deals were negotiated by   and Trump supported them. Cruz says we shouldn’t send millions to nations that hate us so they can try to murder us. Cruz continues to blast Trump for supporting  . And he says when it comes to Iran, Trump has said he would leave the deal in place and that reflects that Trump doesn’t understand the racial Ayatollah wants to murder us. He says we need a president who understands that we can’t give funds to terrorists who want to kill us. 10:07: Kasich says when a veteran comes home, vets must have access to healthcare wherever they want. He says the Pentagon needs to share more information with the states so veterans can be linked with jobs in the states. He says no veteran ought to be without healthcare, homeless, and unemployed in the United States of America. 10:06: Rubio says those involved in the VA scandal need to be held to account. He even praises Sanders for working with him on a bipartisan accountability act. Rubio says if he is president, those at the VA who are  not doing a good job will be fired. 10:03: Cruz says we need to do whatever it takes to defeat ISIS, that includes arming the Kurds. Cruz blasts Obama’s rules of engagement for tying the arms of our soldiers behind their backs. He says it is “wrong and immoral. ” And he gives his word that “that will end in January of 2017. ” Hewitt asks Kasich if he will follow the Pentagon’s advice if they need 20, 000 troops on the ground to defeat ISIS. Kasich says there has be “shock and awe” and once we wipe out the terrorists, we have to let the regional powers redraw the maps. Trump says “there’s no choice” because we have to knock out ISIS. He says he will listen to the general but has head 20, 000 to 30, ooo troops will be needed to knock out ISIS. Trump says “we don’t fight like we used to fight. We used to fight to win. ” Trump says “we have to knock ’em out. We have to knock ’em fast.. ” and then rebuild America. 9:59: Rubio accuses Trump of having an “ ” foreign policy because Israel’s enemies want to get rid of Israel. Trump says if he becomes president, protecting Israel will be an “absolute priority” but he would love to give a peace deal a shot. Trump insists he is the most   person running. Trump every single Israeli he knows wants peace in the region. 9:56: Trump says nobody is more   than he is. He has made massive contributions. He has a Jewish    and daughter and two grandchildren. He was also the Grand Marshall of the Israeli Day Parade. Trump wants the other side, though, to think he may be neutral in order to get a deal done. Trump says the Iran Deal is the worst deal he has ever seen and he “will be so tough” on them and that deal will be broken unless they behave. Cruz says we need a president who understands the country’s national security. He blasts Trump for wanting to treat Palestinian terrorists “neutrally” while they pay the families of terrorists who murder people. He accuses Trump of having the same moral relativism as Obama. 9:52: Trump is asked about how he would take out the family of terrorists while abiding by the law. Trump says people are chanting “death to the USA” in mosques across the Middle East. He says that doesn’t sound friendly to him. Trump says ISIS chops off heads while America is “working on a different set of parameters. ” Trump says we have to obey the laws but “we have to expand the laws” to fight on somewhat of an equal footing or we will never knock out ISIS. He says we are “suckers” and ISIS is laughing at us. Rubio says we don’t have to attack families of terrorist to defeat them. He says the best intelligence agencies in the world and the best military in the world will find the terrorists if he becomes president after he unties the intelligence agents and rebuild the military. Rubio says captured terrorists are going to go to Guantanamo and we’re going to find out everything they know. Cruz also says he will not target the families of suspected terrorists. He says he understand that people are scared because we have faced terrorist attacks and Obama lecture on intolerance. He says the solution is not to yell “China bad, Islam bad. ” Cruz says one concern he has with Trump is he doesn’t want to rip up the Iran Deal. He blasts Trump for wanting to be neutral between  . 9:50: Kasich doesn’t think Islam hates us but there is a sect that poses a great threat to us today. He says that is why the world has to work together so we don’t have a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 9:47: Rubio says Trump says what people wish they could say but Presidents can’t say whatever they want because it has consequences here and abroad. Rubio says he met a couple who were missionaries in Bangladesh. He says they are operating in a hostile environment because of all of the reports that leading GOP presidential candidates hate Muslims. Rubio says nobody on stage has worn a uniform and everyone who has died for the country loves America after talking about Muslims soldiers who have died. Trump says Rubio can be “politically correct” and we “have a serious, serious problem of hate” and he wants to solve problem. Trump says a large portion of Islam hates us. He says Muslims also treat women “horribly. ” Trump says it would be easier for him to be politically correct but “we better solve the problem before it’s too late. ” Rubio says he’s not interested in being “politically correct. ” He is interested in being “correct. ” He says Islam has a problem with radicalization but it is also true that we have to work with Muslims who are not radical to solve the problem of radical Islam. He names Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. 9:46: Trump is asked when he said “Islam hates us” if he meant all of the 1. 5 billion Muslims. “I mean a lot of ’em,” Trump says. He says he will stick by what he said to CNN last night. 9:38: Cruz says Trump is right about the problems on trade but his solutions —  like a 45% tariff —  don’t work. Cruz says Trump’s tariffs will make the prices of goods go up 45% and the countries we trade with will impose their own tariff. Cruz says his tax plan —  which will tax imports and not tax exports —  is a better plan. “Fix the problem,” Cruz says. Trump responds and says the 45% tax is a “threat” and “not a tax. ” He says it will be a tax if they don’t behave. He calls our trade deals with China “stupid trade. ” Trump says “we can’t get into China. ” Trump says the 45% tax is a threat and if they don’t behave, we will tax you something (doesn’t have to be 45%) because “our jobs are going to hell. ” Cruz says that the American workers are going to be paying the 45% tax that Trump may impose. He asks workers how that will help workers when a 45% tax is levied on cars, diapers, clothing etc. Cruz says we have to get beyond the rhetoric of “China bad. ” Trump says it’s just the opposite. He says if they don’t behave, we will put on a tax and we will build factories here and not abroad and people will buy products made here and not in China. “We’ll make our own products,” Trump says. “And that’s the way it should be done. ” 9:36: Trump is asked about his views that are at “direct odds” with the GOP’s tradition. He is asked what the Republican Party should stand for. He says he holds views that are similar to many of the people. Trump says his candidacy is “inclusive. ” Trump says he is different on trade. He says we have had horrible negotiators and the jobs in this country, especially the good jobs, are disappearing. Trump says certain products from countries that take advantage of the U. S. must be taxed or we will continue to lose  . Trump says that is the reason why there has been an outpouring of support for his campaign. 9:35: Kasich says he actually took on Washington and won when he was in Congress by forcing the government to balance its budget. Kasich says there are young people who think they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than receiving social security checks. 9:34: Trump can’t believe “how civil it has been up here. ” 9:29: Cruz says that social security is “careening towards insolvency. ” Cruz says for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes. But for younger workers, we need to gradually raise the retirement rate and change the rate of growth so it matches inflation. He says a portion of Social Security funds should also be put in private accounts that workers can pass along to their grandchildren. Cruz says  you can’t waive a magic wand and want the problem to go away. He says you need solutions. Cruz compares Trump to Clinton on Social Security and says he will get rid of bureaucrats that are enabling all of the waste, fraud, abuse. Cruz says if you are fed  up with Washington, the question to ask is who is going to take on Washington. Cruz says Trump has funded liberal Democrats and funded the liberal establishment while he stood up to lead the fight against Obamacare to honor his commitment to the   men and women of the country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare. He says he also stood against amnesty and implies Cruz has never stood up to lobbyists. Trump says Cruz was “in favor of amnesty” and says Arpaio and Sessions have endorsed him as proof that he is the strongest on immigration. He says “we are all in this together” and “we are going to find the answer to things. ” 9:21: Dana Bash asks Rubio about Social Security. She asks what the new retirement age should be and how much benefits should be cut. He says anyone who tells you that we don’t have to do anything on Social Security is lying. He says people who are 30 years away from retirement must accept that social security will work differently. He says people who made a lot of money will not see their social security funds grow as fast. He says these are not unreasonable changes to ask for people like himself to ensure that the program doesn’t bankrupt the country. Bash asks Rubio about specifics. Rubio wants to raise the retirement age to 68 and it will increase gradually until it hits 7o for those who are   years away from retirement. But the system won’t change for people who are close to retirement. Trump says he’s watched Democrats even though they are boring. He blasts them for not doing anything on social security. Trump says he will get rid of “waste, fraud, and abuse. ” He says it is his absolute intention to leave  Social Security the way it is and not raise the retirement age. [Tony Lee: Trump should point out that he may not want to raise the retirement age because it may not be fair to   workers who do   work.] Trump shifts to bringing “wealth back to our country” to save Social Security. Rubio says Trump’s plan won’t work because “the numbers don’t add up. ” He says getting rid of fraud is not enough. Rubio says we can’t tiptoe our way around this but Trump’s numbers “still don’t add up,” even on getting rid of foreign aid. Rubio says we will have a debt crisis if we do not reform social security and he points out that many thought his Senate campaign would end when he called for reforming Social Security when he challenged Crist. When asked if his numbers don’t add up, Trump says “we don’t bid things out” and all of the industries have fantastic lobbies that control lawmakers. Trump says “we’re going to save a fortune” by allowing bidding and he will do so because he is   his campaign. 9:16: Debate turns to education. Trump is asked what his “specific objections” are to Common Core. He says he wants local education and is against education from Washington, D. C. Trump says he was with Carson today. He mentions that Carson is endorsing him tomorrow morning and they talked for an hour about education. Great move by Trump to announce the Carson endorsement in primetime. Tapper presses Trump on the Common Core standards. He says the Common Core standards have been taken over by the federal government and the bureaucrats in Washington and they are not interested in what is happening in Miami and other parts of Florida. He says they are more interested in paychecks than educating kids. Kasich says he is for Common Core because he is for high standards. Cruz says Common Core will end when he becomes president. He accuses the Obama administration of blackmailing states to adopt Common Core by abusing executive power. He says the one silver lining in Obama’s abuse of executive power is everything can also be undone with executive power. He talks about expanding vouchers, supporting   expanding charter schools so every child can get a good education. 9:14: Cruz says we need to redefine the legal immigration system so it meets the needs of the American economy. He says we are bringing in too many   workers and illegal immigrants and that brings down the wages of American workers. He wants to build a wall, triple the number of border patrol agents, end sanctuary cities, end welfare benefits for anyone here illegally. Cruz says Democrats want illegal immigrants for votes while Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street. Rubio wants more   immigration. 9:13: Trump is asked how long his immigration pause will be. Trump says the   program is very very bad for workers. He says it is “unfair for our workers” and “we should end it. ” He says for we have to take a year or two to take a “strong, good hard look” to come up with plans that work. He says a minimum of one year, maybe two years re: immigration pause. 9:11: Kasich on Trump’s proposed immigration “pause,” Kasich says eh wants a   program and all of the illegal immigrants here should get a path to legalization but not citizenship. 9:09: Rubio is asked about Disney’s abuse if the   program. Rubio says if a company is caught abusing the program, it should not be allowed to use the program. Rubio blasts the insourcing and outsourcing companies and he says no consulting business should hoard all of the visas. Rubio says it is illegal now to use the program to replace Americans [but rarely enforced]. When asked why he won’t call for an   pause, he says he will be open to it but says he doesn’t think it takes a “pause” to enforce the program. He keeps saying that companies are violating the law when replacing American workers without telling viewers all of the ways companies can “technically” avoid violating the law. 9:07: Cruz is asked why voters should trust him on trade. Cruz says he has opposed TPP and says when it comes to trade, free trade helps Americans but “we’re getting killed in international trade right now” because we have an administration that doesn’t look out for American workers (he’s sounding like Trump). He says the steel industry is losing out and the service industry will also lose out as well. He wants to negotiate trade deals that protect Americans workers instead of corporate boardrooms. He wants to lift regulations and a tax plan that will not tax exports but will tax imports. 9:06: Rubio says there are good trade deals and bad trade deals. The trade deal with Columbia, he says, is good but some deals with Mexico are bad. He says if it is a “free and fair” trade deal, we can compete with anyone in the world. 9:04: Tapper asks why Trump would run the country differently than his businesses. Trump says nobody knows the rules better than he does. He says because of the monetary devaluations, it’s very hard for our companies to compete. He says he will take advantage of it as a businessman but as president he will change the laws. 9:03: Kasich is asked about trade. He wants “free” but “fair trade. ” Kasich says that it is critical that when countries break agreements, the process does not get turned over to international bureaucrats. He wants an expedited process when countries cheat and he will “blow the whistle” on them and stand up for American workers. But Kasich says we don’t want to leave the world because prices will go up and workers will be out of work. But he reiterates that he will not allow countries to dump products in the U. S. He says his family worked in the steel industry. 9:02: Trump says “one of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican party. ” He says millions are voting out of enthusiasm, out of love. He says some have never voted before. Trump says he is taking people from Democrats, independence, and “the whole world is talking about it. ” He says the GOP establishment should embrace what is happening. [Tony Lee: BUT WHY ARE THEY VOTING FOR YOU? Perhaps because of trade deals that the elite have supported and he, because he is   his campaign and is beholden to  nobody, can oppose? He never said why. This is where he has to get better as a candidate for the general election.] 9:02: Cruz says Florida welcomed his father 59 years ago. He says this election is about the freedom America has always had and is there for the next generation. 9:01: Rubio says this is the most important election in a generation because “our identity as a nation and a people” are at stake. He says the 21st century will be a new American century if voters make the right choice. 9:00: Kasich’s opening statement focuses on hope. He says he can take conservative policies to the White House and Washington and transfer power, money, and influence “to where you live. ” He wants to form a new partnership to strengthen America.   8:55: CNN’s Jake Tapper welcomes the candidates to the stage. And the debate is about to begin. He asks for a moment of silence to remember Nancy Reagan.

The endorsement, perhaps the most   nod for Trump since New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie backed him, was finalized Thursday morning when Carson met with Trump at    the luxury club owned by the Republican   the people said.

Hillary Clinton’s thunderclap defeat in the Michigan primary shows the Democrats are saddled with a weak candidate who has a sack load of political liabilities as heavy as Mr. Trump’s. 2:32: Interestingly, MSNBC interviewed a black union worker in Ohio about the devastating job losses that have hit the state. Though he supports Clinton, the MSNBC reporter said when he pushed him further, he said he would be open to Trump as well because of his message on  .

He doesn’t dance around the issues, he takes them head on. There are a fair amount of our members who do support Donald Trump. ” 2:2o: Sanders wearing new Florida Gators (Florida leading Arkansas at halftime) cap on the stump: Sanders takes a quick pit stop to make a phone call.

Trump, in turn, is renewing his vigorous criticism of the Texas senator, casting the rival he calls “Lying Ted” as too polarizing to break the Washington gridlock or win a general election. “The problem with Ted is that he’ll never get anything done,” Trump told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday. “And the bigger problem is that it’s impossible for him to get elected. ” Some of Cruz’s   backers have those same fears. But they fear the prospect of a Trump candidacy more. 12:00  —   Marlon Wayans suggests to an interviewer that he’d leave the country if Trump gets elected  …     but appreciates that he’s unfiltered: At least Trump speaks his mind, he says. Even if he doesn’t like what the man has to say, he respects him for expressing it honestly. “No matter how stupid he may sound, he says what he feels. People don’t say what they feel any more, people say what’s politically correct. If he would lick his hair and shut the fuck up, he could look like a president. But he opens his mouth and you just go: ‘God! ’” 11:40  —   Trump again says he’d prosecute Hillary. If the Obama administration does not pursue a criminal indictment of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump’s White House would. At the end of a friendly town hall interview aired on Wednesday night, Fox News personality Sean Hannity asked Trump whether, as president, he would pursue a criminal indictment of Clinton should Attorney General Loretta Lynch “cover” for Clinton and avoid indicting her. “You have to,” Trump responded, to uproarious cheering. 11:37  —   PPP poll does some good trolling of the GOP frontrunners on a potential Supreme Court nomination.

John Kasich’s own lawyer agrees the presidential campaign submitted fewer valid signatures than are required for the candidate to appear on Pennsylvania’s primary ballot. But he argued in court Wednesday that it doesn’t matter because an objection to Mr. Kasich’s nominating petitions was filed 13 minutes too late. At issue is whether challenges to Pennsylvania nominating petitions are due by 5 p. m. or 11:59 p. m. on the last day to file. Attorneys for Mr. Kasich and the objector have stipulated that the campaign filed no more than 2, 184 signatures with the state, and that 192 of those signatures were not valid. Republican and Democratic candidates for president must submit 2, 000 signatures to appear on the ballot.   10:35  —   WaPo: ‘Morning Joe’ abruptly ends interview with Florida governor for avoiding questions about Trump and Muslims,    10:19  —   NY Mag: How RedState and WaPo’s Jennifer Rubin urged Marco Rubio to light himself on fire, Brutal: Even after his Super Tuesday debacle, McLaughlin was touting hopeful signs for Rubio. (“The good news for Rubio is that yet again, he proved the breadth of his appeal across the map. He continues to be the only candidate besides Trump who is running a   campaign. ”) And now, like Rubin, McLaughlin is advising Rubio to drop out and support Cruz  —   the candidate who declined to follow his advice to focus on disqualifying Trump. There’s no sign here of introspection from Rubio’s former cheerleaders, no confession that the strategy they advocated, and insisted was working in the face of mounting evidence, had failed. It’s just the remorseless pity of Otter in Animal House: “You f[**]ed up  —   you trusted us. ”   9:41  —   Poll: Rubio gaining on Trump in FL, Donald Trump is in a tight contest with Marco Rubio in the Florida senator’s   Republican presidential primary, according to a new Washington   News poll. Trump edges out Rubio slightly: 38 percent to 31 percent among likely Republican voters in the Sunshine State. Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) places third with 19 percent, followed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 4 percent.   9:26  —   Politico Fail: MSNBC, CNN, NBC, and even Meet The Press are making the Hitler comparisons. But Politico focuses on two   comedians: Quit Comparing Trump to Hitler! It’s difficult to say when the Hitler analogies got out of control. Maybe it was when Donald Trump started asking people at his rallies to raise their hands in a loyalty oath, and the photos made it look like they were zealots delivering a “Sieg Heil. ” “This Donald Trump Rally Looks like a Scene from Nazi Germany,” screamed a headline from The Huffington Post. Or maybe it was when, over the past several weeks as Trump has edged closer to the nomination, everyone from comedians Bill Maher and Louis C. K. to no fewer than three Mexican presidents began to say flatly that we are living in Weimar America, with Trump as the potential new Fuhrer. “Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while,” Louis C. K. wrote in an email to his fans this week. “But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. ” This is absurd. Granted, Trump’s combination of outsider populism,   appeals to ethnic and racial resentment and   talk are far more likely to invite comparisons to populist tyrants like Hitler (or Mussolini, another popular Trump analogue) than to, say, Mahatma Gandhi.   9:09  —   WaPo: Four reasons Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic debate, But the most disingenuous attack of the night came when Clinton interjected: “I just think it’s worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising Senator Sanders. ” She was referring to a web video released by Freedom Partners, part of the Koch political network, which highlighted Sanders’s opposition to the reauthorization of the   Bank. Just as Obama did (until he became president) the Vermont senator sees federal   loans to General Electric and Boeing as corporate welfare.   9:06  —   NBC: Trump has highest unfavorable rating of any frontrunner ever.

Along with most media pundits in the Northeast, I found it improbable if not impossible that Trump could survive his    cascade of    flubs, from carelessly categorizing Mexican immigrants as rapists to hallucinating about “thousands’ of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers from the mean streets of New Jersey.  Surely he would soon implode and pouf into fairy dust! But only a few weeks after that interview of mine in Salon, I suddenly realized that Trump’s candidacy had a broad support that few had expected or discerned.  The agent of my revelation was a hilariously scathing, viral Web blog video posted by Diamond and Silk —  Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, two   sisters and former Democrats in Fayetteville, North Carolina.  They were reacting with indignant outrage to the first GOP debate, broadcast by Fox News from Cleveland on August 6 and hosted by Megyn Kelly, whose loaded questions had impugned Trump as a sexist.   …     This fiery endorsement blew me away because it demonstrated how Trump was directly engaging with a diverse coalition in ways that the mainstream media had completely missed.  I felt, and still do, that Trump is far too impetuous and   in his amusingly rambling, improvisational style.  The American president, who can spook markets or spark a war with a rash phrase, must be more coolly circumspect.  And aspirants to the presidency shouldn’t care what small fry like   TV hosts say or do.  A leader must have the long view and show an instinctive capacity to focus and prioritize.   8:02  —   “Ted Cruz Says Donald Trump’s Voters Have “relatively low information” And Are “not that engaged” Listen, Donald does well with voters who have relatively low information, who are not that engaged and who are angry and they see him as an angry voice.

When they inform themselves, they realize his record. He’s what they’re angry at. He is the corruption, and if you want someone to stand up to Washington, the only one who has been doing so in this race is me. ”   7:57  —    #WhichHillary: Twitter shuts down hashtag critical of Clinton, So why this sudden reversal? Why would Twitter shut down a grassroots hashtag that was leading a discussion regarding a Democratic primary? The answer lies in that old saying, “follow the money. ” Three days after Omid Kordestani, the executive chairman of Twitter, hosted a   fundraiser for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, a Black Lives Matter activist’s notable protest at another fundraiser inspired #WhichHillary  —   to open debate about Clinton’s often conflicting record on issues. #WhichHillary exploded within hours of the protest and rose to the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter. Clinton, who canceled several financial industry fundraisers recently( most likely to prevent a Wall Street optics dilemma) has lately been relying on donations from the   tech community. All this occurred within days of the South Carolina primary. As South Carolina voters were making up their minds, this massive campaign challenging Clinton’s history with the   community became the No. 1 most discussed topic on Twitter. Yet it came to a sudden halt and was pushed off the trending topics list as its momentum kept building. (And the hashtag’s creator’s account was even suspended.)   7:52  —   Ohio’s ‘dirty little secret’:   Democrats for Trump, If Donald Trump wins the Republican Party nomination, his path to the White House will run through this   city with a knack for picking presidents.

The next debate is Fox News’  Kelly’s. Trump says the networks should donate some of the proceeds to vets. He also says that because of him, the debates are ridiculous and have become the “Super Bowl of cable television. ” Trump says he can recite what everyone is going to say and even jokes that he knows Carson will justifiably complain that he is not getting enough air time.   7:55: After it takes a bit of time for a protester to be removed, Trump says “in the good old days, law enforcement acted a lot quicker. ” Trump says he loves the police but “they are afraid to move” because they want to keep their jobs and not lose their pensions. He says “everybody is politically correct” and “our country is going to hell. ” He says America is becoming a “frightened country and it’s very, very sad. ”   Trump says waterboarding is “just fine” and “if you want to go a step above —  or two or three steps above —  “then that’s fine too. ”   7:42: Trump also says Rubio had a “credit card problem” in Florida. This may be the first time Trump has brought up Rubio’s  “credit card problem” after vowing last week that he would hit back at Rubio if Rubio started to attack him. He says Rubio was “taking from the Republican Party” and “having his driveway done and all of this” on the Florida GOP’s credit card. Trump says “the man doing the investigation is furious” because “they are not listening to him” and maybe Trump should interview him.

Though generally seen as   and quick on his feet, Rubio is known to friends, allies, and advisers for a kind of incurable anxiousness  —   and an occasional propensity to panic in moments of crisis, both real and imagined. This jittery restlessness has manifested itself throughout Rubio’s life, from high school football games in Miami to   policy fights in Washington  —   and in some ways, it’s been the driving force in his rapid political rise. 6:37: Trump dominant in Super Tuesday states: . @marcorubio: ”[@realDonaldTrump’s] been exploiting working Americans for forty years.” @BretBaier pic. twitter.   —   Fox News (@FoxNews) February 26, 2016,  6:30: Top Christie backer Ken Langone tells the Wall Street Journal that he thinks Trump will change things for the better as president.

John Kasich. “I think if Trump is going to become president, things are going to change and for the better,” he said. “I’m not concerned in the least.

What?  —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 26, 2016,    4:05:  [Tony Lee] Rubio Misfired When He Tried to Attack Trump for His Twitter Typos: For arguably the first time in this campaign cycle, Rubio received live coverage from all the cable networks. And he may have inadvertently blown it. Rubio allies are praising him for ripping Trump this morning and afternoon, but his attacks may backfire on him in three ways. First, nobody cares about typos on Twitter because everybody has made them while Tweeting quickly. Second, Rubio repeated Trump’s criticisms of him —  that he is a lightweight and a choker who melts down —  on national television and it will be replayed over and over again. Guess what? Voters may start to think that he is a choker. At the very least, Rubio ensured that more voters became aware of Trump’s criticisms of him as a “chocker. ” All he did was give those criticisms more airtime. Genius. Third, when a politician’s actions do not line up with the image that he has tried to project to voters, he comes across as a phony in an election cycle when voters are craving   “authenticity. ” And that’s what happened to Rubio when he implied that foreigners can’t spell while criticizing Trump: So how does this guy, not one tweet, but three tweets misspell words so badly? I only reach two conclusions. Number one, that’s how they spell those words at the Wharton School of Business where he went. Or number two, just like Trump Tower, he must have hired a foreign worker to do his own tweets. Trump can make such comments because he has presented himself to voters as someone who is unapologetic, brash, and politically incorrect. Rubio, on the other hand, can’t because he is presenting himself as Mr. “   Correct” so attacks like that make him seem more like a phony and goes against the core of his brand. Rubio and his allies may be cheering his debate performance and “cute soundbites,” but they may not realize he is coming across as “that guy” who desperately hurls insult after insult at the guy who is dating the girl he has always wanted. It’s funny that Rubio’s allies in the permanent   class seem way more like “that guy” than the guy who gets the girl, and that is why they are myopically   each other over Rubio’s performance. The joke may be on Rubio and his “smart set” of “experts” in the end. 4:05: Drudge Report Headline: Trump Campaign Juggernaut:   too. Very significant  .

       "        <td>Welcome to Breitbart News’s daily live updates of the 2016 horse race. [ —    11:00 Trump speaks glowingly about his five children. He says he was a great parent because he put his children above everything. Trump says his brother’s alcoholism taught him a tremendous reason and his brother is why he has never had alcohol and smoked cigarettes. He says he has seen what alcohol does to people and says “if you don’t drink, there is no temptation. ” He says he always told his children “no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. ” [Strong answer by Trump —  and a story he should tell more often] Trump says maybe he works too hard with his businesses and his jobs probably came before his first two wives. He says he was a better father than husband. He is proud of the thousands of employees that have succeeded under him. 10:58: Trump says he watches a lot of television news (say what you want about Trump, but keeping up with the daily news cycle probably has made him a better candidate than candidates who are put in a bubble by their advisers) and gets about four hours of sleep a night. Trump on Arnold: “He’s no Trump. ” [Tony Lee: Conservatives hoping Trump is “no Arnold”]   10:56: Trump says he sometimes bring fast food on his plane. Says he like Big Macs and Fish delights (Tony Lee: fish filets? ). He says he had Kentucky Fried Chicken (Tony Lee: Their pot pies are great) the other night and likes Burger King. Trump says sometimes fast food restaurants may be safer than some places where you don’t know where the food is coming from. He likes Elton John, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Michael Jackson (Trump says he lost his confidence because of bad surgeries). 10:53: Trump says he doesn’t even know what his sister’s views on abortion are and says there are times when he doesn’t like the publicity he gets. He says the political press are “so dishonest” and says his sister is “not radical anything” and “is a great intellect” and a “great judge. ” But Trump says he would not appoint his sister to the Supreme Court because it is a conflict of interest and Cooper points out that he has never said he would appoint his sister to the Court. 10:52: A South Carolina GOP activist asks Trump about     tensions. He wants to know what his administration would do to make sure that law enforcement officers have the type of support they need. Trump says he is a “big, big supporter of the police. ” He says the police are being treated horribly in this country and is “without question a huge supporter of the police” even though there may be a few bad apples. Trump says the police are “mistreated” and “misunderstood” and they deserve much more credit than they are getting now. 10:50: Trump says his greatest fault is putting up with   for too long. But he says when he gets to it, he is too tough and he never forgets. One of the first times Trump has opened up a bit this election cycle. Very relatable answer. 10:48: After a lengthy commercial break that allows CNN to pay its bills, Cooper asks Trump about his comments on the Howard Stern show about being in favor of invading Iraq. Trump said he was against the War right   after it started. 10:42: A small business owner asks Trump what type of people he would consider for his cabinet. Trump says he wants the most talented people, regardless of party affiliation. 10:37: Questioner asks Trump about his comments about how George W. Bush lied to get us in the Iraq War. Trump says a lot of people agree with what he says about how Saddam Hussein was not responsible for  . He says going into Iraq was the worst decision made by a president perhaps in the history of the United States. Trump says he is the one who didn’t want to go to War with Iraq, so it is not fair raise questions about his having his finger on the nuclear button. Trump says Bush went into Iraq because he was loyal to his father and “destroyed” the Middle East. Trump says Obama got us out the wrong way as well. 10:31: Trump says the Republicans have been so weak on Obamacare, Omnibus budgets that allow him to bring in people from Syria and give illegal immigrants temporary amnesty. He says we have to repeal and repeal Obamacare. Trump talks up healthcare saving accounts. He stresses that he is   his campaign and is not beholden to various interests like Jeb! Trump says insurance companies are funding most of the people he is running against and the insurance companies have too many Senators under control. Trump says he doesn’t want people dying on the streets, though, and he says he gets a standing ovation whenever he says that and is not  . He says it’s called “heart. ” [It’s interesting that after letting most of the candidates, especially Rubio, just talk endlessly and repeat their talking points, Cooper is grilling Trump about various details. He hasn’t done that with the other candidates.] 10:26: Questioner asks Trump how he will get   from people he disagrees with without being angry. Trump appreciates the question and says “you have to be tough” in the debates and “we have to be tough to protect our country. ” He says he has a great temperament and you can’t build a great company without one. Trump says we need a certain toughness because ISIS is chopping off the heads of Christians and drowning people in cages. Trump says if we don’t have the toughness, we’re not going to have a country anymore. Trump says “we have weak people leading out toughness. ” As President, Trump says he would win with his compromises. He says the country is not based on executive orders. 10:24: Trump says he is not a “bully. ” He says he will send    letters to China and Mexico to stop ripping us off. He says “our country is going to  hell” and we have a problem with China, Mexico, Japan. He says he won’t buy Carrier air conditioners because they moved to Mexico. 10:23: Trump says questions about Cruz’s   citizen status will be a big problem for the GOP. 10:20: Re: his    letter to Cruz, Trump says Cruz has a “problem with the truth. ” He jokes that Cruz’s photoshopped photo of Rubio probably bothered Rubio because the photoshopped image was much shorter than Rubio. 10:18: Trump says he never thought he would have to ask for forgiveness today. He says the Pope is “doing a good job” and has “a lot of energy. ” He says the Pope was given “false information. ” He says he’d meet the Pope any time and he has “great respect” for the position. 10:16: Re: Francis “not Christian” remarks, Trump says it wasn’t a good thing for the Pope to say and discusses America’s trade imbalance with Mexico. He accuses the Mexican government of influencing the Pope and says it may be a little bit of a nicer statement than was reported. Trump says he will build a wall and Mexico will pay for it. “He’s got an awfully big wall at the Vatican,” Trump says re: Pope Francis’s “not Christian” remarks. Trump says he doesn’t like fighting with the Pope and says he doesn’t think this is a fight. He says Pope Francis only heard the Mexican government’s side of the story and knows nothing of the tremendous strain illegal immigration puts on America. He talks about the heroin epidemic. 10:15: “The Pope is a wonderful guy,” Trump says after Cooper quips that Trump’s had quite a day. 10:11: Trump, the main event, is up next. 10:10: Cruz campaign slams Rubio for bailing on the Conservative Review Summit: “This is a final admission that Marco Rubio isn’t even going to try to compete for the votes of conservatives in South Carolina or anywhere else,” said Rick Tyler, Cruz Communications Director. “And who can blame him? Rubio isn’t a conservative. Instead Rubio and his campaign would rather hide behind their deceptive campaign tactics and liberal record on amnesty for illegals and voting to nominate John Kerry. ” 10:07: Bush listens to country music. Bush says his communications director Tim Miller thinks he’s crazy for actually liking his campaign music. Bush says his brother has gotten pretty good at painting and he likes to do “Sunday Sunday” with his granddaughters to relax. He likes making guacamole, reading, and playing speed golf. He says he just finished a book about his dad. Bush complains that people in his generation need to “emote” like Bill Clinton. Bush says he’s an introvert and introverts set goals and grind, which is pretty good if you have been written off over and over again. He says he has overcome his intmrovertdness. He says introverts like to   and not   a “big blowhard. ” 10:05: Bush says we need to create a “culture of savings” and not a “culture of debt. ” Bush says we need to grow the economy at 2% career civil service reform, entitlement reform, shift much more responsibility to the states. Bush says people should go to his site to see his plans if they want a policy   . 9:58: Questioner asks Bush about his marriage and how it impacts his leadership. Bush tells his wife that his  answer will be her “anniversary present. ” Bush mentions that he met his wife in Mexico and he can remember exactly where he was then and exactly what she looked like to this day. “Lightning bolt of love. ” Bush says his wife was the most beautiful girl he had ever met and decided he was going to marry her right then. Bush says his wife is his inspiration and his life can be divided   (Before   Columba). Bush says they mostly speak Spanish at home and it’s an advantage in life to have a bicultural relationship that adds a lot of vitality to his life. 9:53: Student asks Bush about   drug use. Bush say the terminology (“recreational”) is misleading because of the potency of some type of marijuana. He says   abuse crosses   lines and speaks about his daughter who had struggled with addiction. Bush favors a “bottom up” approach and says we should have a “moonshot” to “discover the brain, its complexities. ” He says we need to look at our criminal justice system —  50% of the prisoners in federal prison are there because of a   offense. 9:47: Questioner is “darn mad” Obama is dropping the ball in defeating ISIS in Iraq. He asks if Bush would send in ground troops to defeat ISIS. Bush says we already have ground troops but they are not embedded with the Iraqi Army. He says this is a “tragedy of our own making” and the Obama administration created the vacuum that ISIS filled with its failed Iraq policies. Bush says going forward, we should embed our existing troops that are already there inside the Iraqi military to give them the training, backbone. He says we need to reestablish the partnership with the Sunni tribal leaders that helped his brother with the surge. He says we also need to arm the Kurds with more sophisticated weapons and get the lawyers off the back of the war fighters. He wants   and   zones in Syria as well. 9:45: Jeb says he doesn’t know who he would nominate to the Supreme Court but wants to avoid making the mistake his father made with Souter. Jeb says “Justice Scalia” was the greatest lover of liberty and he is excited about this being an important election issues. 9:42: For the second time, Jeb! says “Anton Scalia. ” His family is more familiar with the Souters  of the world. 9:40: Jeb says being Catholic has a lot to do with his   views. Says we should not take faith out of the public square. 9:34: Jeb is asked about his gun Tweet. He says he received that gun as a gift from a gun manufacturer in South Carolina who sells a lot of guns to the military. He blasts the sequester and the gutting of the military. He says he wanted to pay tribute to them and support the 2nd Amendment. Jeb! would change Obama’s executive actions on gun control. 9:33: Jeb Pope Francis is an inspirational leader but says it is not appropriate to question Trump’s faith. 9:32: Jeb! is now on stage at CNN’s town hall. Trump is on deck. Cooper likes Jeb! ’s boots. He says it’s a blast campaigning with his brother and says his mom is a “superstar” whom he loves dearly. 9:25: Kasich says he was afraid that his parents would not come home at night when he was little because his dad picked his mom up on a dangerous road. He points out that he lost his parents as they were on their way from Burger King after getting free cups of coffee when they were struck by a drunk driver. He says he found the Lord after his parents died. 9:24: In Vegas, Sanders points out that Gloria Steinem once made him an “honorary woman. ” 9:20: In Vegas, Sanders talks about the high youth unemployment rates among   without talking about illegal immigration. Sanders also says he hopes that minorities are disgusted when they turn on televisions and see unarmed men, mostly   being shot. Earlier he dodged a question about having supported a primary challenger to Obama: Sanders dodges an answer on whether he still thinks Obama should have been primaried, says this whole thing is a ”media issue”  —     Dovere (@IsaacDovere) February 19, 2016,  9:18: A gun store owner mentions that firearm sales have skyrocketed the last seven years. He says his customers think their 2nd Amendment rights are being infringed. He asks if he believes that the 2nd Amendment is an individual right? Kasich says people have a right to own guns and “we don’t want to be messing around with the 2nd Amendment. ” He blasts Obama’s executive actions on gun control. Kasich says he will call the kids of every member of Congress on their birthdays. He says his opinionated mother got him interested in politics. 9:12: In Vegas, Sanders says he voted against the   amnesty bill in agreement with    because he was against the   provision that those organizations said was “akin to slavery. ” Sanders says his immigration policy is to “unite” and not “divide” families. “I don’t want to see workers in this country exploited,” he says, adding that he wants to take all of the illegal immigrants in the country out of the shadows and give them a path to citizenship. 9:05: When asked if he regrets taking Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, Kasich says the   drug addicted, and the mentally ill have benefited. 9:02: Michigan State fan in South Carolina tells Kasich that Obamacare has been a “godsend” for  him. He wants to know what Kasich would substitute for Obamacare if he is elected. He says Obamacare doesn’t control the costs that are just escalating. Kasich says health insurance costs in his state have gone up by 80% and points out that Obamacare hurts small businesses. He says he would take some federal resources and combine it with Medicare to cover the working poor. Kasich says it is   for people to lose insurance plans because of   conditions. He wants to incentivize   for giving   care at low prices. 9:00: Kasich is asked about Supreme Court Justices. He says he has appointed over 100 judges in Ohio and he tries to look for someone who is a conservative who interprets and doesn’t make law. A nominee’s temperament is also important. They also have to be beyond reproach. Justices need to be public officials and not preachers, he says. 8:57: Kasich says he will  use the bully pulpit to wage an “  war” against domestic violence. 8:52: Kasich is asked about the working poor. He says we need to make sure they have health care and it all comes down to “training and skills. ” Kasich says we have to have “lifelong learning” and keep training ourselves for today’s and tomorrow’s jobs. He refers to single moms with children as “heroes. ” 8:50: Kasich says we have a right to build walls but we need more bridges. 8:48: Kasich says he is “ ” (some people on Twitter may think he means Olivia) when asked about the spat between   Francis. He praises Pope Francis for opening the doors of the Church. 8:43: Cooper asks Kasich about his emotional embrace with a supporter earlier in the day who has overcome a lot in life. Cooper calls it an “extraordinary moment” and Kasich says it has been happening to him at various campaign events. He says “we all need to slow down a little bit” because there are a lot of people who are lonely and looking to tell people about their issues. He says the country works best when it is strong from the “bottom up. ” 8:41: Cooper says the town hall will be “conversational” and  not “confrontational. ” It looks like CNN has the same type of consultants who   responses for Rubio. 8:40: CNN’s town hall event with Messrs. Kasich, Bush, and Trump is about to start. Seems like Kasich held up the event by arriving a bit late. 7:52: Hillary: ‘I’ve Always Tried to’ Tell the Truth. She doesn’t believe she has ever lied. If you say so  …     PELLEY:You talk about leveling with the American people. Have you always told the truth? CLINTON:I’ve always tried to. Always. Always. PELLEY:Some people are gonna call that wiggle room that you just gave yourself. CLINTON:Well, no, I’ve always tried  —   PELLEY:I mean, Jimmy Carter said, “I will never lie to you. ” CLINTON:Well, but, you know, you’re asking me to say, “Have I ever?” I don’t believe I ever have. I don’t believe I ever have. I don’t believe I ever will. I’m gonna do the best I can to level with the American people. 7:50: Wintour for Hillary as well: Anna Wintour in a sequin Hillary 2016 tee at @Marcjacobs #NYFW pic. twitter.   —   Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 18, 2016,  7:42: Stump for Trump sisters want the Pope to tear down the Vatican’s wall and house illegal immigrants and let illegal immigrants bring drugs into the Vatican: 7:30: Sanders responds to Killer Mike’s “uterus” comments: New: Bernie Sanders on Killer Mike ”uterus” remark  —   pic. twitter.   —   Kasie Hunt (@kasie) February 19, 2016,  7:16: Joe Biden tells Rachel Maddow that it is “very possible” that Trump can be nominated. “I would take him seriously in terms of being able to win. ” 7:15: Ted Kennedy’s widow for Hillary. 7:12: Coulter goes off on Rubio again, calls him a “Manchurian candidate” Rubio is the Manchurian Candidate, except Manchuria is the Vatican.  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 18, 2016,  7:10: Cruz Not Attending Scalia’s funeral: Cruz said this today about Obama not attending Scalia’s funeral on Saturday, calling him ”faithless”  —  &amp;gt pic. twitter.   —   Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) February 18, 2016,  But the Cruz campaign says tonight Cruz will also not attend the funeral  —   instead, Cruz will stay in South Carolina for the primary.  —   Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) February 18, 2016,  7:07: If Hillary attacks Sanders on having not voted for the   amnesty bill, it looks like he will bring up that Clinton wanted to send illegal immigrants from Central America back during the border surge, based on Tad Devine’s (Sanders Senior Strategist)  interview with Chris Matthews. 7:05: Team Hillary testing attack lines? Days before Democratic voters will caucus in Nevada, the race in the state between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton is tighter than ever. A new CNN poll out Wednesday showed the two candidates in a virtual dead heat in the state and staff from the Sanders campaign confirmed to ABC News that they have conducted their own polling in the state and are optimistic about what they see. As the pressure builds ahead of the next contest in the primary fight, ABC News recently obtained an audio recording of what sounds like intensive message polling conducted on Clinton’s behalf to a caller in the northern part of the state. In the recording, provided to ABC News by the Sanders campaign, a woman’s voice asks a man on the other end for, among other things, his impression of both talking points that are favorable to Clinton as well as a series of attack lines against the Vermont senator. The Sanders campaign said the recording and that type of polling are evidence that the Clinton campaign is nervous about a state they once thought they had locked up. 6:55: Lena Dunham thinks Caucuses are sexy. What about lying about having been “raped” by a Republican? 6:49: Sanders Tops Hillary in National Poll for First Time: Bernie Sanders has passed Hillary Clinton at the top of a Democratic national poll for the first time in the entire 2016 race. A Fox News poll released Thursday shows Sanders with 47 percent support to Clinton’s 44 percent. 6:48: Rep. Jim Clyburn ( ) Getting Ready to Endorse Hillary: SCOOP! Sources: Rep. Jim Clyburn of S.

No mention of   borders that is the issue that represents the greatest divide between Main Street and   on the left (like Soros) and on the right (like the Kochs): The senator is upset with a political and economic system that is often rigged to help the privileged few at the expense of everyone else, particularly the least advantaged. He believes that we have a   society that increasingly dooms millions of our fellow citizens to lives of poverty and hopelessness. He thinks many corporations seek and benefit from corporate welfare while ordinary citizens are denied opportunities and a level playing field. I agree with him. Democrats and Republicans have too often favored policies and regulations that pick winners and losers. This helps perpetuate a cycle of control, dependency, cronyism and poverty in the United States. These are complicated issues, but it’s not enough to say that government alone is to blame. Large portions of the business community have actively pushed for these policies. 6:25: Noam Chomsky praises Sanders on Al Jazeera,  6:18: Why is he raising expectations?

I’m convinced he’s a Christian. I believe he has faith in Jesus Christ. [  …    ] I think John F. Kennedy would be rolling over in his grave right now if he could hear what the pope was saying, because that’s a man who fought to be president against lots of prejudice, because many protestants in this country did not want to elect a catholic president. And he broke down those barriers and now here’s the pope trying to say, we have to elect leaders. Jesus said render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s. That means choose the best president. [  …    ] Jesus never intended to give instructions to political leaders on how to run a country. And that’s clear through all his teachings. And he made that more clear than almost anything else. So I think that’s the  —   you know, Jesus told us to help the poor, but he never said vote for somebody who is going to take money from your neighbor and give it to the poor. That’s  —   Jesus never told us whether to vote for a socialist or a capitalist. He told us to render under Caesar, use our own brains to decide who would be the best political leader. 2:30: Team Hillary Pulling Out All The Stops. Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( ) the godfather of the modern amnesty movement, rips Bernie Sanders in Univision: Every time an election rolls around, candidates fall all over themselves to proclaim their allegiance to the Latino community. Hillary Clinton is different. I was proud to endorse her because she is the rare loyal candidate who has been fighting for us her entire career. It goes back to traveling across Texas in 1972 to register Latino voters and to organizing the   White House conference on Hispanic Children and Youth. But it is her time in the U. S. Senate, fighting hard for comprehensive immigration reform that sets her apart from Bernie Sanders. Hillary is the only candidate in this race who has always had our backs. Six months ago, I did an interview with Larry King where I asked whether Bernie Sanders even liked immigrants or cared about Latinos and our issues. He had been silent on immigration and our other priorities and within a week or two, Sanders was talking about immigration. He was saying all the right things, but it raised a very important question in my mind: where was Sanders when we really needed him? I have observed Sanders first in the House of Representatives and later in the Senate and I have to say, he was absent from most of the crucial immigration debates. And when he did show up, his record was troubling. 2:15: Coulter not a Rubio fan, to say the least.

(“Will there be a shakeup?” “Is Mike Bloomberg going to jump in?” “Is there any way that Joe Biden could reconsider?” “How is she losing to a democratic socialist who didn’t even belong to the party until now? ”) So it would be painful loss. But as we wrote earlier this week, a Sanders loss could even be more impactful because it would set up Hillary Clinton to start running the table over the next two weeks in South Carolina and the southern March 1 states. The Democrat Nevada caucus is this Saturday.  —   10:12 am  —   Three new national polls show Trump way ahead. NBC poll is almost certainly an outlier.

The latest poll out of Nevada has the race tied. The problem for Hillary is that if Sanders prevails in Nevada, that blows up the narrative that he can only win in predominantly white states like New Hampshire. As many as 40% of Nevada Democrat voters are minorities. The following Saturday is the Democrat South Carolina primary. Hillary is well ahead but Bernie is creeping up on her. A big win in Nevada could only put more wind in Bernie’s South Carolina sails. For the Republicans, this coming Saturday is the South Carolina primary and just a few days later on Tuesday is the Nevada primary. As of now, Trump is dominating by double digits in both states.  —   9:26  —   Slate blasts MSNBC’s Trump town hall as “disgraceful” Scarborough and Brzezinski hosted what appeared to be a rehearsed and “safe” town hall, in which American voters asked the candidate such   questions as “Why did you decide to run for president?” and “how will you set yourself apart” from other Republicans?

Guilty pleasure when he wasn’t running for president was watching movies and playing video games. He says Cruz’s iPhone drives his wife crazy because he plays so many games on it. Cooper asks Cruz about his   Bride impersonations and Cruz says part of it is “you have to have fun. ” He says Republicans reach  young people with substance —  point out that the Obama economy is hammering them along with the national debt —  and loosening up, cracking jokes, and having fun. Cruz talks about the Cruz street art that went viral last year and he pointed out that he decided to have some fun with them by posting on Facebook that he noticed a glaring error in the posters —  he doesn’t smoke cigarettes. 10:52: Question is on most important cabinet position. Cruz says it’s a   tie between Secretary of   of   General. He says “Winston Churchill is coming back to the Oval Office” when he is president. He says a Secretary of State in a Cruz administration would be someone like John Bolton. He blasts the lawlessness of the Obama administration (“one of the saddest legacies”) and says it is “sad” that the media accepts as a given re: Hillary’s email scandal that whether someone is prosecuted depends on what some hack in the White House thinks. He says the only fidelity in Cruz Department of Justice will be to the law and the Constitution. 10: 47: Cruz says he will use executive actions to end Common Core, undo Obama’s executive amnesty. He will rip up the Iran Deal to “shreds” and move the U. S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. And re: getting things done legislatively, Cruz points out that the last time conservatives defeated the Washington Cartel was in 1980 when Reagan’s grassroots army defeated the Washington establishment just four years after Reagan almost successfully primaried a sitting GOP establishment GOP president. Cruz would call on his grassroots army to compel Congress to enact his agenda. 10:42: Cruz says he will not respond in kind when others are impugning his character during the campaign. He says people in the GOP establishment say “Ted is unlikable in Washington” because he is keeping his promises to the men and women who elected him like trying to defund Planned Parenthood and leading the fight against Obamacare and the “  amnesty bill. ” Cruz says he and Jeff Sessions helped defeat Rubio’s amnesty bill in the House and that is why the D. C. establishment that loves amnesty dislikes him. 10:37: Cruz says Rubio and Trump scream “liar, liar” when Cruz points to their record and calls them out on their past statements. He points out that he was correct in saying that Trump supports Planned Parenthood and Rubio supports 1) giving citizenship to all of the country’s illegal immigrants, 2) granting citizenship to illegal immigrants even if they have criminal convictions, 3) supported   tuition for illegal immigrants in Florida, and 4) went on Univision and said in Spanish that he would not rescind Obama’s executive amnesty in his first day in office. Cruz says Rubio never disputed any of the substance. “Truth matters,” Cruz says, adding that Jeff Sessions, Mark Levin, Mike Lee, James Dobson, Phyllis Schlafly have also been lying. 10:35: Cruz says he has surged because conservatives trust him more than Trump on judges. 10:33: Cruz says we should not be confirming a Supreme Court nomination during a   period. He says Scalia, “a lion of the law”   changed the law and was the Court what Reagan was to the presidency. He says this nomination has the potential to dramatically shift the balance of power on the court and says that 2016 should be a referendum on the Supreme Court. 10:29: Cruz defends his   status and says you cannot write off the possibility of Trump suing him but it will not succeed because it will not be a “meritorious lawsuit. ” 10:27: Cruz says America’s relationship with Saudi Arabia has been “fraught with complications. ” He blasts the Saudis for paying off terrorists so they don’t destroy the Kingdom and says friends do not fund jihadists who want to kill them. Cruz says oil prices fluctuate because of the Fed and says the Fed should be audited. Cruz also calls for the return to the Gold Standard. 10:22: Cruz says we are seeing an “assault” on religious liberty and   values. He says life, marriage, and religious liberty are intertwined and says “you should know them by their fruits. ” Cruz asks the questioner to ask candidates what they have done to protect life, marriage, religious liberty. He calls the Supreme Court’s gay marriage decision “nothing short of tragic” and blasts establishment Republicans for echoing Obama’s talking points about “settled law. ” Cruz says it was a “lawless” and “illegitimate” decision that will not stand because it is inconsistent with the Constitution. Cruz says religious liberty has been a lifelong passion of his and cites his successful defenses of the Pledge of Allegiances, the Ten Commandments. He points out that he also defended the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial Cross and won   in the Supreme Court. 10:20: Cruz says it was “ridiculous” that Donald Trump slammed George W. Bush for not keeping the country safe and defended impeaching George W. Bush. He said Trump had no proof that Bush committed “high crimes and misdemeanors. ” He says it draws into question Trump’s judgment that he supports views associated with Michael Moore and the fever swamps on the left. 10:17: Cruz blasts GOP candidates for being okay with women being drafted to serve. He says the military should not be engaging social experiments or be governed by  “political correctness. ” Cruz says “we will not be drafting our daughters into combat on the front lines” if he is president. He says it makes “no sense. ” Cruz also blasts the Obama administration’s rules of engagement that tie the arms of our servicemen and women behind their backs. 10:12: Cruz thanks the questioner for his service and says Obama doesn’t “believe in the mission of the military” and weakens and degrades them while not standing by our troops. He says veterans across South Carolina have expressed their frustration. He says after Carter weakened the military, Reagan ushered in an economic boom and rebuilt the military to bankrupt the Soviets and win the Cold War. Cruz says he will unleash the American economy to grow the military in order to defeat ISIS. He says getting rid of Assad will be worse for America because ISIS will become even more powerful and Syria will become like Libya. 10:10: Cruz mentions his wife is the daughter of missionaries. He says Heidi (his best friend) will be involved in economic development and educational empowerment issues as First Lady. Cruz says school choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st century and his wife cares about giving minorities more educational opportunities. He admits that he sings to his wife when he calls her and sings “I just called to say I love you. ” 10:06: Cruz smartly punts when he is asked to choose between Clemson and South Carolina. He says he will “shamelessly waffle” and say he “loves them both. ” 10:05: Cruz is worried that Obama will give Guantanamo back to Cuba at the end of his term and undermine America’s national security. He blasts Obama for releasing Guantanamo prisoners American soldiers bled and died to capture. He says they will return to the battlefield in the future to harm Americans. 10:02: Cruz on Obama’s plans to visit Cuba. Cruz says he will not visit Cuba as President so long as the Castros are in power. He blasts Obama’s foreign policy for “alienating and abandoning” our friends. He says no administration has been more “hostile” to Israel than the Obama administration. He says Obama should be pushing for a free Cuba and it is a “mistake” for him to visit. He slams the Obama administration for silencing Cuban dissidents and speaks about how his   were tortured in Cuba. 10:oo: Cruz says Apple should be forced to unlock the phones of the San Bernardino terrorists but not be forced to have backdoor encryption technology in all of their phones. 9:58: Cruz says Trump’s sister is a radical, “ ” judge and slams Trump for suggesting that his sister would be a great Supreme Court Justice. He also slams Trump for giving to Democrats who are very  . He says there is no universe where he could write a check to people like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer. He says anyone who does that does not care about Supreme Court Justices. 9:57: Cruz says Planned Parenthood is the “largest abortionist” in the country and says he doesn’t think Planned Parenthood does “anything wonderful. ” He slams Trump, saying he doesn’t think anyone who is   can say that Planned Parenthood does wonderful things. Cruz does not believe Planned Parenthood should get taxpayer funds. 9:54: Cruz says he “laughed out loud” when he got Trump’s cease and desist letters. He says it pressed the bounds of one of the most   letters he has ever received and points out that Trump has sued people for most of his life. Cruz says Trump’s position is running an ad with Trump’s own words is defamation. Cruz says he wants Trump to file his lawsuit because he wants to depose him. 9:52: Cruz says “it feels fantastic” that the old Reagan coalition is coming together after Cooper mentions that he now beast Trump in the latest   national poll. 9:48: Rubio says he is lucky his wife and kids will love him even if he loses. He says he felt like a cornerback who gave up a big   after New Hampshire but sports has taught him how to deal with setbacks. Rubio says he would like to coach his son’s football team if elected president and says though he worries about his son getting a concussion, there are inherent risks in competitive cheerleading and driving to work. Rubio says he grew up listening to west coast hip hop music but he now like EDM. He says he’s never been to a rave, though (but he jokes that he has the boots for it). 9:44: Rubio says he’s seen Trump smile when Cooper asks about Cruz’s assertion that Rubio is Donald Trump with a smile re: campaign tactics. 9:42: Rubio is asked what he would do to unify the Republican Party and the American people to win the general. Rubio says we are blessed that we solve through elections what other countries solve through civil wars. Rubio says he is being attacked because he is appealing to every voter in the Republican coalition. He vows to grow the GOP if nominated and be a president for all Americans who loves the American people even if they don’t love him back. 9:40: Questioner asks Rubio about     conservatism: Rubio says America must always be a place that allows people seeking refuge from political prosecution and violence to come, but he says Reagan did not have to face a radical Jihadist group that is trying to use America’s immigration laws against the United States. Rubio says ISIS can forge passports and points out that we have to be 100% right on the refugees we admit, which means our vetting process must be stricter than it has ever been. He admits it is nearly impossible to vet Syrian refugees. He says if we don’t know who you are, we’re not going to allow you to come in. Typical    from Rubio. 9:37: Rubio says he wanted to play in the NFL when Cooper asks him if he always wanted to do public service. He says his grandfather, a reader at a cigar shop, instilled in him an interest in   affairs. 9:35: Rubio says he has three educators in his family and he talks bout schools inheriting whatever society sends them in the morning. Rubio says there is no law he can pass to make people become better parents. But he says we need to empower parents and his tax plan increases the   tax credit. He says ultimately, there is not a federal government solution to every problem but leaders should remind people that what happens in your house is more important than what happens in the White House. He says his most important job will always be being a father. He says there should be no laws that discourage marriage or undermine parents. 9:33: Rubio says the Supreme Court can function with eight justices and “this is going to be an issue in the campaign. ” He says the new president will get the opportunity to nominate a Justice. Rubio says he would not nominate a Justice if he were president. 9:27: Rubio says it is not the Fed’s job to stimulate the economy and is not a special Jedi council. Rubio talks about how disruptive today’s economy is and we have to make America a friendlier place in a globally competitive economy (he talks up lowering taxes and eliminating regulations). He warns against America’s debt crisis and speaks about reforms to Social   to balance the budget and leave Social   undisturbed for current beneficiaries. [This is where Rubio’s support of comprehensive amnesty hurts him with   Americans] 9:24: When Cooper asks Rubio if he has felt the sting of racism, he says that his parents were extraordinary people who raised him to believe that there was nothing he could not do. He says in Las Vegas, some older kids were taunting his family about going back to their country on a boat, etc. during the Mariel boat lift. He says his parents never raised him to feel like he was a victim but he doesn’t deny that there are people in this country that have had a different experience. He says “we have some blemishes in our history” that America is still fighting but America, he says, is a nation of “perpetual improvement” an talks about how far America and South Carolina have come since the 1960s. He says a Governor of Indian descent endorsed someone of Cuban descent in South Carolina  …     and they’ll be campaigning with a black Republican in South Carolina tomorrow —  and that says a lot about today’s GOP. 9:20: Questioner asks Rubio how he would address racism while unifying the country. Rubio says the families of the victims of the Charleston massacre had a profound impact on the nation by forgiving the killer. He says race relations, centered around law enforcement, are difficult. He says the overwhelming majority of law enforcement agents are incredible people who risk their lives for our   but he also knows that there are communities in this country where minority   department have terrible relationships. Rubio says there are   males who think they are treated differently and if a significant percentage of the American family believes they are being treated differently, then “we have a problem” and we have to address it as a society and a country. He says there may not be a political solution but there are things we can do to address the issue. He pivots to minority children growing up in broken homes, in dangerous neighborhoods, living substandard housing, and being forced to go to underperforming schools. He says they have four strikes against them and speaks about plans to address those strikes against them. He cites Geoffrey Canada’s work on the issue, 9:18: Female questioner asks Rubio about women in combat. She says that may require the military to lessen standards. Rubio says the military is not where we should lessen standards —  he says he is open to  members of both genders serving so long as they meet common standards. He says plenty of men can’t meet the standard as well and he will not lower standards. 9:16: Rubio says Obama is a failure not because he was a   Senator but because his ideas don’t work (his philosophy is a failed one). Rubio says he has 15 years of experience turning conservative ideas into conservative action. He talks up his eminent domain legislation in Florida that he passed, reducing property taxes, and other educational accomplishments in Florida. [nothing about wanting to dispel the notion that Obama doesn’t know what he is doing] 9:11: A retired General asks Rubio what has prepared him to be the country’s   . Rubio thanks him and all veterans for their service. Rubio says the most important job of being President is being   . He says he knows he hasn’t lived as long as those running for president, but he has more national security experience than anyone running. He claims he has “good judgment” on foreign policy and says he was proven to be right on Libya, ISIS, Syria. He says the hardest vote he has ever taken was his vote not to authorize the use of force in Syria. 9:07: Rubio says he paid off his student loan debt after writing his book. He wants to expand accrediting (alternative accrediting model) talks about his student investment plan (investors can invest in students like they do in  ) speaks about his   loan repayment plans, and his “right to know before  you go” plan (schools have to tell you how much people make while graduating with a degree from that school). Solid answer by Rubio. 9:04: Rubio is asked about Obama’s plans to visit Cuba. Rubio says he will not visit Cuba unless it is a free Cuba. He says the Cuban government is an   Communist dictatorship. He says the Cuban government is repressive and harbors American fugitives (esp. re: medical fraud). 9:01: Rubio says government has to work with Silicon Valley on a way forward to protect the privacy of Americans while ensuring that law enforcement officials can get access to data from   terrorists. Rubio warns against creating a technological backdoor that will allow cybercriminals to steal people’s data. 8:59: Rubio is asked about Obama’s comments about Rubio running away from his Gang of Eight amnesty bill. Rubio says Obama has no standing to talk about immigration after he failed to get it enacted when Democrats controlled Congress. Rubio says the key that unlocks the door to the rest of the issue is securing the border. Rubio says people won’t support a comprehensive approach to immigration and “we have to understand that the only way forward” is a    approach. Rubio again claims he did not think his Senate amnesty bill could not pass and, after that experience, he has learned that no progress will be made on immigration until we build walls, fences on the border and prove to Americans that the border is secure. 8:57: Rubio says he is feeling the “ ” and we’ll find out more on Saturday. Rubio says what Cruz did to Carson in Iowa was “wrong” and insists that Cruz is a liar. He says these things are “disturbing” but are not at the core of his campaign. 8:56: Obama to visit Cuba next month: Just in: @POTUS will visit Cuba next month, sources tell CNN https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 18, 2016,  8:53: Rubio, riding high from his Haley endorsement, is up next. 8:52: Carson says he loves to play pool to relax but he likes to win. He says his wife  learned how to play pool and now is an excellent player. Carson listens to classical music, which he listened to while doing surgeries. 8:50: Carson says he misses what medicine used to be and does not like what it has become. He says doctors today don’t even have time to look at a patient and that is an essential part of medical care that is being lost. 8:49: Cooper asks Carson what goes through his mind on the debate stage. Carson says he is thinking if anyone remembers what happened in 2012, when Republicans tore each other apart and allowed Obama to win. Carson says he would relish running against either Clinton or Sanders. 8:47: Questioner says she appreciates Carson’s   nature but worries that Carson will not be able to get his message out in the general election against a boisterous Democrat. Carson says that as a pediatric neurosurgeon, he got people’s attention by speaking softly. He says the key is not so much the volume but the content of what y0u say. He says that is what is going to make the difference. He says Americans will be smart enough to understand the difference between   and the truth. He says it will be easy to counter Sanders’s message of “free college for everyone. ” Carson quotes Thatcher —  “Socialism is great until  you run out of other people’s money. ” 8:44: Carson is asked about China’s corporate espionage. Carson says “we are being hit thousands of times a day” by cyberattacks from China and other places. Carson says that is why he has advocated for a “comprehensive solution” for cybersecurity that involves   partnership where there can be a common place where attacks can be reported. Carson says he would not be reluctant to go on the offensive in cyberspace. Carson says he is nice but he also wants to protect Americans. 8:41: A Clemson student asks Carson about criminal justice reform. Carson says that America has 5% of the world’s population and 25% of the world’s inmates, which means something is “askew. ” Carson says we send   criminals to the university where they become violent criminals. Carson says if prisoners are going to be reintegrated into society, we have to think about offering them practical training, etc. He says he would take another look at mandatory minimum sentencing, etc. Carson warns against putting mentally unstable people with violent inmates and then releasing them into society after their prison term. 8:35: Would Carson be open to serving as Surgeon General or head of the Department of Health and Human Services? Carson says after 15, 000 operations, he definitely not just looking for a job. He says our country is on the precipice and is about to go over the edge. He says we will go over that edge if we continue with politics as usual. He says we can’t tinker around the edges and get America’s economic engine rolling again. Carson says we are starting to lose sight of who we are because we are giving away our identity and values for the sake of political correctness. He says he has a vision that he thinks he shares with “we the people. ” He says it would be difficult for him to serve in an administration that didn’t have the same vision. 8:33: Questioner asks Carson what his “big idea” would be if he is elected president. Carson says he has “multiple big ideas” and says that we have only 330 million people while China has 1. 4 billion people and India has 1. 1. billion. He says we have to compete with them on the world’s stage and can’t afford to waste any of our people. He says we can’t have so many Americans dropping out of high school and have 25% of the world’s inmates. He says for every one of the young people we can keep from going down the path of   that is one more person we don’t have to be   for, etc. His “big idea” would be not throwing away any of our people. 8:30: An undecided voter who works in the defense industry asks Carson about guns. He says he has just recently felt the need to own a gun and asks what his plan is to protect the American people and preserve his right to own a gun. He says the 2nd Amendment is there so people can assist the government in case of an invasion and people can protect themselves in case the government became tyrannical and tried to rule the people. He says we’ve had guns for hundreds of years and been free for hundreds of years and “I think there may be a correlation there. ” He says politicians should be offering free gun lessons after terrorist attacks instead of trying to take them away. Carson says he has “multiple marksmanship awards” from ROTC and owns guns. He says he doesn’t  know if he has ever felt the need to have a gun but he likes having a gun. 8:27: Carson says he is more than qualified to handle the country’s national security. He says our system was designed for citizens and he says he has had more 2 am phone calls where he had to make life or death decisions than anybody. Carson says we need people who know how to solve problems and not people who can talk. Carson speaks about all of the innovation he has been responsible for at Johns Hopkins and the scholarship fund he has started. He says he has spent 18 years on Kellogg’s boar and 16 years on Costco’s. He mentions that a lot of politicians lack the experience he has had. Town hall format is good for Carson unlike the debates, where he gets  . 8:26: At Trump’s town hall event: Why does Donald Trump keep attacking Jeb Bush? At MSNBC town hall, he says:”Because he’s sort of easy to hit, to be honest with you.”  —   Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) February 18, 2016,  8:25: First questioner asks Carson how he would reconcile Christian values with the current GOP’s position on social issues, welfare. This is a Republican town hall event? Seriously? Carson says it is not the government’s job to take care of everybody, take care of poverty, etc. He blasts the “War on Poverty” for creating more poverty, leading to more broken home and incarceration. He says he wishes the government would read the Constitution and says maybe they read the preamble (general welfare clause) and thought it meant putting everybody on welfare. Carson talks about    births and says the education of the mother stops when they have the baby  …    . he says we should encourage mothers to go back to school and become independent to break the cycle of dependency. He says having people dependent on government is not compassionate. 8:24: Carson says a potential Justice’s life would be his litmus test. 8:23: Carson says he would nominate a Supreme Court Justice if he were president but that does not mean the Senate has to confirm his choice. He blasts the partisanship of the nominating process. 8:22: Carson says Apple has good reason not to trust the government “but we’re going to have to get over that” because radical Jihadists “want to destroy us. ” He says there needs to be a   partnership when it comes to   because “we’re all at risk in a very significant way. ” He says Apple needs to sit down with trustworthy members of the government —  he says they may have to wait until the next president —  and hammer out an agreement. 8:20: Carson says brain surgery is a lot  harder than politics. He says it’s been wonderful to meet so many people across the country and hear their concerns but it hasn’t been great dealing with the press. 8:07: Scalia commits that he won’t appoint anyone to the Supreme Court if they do not agree with Scalia on Heller. 8:05: Trump says that he has never done well in the WSJ poll  —   he says someone over there must not like him. He says he is “honored” by most of the poll results that  have him ahead.  Trump says he has had “great success” with lawsuits. He says he doesn’t know if he is going to have a lawsuit but he needs to keep people honest. 8:04: Interesting observation: Every rally ppl rush to get    signed.

Carson, Cruz and Rubio will start in five minutes. MSNBC will air Trump’s town hall event, which was recorded earlier, in the same time slot. 7:17: In an interview with Chris Matthews, Kasich can’t envision Trump being president. He says debates are a ridiculous way to pick a president. 7:15: From Swoyer in South Carolina: Roughly   thousand in Sumter, SC on Wednesday night to see Donald Trump: (Photo: Alex   News) Video here: Trump in Sumter, SC, 7:00: Must have occurred before Haley endorsed Rubio: Watch Jeb and George W.

He said there’s a lot of interest going around and a “frightening number of people like Donald Trump,” and he is in the camp of anybody who can catch Trump. 6:55: Rubio speaks to some supporters in Spanish, and he tells them that he has to get to CNN’s GOP forum un Greenville. A University of South Carolina students tells   he is going to vote for Rubio over Bush. 6:50: Jeb! supporters want Bush to be more of a “   ” like Dubya: [Tony Lee: I think Jeb! ’s biggest mistake in the election cycle was going on the ridiculous Paleo diet (not deciding to wear glasses) which has been known to make people “low energy. ” Maybe his advisers wanted him to look more metro, but a heftier Jeb Bush actually seems more   and stronger, and it may have been tougher for Trump to dismiss him as a weak and effeminate loser who embodied many of the traits that Americans hate about those in the professional   class in D.

Points out that our rights come from God and not from government. Rubio says we have to win the “future” in addition to the election. He says there’s an opportunity to grow the conservative movement. He says it is a lie that Democrats are the party of the   while Republicans are for rich people. He mentions that his mom was a maid and says Republicans need to be the party of maids, cab drivers, single mothers, young people, etc. Rubio calls on Americans to be the authors of what will be the greatest chapter in America’s history. Haley says “this is one of the many bruises” she’ll take for Rubio and asks the crowd to go to the polls in record numbers for Rubio. She urges the crowd to take photos of them and spread them on social media platforms like Instagram. [But   donors on the left and right covet the comprehensive amnesty bill that Rubio championed. Will be a tough sell to working Americans.] 6:25: Scene at Rubio’s rally with Haley: Gov. Nikki Haley has endorsed Marco Rubio. pic. twitter.   —   Robert Kittle (@RobertKittle) February 17, 2016,  6:20: Another South Carolina poll has Trump on top: Breaking: Latest #SouthCarolina Poll Results:Donald Trump: 33%Ted Cruz: 20%Marco Rubio: 19%Jeb Bush: 9%John Kasich: 9%Ben Carson: 5%  —   ECPS (@EmersonPolling) February 17, 2016,  6:12: Rubio says the first words his father learned in English were “I’m looking for work. ” He says less than ten years after his parents came to the United States with nothing, they owned a home in a  safe neighborhood and lived to see their children do better than they did. Rubio says that’s Haley’s story and everyone else’s story in America. Rubio says the “vast majority” have a story like that —  of parents who gave up everything so they could have a life they never had. Rubio says if we stay on the road we are on now, “we are going to be the first Americans that leave their children worse off  …    ” Rubio mocks Sanders for being a Socialist. He blasts Hillary Clinton for being unqualified to be president because she put intelligence information on her server because she thinks she’s above the law and disqualified for lying to the families of the Benghazi victims. Rubio says Scalia understood the Constitution is not a   document and Obama will not be able to replace Antonin Scalia. Rubio says America needs to do what South Carolina is doing in attracting companies like Boeing and BMW and says the election is also about free enterprise, which can make poor people richer without making rich people poorer. [Good line]. Rubio says he will rebuild the U. S. military if he is elected president. He asks veterans to raise their hands so we can thank you for your service. He says what we are doing to our veterans today is “immoral” and says nobody will be fired after calls to the VA’s suicide hotline went to voicemail. 6:10: Rubio says he and his family have spent a lot of time in South Carolina as tourists on their drives to Washington. He says he has learned not to pick sides between South Carolina and Clemson. Rubio says last year the country learned why South Carolina is an inspiration for all. Rubio says the nation was inspired and moved when the victims of the Charleston tragedy forgave the killer. 6:08: Haley says she wants to share a “personal story. ” She says she is “always trying to take care of South Carolina” and she felt vulnerable for the first time last year and “the people of South Carolina made us all strong. ”  Haley says the presidential race is “serious” and thought first and foremost as a mom who wants her children to be safe while getting educational opportunities. She wanted someone, as a military wife, who will get the backs of the military and veterans. She says she wants a President who wants to stop the federal mandates like Obamacare and the EPA. She adds that she wants a President who understands they have to being a “conscience” back to our Republicans. Haley says Rubio is all about “term limits. ” She says we have “good people in this race” but her job was to find the person who could do it the best. She says she wanted someone with fight, passion, and conviction to do the right thing but humble enough to remember that politicians work for all the people. She also wanted someone who could show her parents that the best decision they made was to come to America. [Haley’s endorsement is a bit robotic and formulaic. No personal   that make the endorsement more personal. Seems transactional.] 6:05: Shaw gets ready to introduce Haley as Haley and Rubio appear at the rally on the Marco Rubio buss. 6:00: At a Rubio campaign rally, former South Carolina quarterback Connor Shaw says Rubio is a “man of faith” at a time when “this country desperately needs it. ” Shaw led many a comeback while he was Spurrier’s   but Trump’s lead over Rubio seems insurmountable at this point. 5:45: Bloomberg Poll: Trump Still Has Commanding Lead in South Carolina: Donald Trump holds a   lead over Ted Cruz among those likely to vote in Saturday’s South Carolina Republican primary, with Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush locked in a close race for third and John Kasich showing no signs of a surge. 5:30: Rubio’s team wants Cruz to apologize to Rep. Trey Gowdy ( ). Rubio communications director Alex Conant: “Senator Cruz owes Trey Gowdy an apology. We can have honest policy disagreements, but instead Cruz campaign officials go on national TV and slander Trey Gowdy. To be clear: The Cruz campaign’s insults and accusations are nothing compared to the cases Trey Gowdy took on as a federal prosecutor. Today’s actions by Senator Cruz and those who speak for him are indicative of a campaign spiraling    in an    to win at any costs, even if it means sacrificing the Senator’s integrity in the process. Voters will reject Senator Cruz’s campaign of personal insults, deceptions, push polls, and ads so misleading they can’t be aired. ” 5:25: Trump to South Carolinians: Tell Gov. Haley You Don’t Want Syrian Refugees. Trump says South Carolina has “a lot” of refugees and “you oughta tell your governor, ‘don’t let ’em move to South Carolina. You don’t want ’em in South Carolina. ’” Trump says “we don’t know where they come from” and Gulf States should do more to fund refugee programs. 5:21: Trump’s message for Jeb!

In the poll, Cruz is the first choice of 28 percent of Republican primary voters, while Trump gets 26 percent.

Kristol predicted that Trump would run behind Ron Paul’s 2012 campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire.

After speaking to two boisterous campaign rallies in the state Monday, Sanders made an unannounced visit at the Detroit home of Virgie Rollins, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee’s black caucus. Michigan holds its primary on March 8, a week after Super Tuesday. 4:28: Matt Moore, the Chairman of the South Carolina GOP, says on MSNBC that Haley’s endorsement “could change the race” in South Carolina.

The audience of   activists and other Vermonters of color should have been a friendly one for the socialist congressman. Instead, remembers Curtiss Reed Jr. the executive director of the group, it became something of a showdown.

It is also worth nothing that Haley, who had been mired in middle of the pack for much of her 2010 gubernatorial primary campaign, would never have won the primary and the general election had it not been for Sarah Palin’s endorsement. In fact, it can be argued that a lot of the bad blood between the professional conservatives and the grassroots started in 2010 when the professional D. C. conservatives realized how little influence they actually had compared to politicians like Palin who resonated with conservative voters. 2:37 pm: Tony Lee: After her   response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address, Haley came under considerable fire, especially for her comments about resisting the “siren call” of the angriest voices. While defending her State of the Union response, Haley said she had “disagreements with other presidential candidates” and mentioned that “Marco Rubio believes in amnesty, which I don’t. There’s lots of things. ” Haley later walked back those remarks, saying that “it’s been a long couple of days. What I said was that I didn’t agree with him. I meant what I didn’t agree with him was on the Gang of Eight bill. I said that he wasn’t for amnesty. That’s not what I meant.

Channeling Andrew Jackson” What Mr. Trump borrows from Jackson is not an issue, but a way of thinking about the world. Mr. Trump promises to fix his supporters’ problems, no matter who else is hurt. He’s a wealthy celebrity always ready for a fight, a superpatriot who says he will make America great again. He vows to attack government corruption and defend the common man. All this could be said of Jackson.   …     Jackson had a captivating style, and not just because of his wild hair. He did what he wanted, and demanded respect. In an 1806 duel, he shot and killed a man who had insulted him in a newspaper. Mr. Trump’s Twitter broadsides at his critics are gentle by comparison. Like Mr. Trump, Jackson made his fortune in real estate. He bought and sold vast tracts of Southern land in concert with wealthy friends. If desirable land was owned by Indians, Jackson bullied or bribed them into selling it cheap.   8:22 am  —   Trump overnight   targets Obama, Megyn Kelly,  —   Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I “would never be president”  —   This from perhaps the worst president in U.

She said her family would have never been able to keep their farm “if it wasn’t for Trump’s kind heart. ” “He cares about farmers and veterans. He truly wants to make America great again and if we help him, we can get there,” she told the crowd. “So I want y’all to know that. ” Read more about it here: One narrative emerging around the surprisingly resilient Donald Trump portrays the brash billionaire as a final card laid down by Republican   voters who see their way of life  —   and their political clout  —   draining away in a bathtub spiral. Trump has been a man of last resort before. Right here in Georgia, in fact. And if his Republican presidential machine doesn’t seize upon the tale in the next few weeks, as he and U. S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas battle for Southern votes, then someone in the Trump campaign will be guilty of gross incompetence. [  …    ] On Feb. 4, Lenard Dozier Hill III, a   occupant of his    acreage, was about to have his land sold out from under him. ”That morning, it was going to be auctioned off at the courthouse steps, so he committed suicide,” said Betsy Sharp, his daughter. In the bedroom of the Hill home, along with the .  rifle that did the work, was a neat stack of life insurance policies and other papers on the nightstand. Hill had intended for the life insurance payout to cover most of his $300, 000 debt and so save the family farm for another generation. It was a grievous miscalculation. Most, if not all, life insurance policies include a clause that prohibits payment in cases of suicide. “He didn’t realize all that,” Sharp said. Hill’s desperate act struck a chord. Reporters and TV crews descended on the Waynesboro church where the funeral was held. Vandals painted “farmer killer” on the door of the local bank. Once the family realized the financial futility of Hill’s suicide, the burden of saving the farm fell on his widow, Annabel Hill, a    teacher and social worker with gray hair and large glasses. [  …    ] Trump told the Atlanta businessman that his wife, Ivana, had seen the report on the Hill family’s plight on the network news, and she suggested that he get involved. The magnate summoned Argenbright and the Hills to New York. After a brief interview, Trump signed onto the cause. [  …    ] The Annabel Hill episode was just a small piece of the farm crisis. In the two months that followed, 85 other farms in Burke County alone were scheduled for foreclosure. Other celebrities attempted rescues as well  —   Willie Nelson’s series of Farm Aid concerts had begun the year before. But this was the moment that Donald Trump, who had already put his name on the New York City skyline, introduced himself to rural America. 10:40  —   Tony Lee: Per NBC News, Bush and Rubio helping GOP consultants send their kids to expensive colleges.

Sanders is drawing a lot of young people to his rallies, but it doesn’t seem like he can connect enough with black voters to get the overwhelming support he needs to knock off Clinton, who will get many votes by default because she isn’t fumbling the ball while appealing to black voters even though she is way too much prose on the stump. Soulful poetry is something that Clinton doesn’t know how to do on the campaign trail, but she has enough talking points and the support of black establishment leaders to run out the clock unless Sanders can up his game really quickly in the next couple of weeks.

Ted Cruz of using “dishonest  ” to attack their candidate, releasing a   of their own to “alert” voters in South Carolina to the supposed effort. The Cruz campaign said “it is the height of hypocrisy for the Rubio campaign to put out a robocall that lies to South Carolina voters and then falsely accuse the Cruz campaign of the same thing  …     Obviously Rubio would rather spend time and money running negative robocalls than talking about his record. Perhaps it’s because if voters knew Rubio still supports amnesty, skipped votes on defense spending and defunding Planned Parenthood, and voted for John Kerry to be Secretary of State, they’d prefer someone who’s a consistent conservative like Ted Cruz. ” 7:50  —   Tony Lee: Sen. Cory Booker ( ) insists Trump will not be president. I wonder if Booker thinks he could have won the Democratic nomination had he run: “I’ve been wrong on everything about Trump, I’ve been wrong about everything on the Republican side of the ledger,” he continued. “But allow me  —   with that caveat  —   to made the prediction that Donald Trump will not be the president of the United States.

He isn’t back because he was so brilliant last Saturday night, wielding some sort of rapier wit or intellectual superiority or a plethora of ideas. The New York Times, which hasn’t had much of a Rubio crush, save for a small   lapse, found him lackluster. No. He’s back because the media desperately need him to come back to save the Republic from Trump and Cruz. The media, who are usually just content to stir up some trouble so that they can cover it, have got a horse in this race, and they are going to keep whipping him to the finish line, even after he stumbles. It’s enough to give you whiplash. 7:18  —   Tony Lee: Trump blasts Obama for not even saying “radical Islamic terrorism. ” Trump again defends his temporary ban on Muslims in South Carolina. “Just take a look at Europe  …     with the tremendous crime rate, the tremendous problems,” he says. Trump mocks claims that only 10% of refugees will cause problems and points out that just two people in San Bernardino terrorized a community in the terror attacks. “If I get in, they’re going back,” he says of the Muslim refugees. “They’re going back. ” 7:15  —   Tony Lee: Even the Huffington Post mocks the   media outlets on the right and the mainstream media reporters who rely on Rubio aides as background sources for insisting that a “Rubio surge” is just around the corner. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio hasn’t won a Republican presidential primary yet, but his press team has done an incredible job of convincing the media he will do so any day now.

When asked who he would be voting for in November’s election, the director, speaking at the Berlin film festival press conference for his new film,   recalled a fundraiser he once threw for Bill Clinton. Accompanying the president at the time was an aide with a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist. Lee believed that this was the “nuclear football” which allows the US president to authorise a nuclear attack while away from the White House. “I always thought it was a myth.

Whether it’s President Obama’s illegal executive amnesty, Obamacare, or massive deficit spending, we can count on Ted to start making positive reforms his first day in office. He is not one of those ‘campaign conservatives’ who are all talk  —   he is a proven, principled conservative. ” “I am thrilled to have the support of Congressman Huelskamp,” said Cruz. “He is a man that has stood up to the Washington Cartel and fought for conservative principles. Tim has been a stalwart leader in the House of Representatives on issues that matter most for conservatives. From life, to fighting to repeal Obamacare, I know I can count on Tim’s conservative, principled leadership. ” 6:53  —   Tony Lee: Trump says politicians are “bad news” and what the Cruz campaign did to Carson in Iowa was one of the “most despicable things” he has ever seen. 6:50  —   Tony Lee: Thomas Sowell endorses Cruz:  Senator Ted Cruz has been criticized in this column before, and will undoubtedly be criticized here again. But we can only make our choices among those actually available, and Senator Cruz is the one who comes to mind when depth and steadfastness come to mind. As someone who once clerked for a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, he will know how important choosing Justice Scalia’s replacement will be. And he has the intellect to understand much more. 6:42  —   Tony Lee: Trump references Nikki Haley’s speech about resisting the siren call of the angriest voices. Trump says he and his supporters are not “angry people” but just “angry” at the stupidity of Washington. Trump says he is not going to say he is “thrilled” at the way the country is going and is “angry” that the country is $19 trillion in debt. He says he is also “angry” at Republicans for funding Obama’s executive amnesty and refugee program. “It’s going to be a whole different story [if I win the White House],” Trump says. 6:40  —   Tony Lee: Trump again says refugees may be the “ultimate Trojan horse” and there must be safe zones in the Middle East. “We cannot let these people come in under any circumstances. It can’t happen. We have to have a strong country again. We have to be vigilant. ” Trump says Europe is a “disaster. ” 6:38  —   Tony Lee: While GOP candidates fight in South Carolina, Kasich is eyeing Michigan: While Michigan might seem a receptive state for Mr. Kasich’s moderate message, Mitt Romney, who was also courting the centrist vote and whose father had been Michigan’s governor, won only a narrow victory over the more conservative Rick Santorum in the state’s 2012 primary. Mr. Romney had criticized Mr. Santorum for trying to recruit Democrats to vote for him Michigan allows voters to cast ballots in either primary.. Much of the challenge facing Mr. Kasich is raising his profile, especially because he has not thrived during televised debates. That challenge exists in Michigan just as it does in the rest of the country. 6:35  —   Tony Lee: Trump blasts Hillary for barking like a dog: “A joke. ” 6:32  —   Tony Lee: Trump: Under Obama, ‘Our Borders Are Like Swiss Cheese’ In South Carolina, Trump blasts Obama and says under Obama, “our borders are like Swiss cheese. ” Trump says he is taking Obama’s comments about how Trump will never become president “as a great compliment. ” 6:3o  —   Tony Lee: Frenchman Thomas Piketty (author of Capital in the 21st Century) gushes over Bernie’s candidacy: Sanders makes clear he wants to restore progressive taxation and a higher minimum wage ($15 an hour). To this he adds free healthcare and higher education in a country where inequality in access to education has reached unprecedented heights, highlighting a gulf standing between the lives of most Americans, and the soothing meritocratic speeches pronounced by the winners of the system. Meanwhile, the Republican party sinks into a     and   discourse (even though Islam isn’t a great religious force in the country) and a limitless glorification of the fortune amassed by rich white people. The judges appointed under Reagan and Bush have lifted any legal limitation on the influence of private money in politics, which greatly complicates the task of candidates like Sanders. However, new forms of political mobilization and crowdfunding can prevail and push America into a new political cycle. We are far from gloomy prophecies about the end of history. 6:20  —   Tony Lee: Ted Cruz releases a web video attacking Trump as a candidate who can’t be trusted to protect the right to life. 6:18  —   Tony Lee: Sanders says Clinton’s comparison of Sanders’s supporters to the Tea Party is “silly. ” “There’s no comparison. ” 6:15  —   Tony Lee: Donald Trump introduced Red Sox pitcher Clay Buchholz to his future wife (model Lindsay Clubine) and the Boston hurler is now a big supporter of Trump’s presidential bid: Buchholz has become a big supporter of Trump’s presidential campaign, “Every time we’re in New York, we walk over to Trump Tower and see him if he’s around,” he said. Asked if he supported Trump for president, Buchholz gave an enthusiastic, “Absolutely!” “He says what a lot of people think and don’t say,” Buchholz said. “I like that part of him. “I’m not really into politics, but I’m watching a lot more now. He’s been awesome to me. He says what’s on his mind, which is why he’s accomplished so much in his life. “I always found him to be a   person.

A   sniper and highly skilled Marine infantryman, Sgt. Meyer deployed twice to combat duty. On September 8, 2009, during a   firefight, without regard for his own personal safety, Sgt. Meyer repeatedly braved enemy fire in Afghanistan to find and save fellow members of his team. Wounded by shrapnel, Sgt. Meyer entered the kill zone numerous times to evacuate his fellow Marines and soldiers along with the Afghan soldiers. ” “This election is a turning point for our country,” said Meyer. “In these dangerous times we need a strong, principled conservative in the White House. We need a    who works with our allies and makes it known that certain actions against the United States and its allies will not be tolerated. I am confident that Ted Cruz has the ability and resolve to be   . His record of standing up and fighting for what he believes in shows that he is not someone who buckles under pressure. Ted is ready to led this country  —   and I look forward to help uniting conservatives and veterans behind this campaign. ” “Dakota is a man of great courage and principle,” said Cruz. “He has served our country dutifully and honorably as a Sergeant in the Marines. Dakota understands the extreme impact this election has on the future of this country. We need to restore America’s leadership in the world at a time when Obama’s foreign policy has put America and it’s national security interests in jeopardy. I am honored to have Dakota’s support and have him as part of our team to help win the White House in 2016. ” 6:00  —   Tony Lee: Oh, Canada: The Best Campaign Operatives money can buy, folks. Via the Vancouver Sun:  Marco Rubio, currently running third in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, must be hoping that scenic Vancouver can give him a push past frontrunners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. The Florida senator’s latest campaign ad, titled Morning Again in America, opens with three seconds of beautiful stock footage featuring our skyline and harbour. “It’s morning again in America,” says the narrator as a tugboat zips through the water in front of familiar Vancouver landmarks like the Harbour Centre, One Wall Centre and Port Metro Vancouver cranes. It’s unmistakably Vancouver. [It’s been funny watching all of the crony GOP consultants defending and hyping up Rubio like their  livelihoods and cronyism depend on it. ] 5:55  —   Tony Lee: Much has been made of Hillary Clinton’s supposed “firewall” re: black voters, but Clinton may be losing faith in her “Latino Firewall” in Nevada: What’s going on here? There’s a short answer and a long answer. The short answer is that the Clinton campaign isn’t as confident that the state is “Hillary country” as it once was, and is trying to get its supporters to lower their expectations in advance by making it sound like New Hampshire. But the longer answer is that it’s worth taking these concerns somewhat seriously: Clinton staffers aren’t the only people in Nevada who think Latinos will punch below their weight on Saturday and might even make up a smaller share of the caucuses than they did in 2008. That’s not good for Nevada’s claim as the first diverse state to hold a Democratic nominating contest. And it might even force the state to lose its   status entirely  —   further diminishing the influence of the Latino vote on Democratic primaries. 5:40  —   Tony Lee: Obama says he knows “Hillary better than I know Bernie” because she served in his administration and was an “outstanding Secretary of State. ” He says “Bernie and Hillary agree on a lot of stuff. ” Obama was asked about Sanders’s past criticisms of him at a Rancho Mirage, California press conference. He said Hillary may agree with him more on certain issues while Sanders may agree more with on others. Obama said he wants “this primary” process to play itself out but may ultimately have an opinion on the race. 5:35  —   Tony Lee: President Obama says he doesn’t “believe that Mr. Trump will be President” because “I have a lot of faith in the American people. ” But Obama doesn’t say that Trump will not win the nomination. 5:10  —   Tony Lee: Jeb!

Clinton says Republicans think Obama should not be able to nominate Scalia’s replacement “as if somehow he is not the real president. ” She says Republicans talk in “coded racial language” about “takers and losers” and “demonize” president Obama.

Clinton defends Obama’s legacy and says he is an example of the progress blacks have made. But she says “America’s long struggle with race is far from finished. ” She says it is “tempting” for many white Americans to think that “bigotry is largely behind us” because “that would lead us with a lot less work, wouldn’t it?” Clinton repeats her   line about years after Rosa Parks sat, Dr. King marched, and John Lewis bled, “race still plays a significant role in determining in who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind. ” She says anyone asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with this reality. She hypes “empowerment zones” and the Earned Income Tax Credit but is so far silent on her husband’s legacy re: criminal justice that compelled influential author Michelle Alexander to obliterate the Clintons and argue that Clinton doesn’t deserve the black vote. [Clinton is just trying to run out the clock with black voters in the primary, but the general election may be another story] 4:16  —   Tony Lee: Clinton says there is “something wrong” when white CEOs get away with “fleecing the country” while blacks get arrested for petty crimes. 4:15  —   Tony Lee: Meanwhile, Sanders supporters tell rapper Killer Mike, who has endorsed Sanders, why they support Bernie. 4:14  —   Tony Lee: Hillary intends to succeed in raising taxes on every millionaire and billionaire in America. 4:12  —   Tony Lee: Clinton says she there are so many barriers holding back  . And she wants to talk about breaking down barriers that “disproportionately affect  ” and “build ladders of opportunity. ” She says there are “many Flints” in America where people of color and the poor have been left behind. She says while Democrats are debating about Wall Street’s excesses, “Flint reminds us, my friends, that there’s a lot more going on in the country that we should be concerned about. ” She says America isn’t a “  country. ” Again, this speech is way too    when it needs to be much more poetry. What else is new? 4:10  —   Tony Lee: Clinton says that any view of black America that focuses exclusively on crime, poverty or other challenges is “missing so much  …     missing the strength, pride, and achievement that is evident on every street here. ” Clinton says that narrative is missing the rise of the   middle class and the vibrancy of the black church. Again, Clinton seems like she is reading from a briefing   paper. Hillary says she has a great conversation earlier with various black leaders. 4:05  —   Tony Lee: When introducing Clinton, Rep. Charlie Rangel ( ) seemed to say Hillary “Rodman Clinton” when introducing Hillary Rodham Clinton. 4:00 PM  —   Tony Lee: While Hillary Clinton was meeting with Sharpton and Morial, Erica Garner (the late Eric Garner’s daughter) introduced Bernie Sanders at a South Carolina campaign event. Erica Garner endorsed Sanders last week with a video that was highly touted on the left in which she said Sanders is a “protester” like Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. In interviews with various local and national outlets, Garner said Sanders, who also endorsed Jesse Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign, supported blacks before it was cool to do so.</td>\n",

       "        <td>MANILA  —   On Thanksgiving Day, a Philippine developer named Jose E. B. Antonio hosted a company anniversary bash at one of Manila’s poshest hotels. He had much to be thankful for. In October, he had quietly been named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte. Mr. Antonio was nearly finished building a $150 million tower in Manila’s financial district  —   a   symbol of affluence and capitalism, which bluntly promotes itself with the slogan “Live Above the Rest. ” And now his partner on the project, Donald J. Trump, had just been elected president of the United States. After the election, Mr. Antonio flew to New York for a private meeting at Trump Tower with the  ’s children, who have been involved in the Manila project from the beginning, as have Mr. Antonio’s children. The Trumps and Antonios have other ventures in the works, including   resorts in the Philippines, Mr. Antonio’s son Robbie Antonio said. “We will continue to give you products that you can enjoy and be proud of,” the elder Mr. Antonio, one of the richest men in the Philippines, told the 500 friends, employees and customers gathered for his   celebration in Manila. Mr. Antonio’s combination of jobs  —   he is a business partner with Mr. Trump, while also representing the Philippines in its relationship with the United States and the    —   is hardly inconsequential, given some of the weighty issues on the diplomatic table. Among them, Mr. Duterte has urged “a separation” from the United States and has called for American troops to exit the country in two years’ time. His antidrug crusade has resulted in the summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial, prompting criticism from the Obama administration. Situations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America’s reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family’s financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite. “It is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,” said Michael J. Green, who served on the National Security Council in the administration of George W. Bush, and before that at the Defense Department. The globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. Trump’s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What’s more, the true extent of Mr. Trump’s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders. In an interview with The Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump boasted again about the global reach of his business  —   and his family’s ability to keep it running after he takes office. “I’ve built a very great company and it’s a big company and it’s all over the world,” Mr. Trump said, adding later: “I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it. ” In a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings. “Vetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both   Trump, his adult children and his executives,” she said. But a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies. In Brazil, for example, the beachfront Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro  —   one of Mr. Trump’s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake  —   is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project. Several of Mr. Trump’s real estate ventures in India  —   where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America  —   are being built through companies with family ties to India’s most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Mr. Trump’s projects, including pressuring   banks to extend favorable loans. In Ireland and Scotland, executives from Mr. Trump’s golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the Trump Organization’s plans to build a   sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail’s habitat  —   a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States. And in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. Trump’s name be removed from Trump Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Mr. Trump came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan  —   suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup  —   the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. Trump’s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests. Mr. Trump has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. “I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,” he said during a radio interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist. “It’s a tremendously successful job. It’s called Trump Towers  —   two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It’s two. ” These tangled ties already have some members of Congress  —   including at least one Republican representative  —   calling on Mr. Trump to provide more information on his international operations, or perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them. “You rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,” Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said in a Twitter message on Monday. “If you have contracts   govts, it’s certainly a big deal, too. #DrainTheSwamp” David J. Kramer, who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump’s financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency  —   and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad. “This will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,” Mr. Kramer said. Even if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president’s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials. “The working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,” said Michael H. Fuchs, who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. “They will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world. ” At the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump’s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies. Another question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president? What is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Mr. Trump’s business interests and his transition effort, with the   or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Mr. Trump raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who is in charge of planning and development of the Trump Organization’s global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders  —   of Turkey, Argentina and Japan  —   having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide. Mr. Trump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team. Federal law does not prevent Mr. Trump from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially the president is exempt from most    laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the emoluments clause, appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in Trump Tower in New York to the Bank of China or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels. “I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O. K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can’t help that, but I don’t care,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “The only thing that matters to me is running our country. ”  Robert D. Blackwill, a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in. “Let’s listen and not prejudge,” said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. “I want to see what he does as president. ” Nation Under Pressure, Ventures Under Scrutiny Donald Trump Jr. the  ’s oldest son, gushed with triumphalism when he announced a deal in 2014 to attach the family name to the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, a lavish   beachfront project featuring cavernous suites with private plunge pools and a    nightclub. “This is an exciting time to develop our first project in South America and the perfect location to do so,” the younger Mr. Trump (his brother Eric is also involved in the family business) said at the time. But just two years later, the venture is embroiled in a criminal investigation in Brazil, pointing to unfulfilled promises that are casting a pall over both the Trump business empire and the   in their dealings in Latin America’s largest country. Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a crusading federal prosecutor in the capital, Brasília, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio. The Trump hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds  —   Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a   information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins State  —   put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Mr. Trump’s Brazilian partner, LSH Barra. Back in 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil’s energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries. But Brazil’s economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades. The hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where   were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic. The examination of the project by Mr. Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has already found a series of “highly suspicious” potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. “It is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the Trump Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,” Mr. Lopes said in documents filed in October. In his filings, Mr. Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Mr. Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large   banks and energy companies. Mr. Trump first took interest in a Rio hotel venture in 2012, when Ivanka Trump was having lunch in Florida with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a businessman who is a grandson of João Figueiredo, the last autocrat of Brazil’s   military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. The younger Mr. Figueiredo spearheaded the hotel venture until recently. In a statement, Mr. Trump’s Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry. Alan Garten, the Trump Organization’s general counsel, said in a statement issued Friday that the investigation was not targeting Mr. Trump or his company  —   given that it does not own the hotel  —   and “has no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry. ” The investigation of the Trump projects is unfolding at an awkward time for the Brazilian authorities. Foreign Minister José Serra, Brazil’s top diplomat, publicly declared in July that a Trump presidency would be a “nightmare. ” Although President Temer has formally congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory in a letter, he is still among world leaders who have not yet spoken by telephone with the  . Even if Brazil’s executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Mr. Trump, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent. “Brazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the Trump administration, but that’s about all they can do,” said Maurício Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “This is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years. ” Potential Pitfalls in Dual Roles On the other side of the world, Donald Trump Jr. had other projects he was pushing. In 2012, he flew into Mumbai for a brief meeting with the state’s chief minister at that time, hoping to salvage a residential tower representing the Trump Organization’s first planned project there. He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed. The participants recall the meeting differently: Mr. Trump’s partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Mr. Chavan could formalize a policy so that the project could continue. Mr. Chavan said that in a   meeting, Mr. Trump and his partner were “requesting a concession that could not be given. ” By the end of the meeting, in any case, it was fairly clear that the younger Mr. Trump’s presence had not worked any magic. The project was shelved soon after. “He thought the name was so big, we would bend backwards to satisfy him, but that was not the case,” Mr. Chavan said. Kalpesh Mehta, managing partner of Tribeca Developers of Mumbai, the Trump Organization’s development partner in India, confirmed that Donald Trump Jr. had met with the chief minister, but disputed the claim by Mr. Chavan that he had sought a special favor. “The notion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false,” Mr. Mehta said in the statement, which was issued Friday. “The Trump Organization does not get involved in the regulatory aspects   interacting with government officials related to its projects in India. ” This example, analysts here say, points to a potentially serious ethical hazard for a United States president who is also a real estate mogul in India, with five projects underway. Mr. Trump was operating much like other developers in India, who cozy up to politicians  —   officially or unofficially  —   to push projects through the bureaucracy. Often, they must obtain as many as 60 permissions and building permits from government officials, including bureaucrats “whose main goal in life is to attract rent,” said Saurabh Mukherjea, the chief executive of institutional equities at Ambit Capital, a leading investment bank in India. One of Mr. Trump’s projects, Trump Towers Pune, is in fact under investigation by local authorities after another builder alleged that one of its permits was fraudulent. Panchshil Realty has disputed that accusation, saying the permit in question was not required for the construction. The very nature of the country’s real estate business, however, underscores larger concerns about potential damage to American efforts to discourage corruption in business abroad. In India, real estate is the main vehicle politicians and businessmen have used to invest   black money, on which taxes have not been paid. In cities, where land is scarce and extraordinarily valuable, special favors from top political leaders can lead to windfall profits, and negotiations between developers and officials are informal affairs. It is so routine for developers to pay bribes at every step of the approval process that many bureaucrats have informal rate sheets showing exactly how much must be paid to each official. Politicians not only pressure the bureaucracy to approve their pet projects, sometimes even when they are against local regulations, they also squeeze government banks to give out favorable loans. Top officials might “think in some way the U. S. president will help them,” and “can put in a friendly word with the banks” to extend loans for around 8 percent interest, rather than the characteristic 15 percent, said Vikas S. Kasliwal, the chief executive officer and vice chairman of Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure. “If the son goes himself, if the son is willing to go and meet the prime minister of India, or the urban development minister, that is a very big thing,” he said. “They will think the president is meeting them. ” Another pitfall is that Donald Trump’s partners in major projects are, in some cases, politicians themselves. Most major Indian developers have some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, with regional political leaders, who can assist in acquiring the necessary permits. Mr. Trump’s first projects in India, which are expected to increase in number over the next year, follow this pattern: His partner for Trump Towers Pune is Panchshil Realty, owned by a family that has a close and longstanding family relationship with one of the state’s most powerful politicians, Sharad Pawar, the head of the small but influential Nationalist Congress Party. (Mr. Trump was photographed  —   in an image distributed on Twitter but since taken down  —   with executives from Panchshil Realty on Nov. 15.) Mr. Pawar’s daughter, Supriya Sule, a member of Parliament, holds a 2 percent share in Panchshil’s parent company, she said in an interview. Mr. Trump’s partner in the Trump Tower Mumbai is the Lodha Group, founded by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, vice president of the Bharatiya Janata Party  —   currently the governing party in Parliament  —   in Maharashtra State. The Lodha Group has already negotiated with the United States government it announced a landmark purchase of a property, known as the Washington House, on tony Altamount Road, from the American government for 3. 75 billion rupees, almost $70 million. His partner in an office complex in Gurgaon, near New Delhi, is IREO, whose managing director, Lalit Goyal, is the    of a Bharatiya Janata member of Parliament, Sudhanshu Mittal. Mr. Mittal, in an interview, has denied having any connection with the real estate company. Suraj Hegde, the secretary of the All India Congress Committee, a national body of Indian National Congress party members, said he was troubled by the dual roles Mr. Trump and his family would play in Indian affairs  —   particularly given real estate’s important role in India’s   economy, and the clout the United States has on the world stage. “Basically this is the globalization of lobbying across countries, which then tries to establish monopoly over real estate,” Mr. Hegde said in an interview. He added that he was already calling for an independent parliamentary investigation of such maneuvers, including Mr. Trump’s real estate ventures in India. “Establishing monopoly at the cost of small players by business connections to Mr. Trump is very worrisome,” he said. “This is not at all healthy for a democracy. ” Mixing Business, Politics and Islam Mr. Trump’s business interests in Turkey are emblematic of two weighty contradictions for a businessman turned politician. As a candidate, Mr. Trump railed against moving American jobs overseas and promised to do something about it. As a businessman, he invested in a partnership with a furniture company here, making luxury furniture in the firm’s factory in western Anatolia and selling it in the United States and worldwide  —   a partnership that apparently remains active. Mr. Trump the candidate inveighed against Muslims and threatened at least a temporary ban on their entering the United States. Mr. Trump the businessman has in recent years had some of his biggest expansions overseas, including in Muslim countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and even Azerbaijan. One of the most visible   symbols of that contradiction is in the bustling commercial district of Sisli, on the European side of Istanbul, where a pair of cantilevered modernist towers, nearly 40 stories high, bear Mr. Trump’s name. Turkey’s leader, Mr. Erdogan, visited Trump Towers Istanbul  —   one holds luxury apartments and one office space, with a shopping mall connecting the two  —   after their completion in 2012, with Mr. Trump and Ivanka Trump appearing as part of the celebration the next day. “We look forward to this being the first of many   developments undertaken together in Istanbul and throughout Turkey,” Mr. Trump said in a statement issued during the visit. Beyond real estate, there is the Trump Organization’s 2013 partnership with Dorya International, a luxury furniture maker with a factory in Manisa Province, near the city of Izmir,  to build pieces sold under the Trump Home Collection. But the presidential campaign demonstrated how the goals of his business and politics ventures can come into direct conflict, particularly once Mr. Trump in December proposed barring Muslims from entering the United States, implying that all Muslims might pose a terrorist threat. “We regret and condemn Trump’s discriminatory remarks,” Bulent Kural, the manager of the Trump Towers Mall, wrote in an email to a reporter at the time, as he announced that the mall was considering removing Mr. Trump’s name. “Such statements bear no value and are products of a mind that does not understand Islam, a peace religion, at all. Our reaction has been directly expressed to the Trump family. We are reviewing the legal dimension of our relation with the Trump brand. ” Mr. Erdogan weighed in on the issue, too, saying, “The ones who put that brand on their building should immediately remove it. ” Mr. Trump’s next move helped   his standing. After a failed coup in Turkey in July, he defended Mr. Erdogan’s crackdown on dissidents, saying in an interview with The Times that the United States has to “fix our own mess” before trying to alter the behavior of other nations. “I don’t think we have a right to lecture,” Mr. Trump said in the interview. “Look at what is happening in our country,” he added, referring to violence in the United States. “How are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?” In between his two remarks  —   one infuriating the president of Turkey, the other comforting him  —   the calls for the renaming of the Trump Towers Mall ended. But much more is at stake in relations between the United States and Turkey than a shopping mall and two skyscrapers. Turkey is a key player in United States efforts to combat the Islamic State in the Middle East, and sits next door to Syria as the United States has armed rebel groups in an attempt to remove Syria’s president, Bashar   from power. The recent postelection telephone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan suggests that business and political roles will continue to be mixed. According to a Turkish journalist, Amberin Zaman, writing in the independent online news outlet Diken, Mr. Trump told the Turkish leader that he and his daughter  —   who participated in the call  —   admired both Mr. Erdogan and Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, Mr. Trump’s business associate in the towers, whom he called “a close friend. ” Ms. Zaman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, said no government officials had disputed her account of the conversation. “I’m of the opinion they were quite happy for this to be published,” she said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump declined to comment about the call. Jennifer Harris, who served on the staff of the National Intelligence Council and on the State Department’s policy planning staff, said the twin hats that Mr. Trump and his family would be wearing in Turkey would almost certainly complicate the jobs of American diplomats there. “It makes me wonder if the Trump administration will use the power of the state to help political or business allies and hurt political adversaries and business rivals,” she said. What Stance Toward Duterte? President Duterte’s antidrug campaign has led to the summary deaths of thousands of suspected criminals at the hands of police and vigilantes since he took office June 30. The killing has been condemned by human rights activists  —   and the Obama administration. In August, Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman, said the United States was “very deeply concerned” about reports of “extrajudicial killings by or at the behest of government authorities of individuals who are suspected to have been in drug activity in the Philippines. ” She added, “We have also made our concerns known. ” The question now, former State Department officials say, is just what kind of a stand the Trump administration will take as Mr. Trump and his family balance their personal and financial ties with foreign policy demands. Mr. Antonio first met Mr. Trump casually in the 1990s and has been his business partner in the Philippines for five years. President Duterte named him special envoy to the United States as the Philippines angrily pushed back at President Obama for criticizing his deadly campaign. At the time of the appointment, Mrs. Clinton was leading in the polls in the United States presidential election. Mr. Duterte has made clear that he does not appreciate American meddling in his country’s domestic affairs. “I am a president of a sovereign state, and we have long ceased to be a colony,” Mr. Duterte told reporters in early September, before a scheduled meeting in Laos with Mr. Obama that never took place. “I do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody. ” Mr. Duterte handpicked Mr. Antonio as his intermediary with the United States, said his press secretary, Ernesto Abella, because of his business success, his previous experience as a special envoy to China and the Philippine president’s “deep intuition about people. ” The appointment will be advantageous for the Philippines, Mr. Abella added, because Mr. Trump already knows Mr. Antonio. Even before Mr. Trump has been sworn in, Mr. Antonio flew to New York and visited Trump Tower, where he met with Mr. Trump’s children, who are executives at the Trump Organization  —   which oversees the  ’s real estate ventures. This was a business trip, not a diplomatic one, Robbie Antonio, Mr. Antonio’s son and the managing director of the family business, said in an interview. The two families are considering new ventures as they finish work on the Trump Tower in Makati City, a financial center within metropolitan Manila that is one of the country’s wealthiest enclaves and home to many of the nation’s elite. The $150 million tower  —   one of the tallest in the Philippines  —   is on the gritty side of Makati about two blocks from Manila’s most notorious   district, where it is common to see prostitutes soliciting business and people sleeping on sidewalks. Completion, originally scheduled for this year, is now expected in 2017. About 240 of the 260 units have been sold, said Kristina Garcia, the director for investor relations. “We are bringing Trump to the Philippines because we believe that Trump exemplifies the best quality of real estate anywhere in the world,” Mr. Antonio said in a 2011 video promoting the project  —   in which Mr. Antonio is identified as “ambassador” and Mr. Trump also appears. “It also exemplifies luxury and it exemplifies exclusivity. ” In the interview at the celebration in Manila on Thursday evening, Robbie Antonio said he had little doubt of his father’s priorities: He will put the Philippines’ interests above those of his company. “It is for the good of the country now,” he said. But Mr. Fuchs, who helped oversee United States relations with the Philippines as the deputy assistant secretary of state until early this year, said he was deeply troubled by Mr. Trump’s overlapping priorities, particularly given the long list of globally significant issues in play with the Philippines. These include planned joint military exercises in the South China Sea, the fight against militant Islamic groups based in the country’s southern islands, and the human rights abuses taking place. “What we already have is a blurring of the lines between official and business activities,” Mr. Fuchs said. “The biggest gray area may not be a President Trump himself advocating for favors for the Trump Organization. It’s the diplomats and career officers who will feel the need to perhaps not do things that will harm the Trump Organization’s interests. It is seriously disturbing. ” Over a Tiny Snail, Big Concerns The vertigo angustior snail is only two millimeters long. But it punches above its weight. The endangered little snail has helped stall Mr. Trump’s plans to build a sea wall to protect the coastline along his Trump International Golf Links course on the west coast of Ireland, in County Clare. Environmentalists, as well as surfers, list a host of concerns about the proposed wall, particularly its potential impact on sand dunes. Along with the snails, a patch of the dunes near the course is protected by European Union rules. But Mr. Trump’s organization has said the golf resort development might be dead in the water without the sea wall, and many locals welcome the business and the jobs it brings. The battle is likely to be decided next year in front of a national planning board, in the weeks or months after Mr. Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, several people said. The planning board was overhauled in the 1980s to insulate it from political meddling, and it now has the confidence of environmentalists. But there is little precedent for the Trump situation, which could involve a public hearing. “They can be long, they can be lively, and a lot of things could be aired,” said Sean O’Leary, the executive director of the Irish Planning Institute, which represents the majority of the country’s professional planners. He noted that the national planning board had considered a development proposed by a politician before, but that was a holiday home that the Irish president wanted to build. “The scale is slightly different,” he said. Local officials have said the Trump Organization needs to resubmit its application by the end of the year. In a statement, the Trump Organization said it was “considering all potential coastal protection options at present” and would be in contact with the local authority before Christmas. The snail, the statement said, “is thriving on the site. ” “Its only material threat is that presented by coastal erosion,” it added. Certainly, Mr. Trump’s golf courses in Scotland and Ireland have remained at the fore in the  ’s mind, even in recent days. Shortly after his election, he urged a group of “Brexit” campaigners led by Nigel Farage, the head of the U. K. Independence Party, to fight against wind farms in Britain. Wind farms have been a favorite target of Mr. Trump’s in both Britain and Ireland, where he has railed against proposed installations as a potential blight on the views from his resorts. After a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump initially denied that the matter had been raised with Mr. Farage’s group, Mr. Trump conceded during his interview with The Times this past week that “I might have brought it up. ” Tony Lowes, an activist who runs a group called Friends of the Irish Environment, said Mr. Trump had once called him because Mr. Lowes’s group also happened to oppose a proposed wind farm near Mr. Trump’s Irish course on environmental grounds. “He certainly hates wind farms, that’s for sure,” Mr. Lowes said about the call. His group decided against working with Mr. Trump, and is now a leading opponent of his planned sea wall. “The dune system will not be able to develop naturally,” Mr. Lowes said. “It will be starved of the sand it needs to develop and evolve and it will die. ” He added, “The whole system there is alive and mobile and moving, and the wall is intended to stop that. ” Mr. Trump’s representatives have advanced a number of rationales for the sea wall, with the most straightforward being that they simply want to buffer the land from a continuing erosion problem. The proposal has previously attracted attention because an   statement submitted by Mr. Trump’s team highlighted the risks of climate change and its influence on “coastal erosion rates. ” That was a noteworthy claim, since Mr. Trump has called global warming a hoax perpetrated “by and for the Chinese. ” The Irish government has zealously courted Mr. Trump. When he visited the course in 2014, he was greeted on the airport tarmac in Shannon with a red carpet, a harpist, a violinist and a singer whose voice cut through the runway clamor. Malachy Clerkin of The Irish Times called it “a preposterous welcome” and “the worst kind of  . ” Many locals, however, support Mr. Trump’s development. Hugh McNally, the owner of Morrissey’s Bar in Doonbeg Village, about two miles from the course, said the issue had been “sensationalized by the media” because of the Trump connection. “I’ll give you an example,” he said. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, announced last year that it would close a plant in nearby Clarecastle, causing the loss of more than 200 jobs. “If someone told them you’d save those jobs by building any wall, everyone would do it,” he said. “The only reason people are objecting here is because of Trump. ” A Transition and a Business Plan Mr. Trump’s family appears to have been preparing for the transition to the Oval Office and ways to capitalize on it both in the United States and around the globe. In April, even before Mr. Trump had secured the Republican nomination, his business moved to trademark the name American Idea for use in branding hotels, spas and concierge services, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. It was one of more than two dozen trademark applications that Mr. Trump and members of his family filed in the United States and around the world while he was running for president. The applications offer a glimpse of where the Trumps may intend to focus their business endeavors. Last month, representatives of the Trump Organization in Indonesia, where Mr. Trump has been pursuing two hotel deals, filed trademark registrations for use of the Trump name in connection with hotel management. Similar filings have been made in Mexico, Canada and the European Union. Ivanka Trump has filed at least 25 trademark registrations for her brand of clothing, cosmetics and jewelry in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Mexico since the beginning of the year, most recently in October. Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, filed an American trademark application for a line of jewelry in August. As he prepares for the presidency, Mr. Trump has made at least one concession so far, he said in the interview with The Times this past week. “In theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business,” Mr. Trump said, before later adding, “but I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that’s happening right now. ”</td>\n",

Republicans could have been unified in pointing out that conservative activists peacefully opposed   while   agitators who embody the “Salad Bowl” (instead of melting pot) America that so many Americans rightfully fear are engaging in mayhem and violence. They could have been unified in flipping the script. Instead, Messrs. Rubio, Kasich, and Cruz did what every establishment Republican does in times like this —    blame your own. You’d expect that from Rubio and Kasich, but Cruz’s response —  blaming Trump —  showed that inside, he may actually be the political careerist who has many of the same   characteristics of Hillary Clinton. Trump would not be the best GOP candidate to defeat other Democrats. But he is the perfect candidate to defeat Clinton because he, unlike more conventional Republican candidates whose   the mainstream media try to mute, has the megaphone to call her out on issues like Benghazi and her email scandal and go around the mainstream media’s filters to get his criticisms of Clinton directly to the people. The   media machine would eat   alive. And their reactions to the Chicago chaos reinforced that even more. Because of Trump, Americans who are watching biased mainstream media reports of the Chicago chaos will at least consider that   agitators may be more to blame than Trump’s supporters who just came to see their candidate give a speech. And by challenging the mainstream media’s preferred narrative of “peaceful”   agitators and “violent” conservative citizens, Trump has done much more good for the right than Kasich, Cruz, Rubio did this weekend.] 3:45: Joy Reid on MSNBC points out that Luther Campbell has said that some black voters in barbershops are saying they may vote for Trump because of his message on jobs.

Seems to be a lot of bad blood still between the two camps. Give Joy Reid, who knows Florida’s politics well, for asking Cate if the “first paragraph” in Rubio’s political obituary will be about “immigration” and his support of the Gang of Eight’s amnesty bill. You rarely hear people on   News pointing to immigration as the primary reason that Rubio’s campaign could not get out of the starting gate. Cate says many voters in Florida think Rubio used the Tea Party to get elected and “immediately abandoned” them once he got to Washington. 3:23: Trump praises “perfectly behaved crowd. ” Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton  25K in   perfectly behaved crowd.

Trump said, “There are two Donald Trumps. ” When pressed by the media on what that means, Trump said that there is the Trump who brawled his way through the primary and the guy who is “thoughtful” and “reads and thinks. ” Trump is presenting himself as inevitable, as someone prepared to unify.

Clinton accuse Trump of “starting his political activity” based on this “racist lie that our first Black President was not an American citizen. ” Clinton brings up that the Justice Department sued Trump twice for discriminating against prospective tenants. She says the “birther lie” was a “hurtful one” because Obama is a man of dignity. She says it bothered Obama and quotes Michelle Obama, who said, “when they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high despite Donald Trump’s best efforts to bring him down. ” 10:01: Trump says he thinks he has developed very good relations with the “  community” and he says he thinks he has done a great   for the   the president to get him to release his birth certificate. 9:59: Holt brings up the birther controversy. Trump says Clinton confidante Sidney Blumenthal and former campaign manager Patty Solis Doyle failed to get Obama’s birth certificate. He says he succeeded in getting the birth certificate and he wants to get on with fighting ISIS and securing the border. Holt says the birth certificate was presented in 2012 and he continued to express doubts. Trump is blaming Clinton’s allies for starting the controversy. 9:58: Trump says the   community has been let down by politicians who “abuse and use” them to get votes. Trump says he’s been all over while, looking at Clinton, “you decided to stay home. And that’s okay. ” Clinton says she thinks Trump criticized her for preparing for this debate.

He doesn’t mention that Americans can easily lose their Second Amendment rights due to bureaucratic errors. [Again, another example of Trump not being able to finesse a complex issue. Shows lack of preparation re: basic questions.] Trump defends stop and frisk after slamming Clinton for calling black criminals “super predators. ” 9:54: When asked about implicit biases against black people, Clinton says implicit bias is a problem not just for police but for everyone. She says everyone needs to ask hard questions about “why am I feeling this way?” 9:47: Clinton now pushing gun control. She says police are often outgunned by people with “militaristic” weapons. 9:45: Trump says we need “law and order” or we’re not going to have a country.  He says “we have a situation” where   and Hispanics in our inner cities are “living in hell” because “it’s so dangerous. ” He mentions the thousands of shootings in Chicago and says “we have to stop the violence” and “bring back law and order” in a place like Chicago. Trump now talks about illegal immigrant gang members roaming the streets and says we have to be “very vigilant. ” He says our police are afraid to do anything right now and “we have to protect our inner cities” because “  communities are being decimated by crime. ” Holt says stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York because it was a form of racial profiling. Clinton points out that stop and frisk was found to be “unconstitutional. ” Clinton talking about mandatory minimums and ending the privatization of the prison system. Clinton says she believes strongly that “commonsense gun measures should assist us. ” [Trump should have better answers and pivots to these very predictable questions.] 9:43: Debate turns to race relations. Holt says “one of you will have to bridge” a bitter divide. Clinton says race determines where people live and what kind of education people get and how they are treated in the criminal justice system. Clinton says “we’ve got to do several things at the same time. ” She says we have to “restore trust between communities and police” and police are   to use force only when necessary. 9:41: Trump says “it’s all words and soundbites. ” Trump, now defending the bankruptcy filings, says he used certain laws four times. He says he has taken advantage of the laws of the nation and his obligation is to do well for himself, his family, his employees, his companies. 9:40: Clinton says she has met tons of small business folks who were stiffed by Trump. When Clinton says thousands of people were stiffed, Trump says “maybe they didn’t do a good job. ” Clinton says she is relieved that her late father never did business with Trump. Clinton says sometimes there is not a “direct transfer of skills from business to government. ” 9:36: Clinton says she made a “mistake” using a private email server. She says she is “not going to make any excuses. ” Trump says “that was more than a mistake. ” He accuses Clinton of “purposefully” setting up a private email server. Trump says “you don’t learn that much from tax returns” and says her use of a private email server was “disgraceful. ” Trump now claims he is severely “ . ” Trump now pivoting to infrastructure, saying our country’s infrastructure is like a “  country” while spending trillions of dollars in the Middle East. He blames “politicians like Secretary Clinton” for causing these problems. Trump says we don’t have the money to rebuild our country because politicians like Clinton have squandered the country’s money. Clinton accuses Trump of not paying income taxes and not contributing to the treasury. 9:33: Trump says he will release his tax returns against his lawyers’s wishes as soon as Clinton releases here 33, 000 deleted emails. Some cheers in the audience. Holt admonishes the audience. Clinton says you’ve seen another example of “bait and switch here. ” She says everyone running for president has released tax returns. “You gotta ask yourself —  why won’t he release his tax returns? she says. Clinton says maybe Trump is not as rich as he says he is. She says maybe Trump is not as charitable as he says he is. Clinton says maybe he doesn’t want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes. She also suggests Trump may owe money to Wall Street and foreign entities. Clinton trying to provoke Trump. She says “it must be something important” or “terrible” that Trump is trying to hide. [Holt doesn’t bring up Clinton’s emails. Trump had to do that.] 9:32: Holt asks Trump about his tax returns. Trump says he doesn’t mind releasing his tax returns but he is under a “routine audit” and he will release his return once the audit is complete. 9:31: Trump says Yellin and the Fed are doing “political things. ” He says the Fed will raise interest rates and “very bad things will happen” and the Fed is “being more political than Secretary Clinton. ” 9:30: [To use a football analogy, not an offensive showdown here. This is like two teams getting to the   line and punting, which is what often happens in   first halves of Super Bowls.] 9:29: Clinton seems to be getting under Trump’s skin a bit by talking about the “Trump loophole” and “    economics. ” 9:24: When Clinton falsely claims she will also cut a lot of regulations, Trump shakes his head. [Good visual for Trump.] Trump says Clinton will raise $1. 3 trillion worth of taxes. Trump ridicules Clinton for having a plan to fight ISIS on her website and Clinton says “at least I have a plan. ” Trump says Clinton has been fighting ISIS for her entire adult life because she telegraphs her plans to the enemy. Clinton says she has a feeling that she will be blamed for everything that has gone wrong. Trump says “why not?” Clinton mocks Trump for saying “crazy things” and Trump says it’s not crazy to talk about his plans for repatriation. 9:23: Trump says Clinton will tax and regulate businesses out of existence. Trump says when he travels around the country, people like that he has proposed to cut unnecessary regulations. He says he is going to “cut taxes big league” and “you’re going to raise taxes big league. End of story. ” Clinton promotes the home page of her website as a     site. Trump asks voters to take a look at his home page as well. 9:21: Trump says Clinton was “totally in favor” of the TPP and only changed her position when Trump’s opposition to the trade deal was resonating. Clinton, sounding lawyerly says she was against it once the terms were negotiated. Clinton says, “Donald, I know you live in your own reality” but those are not the facts. “Secretary, you have no plan,” Trump says. Clinton says she has a book of plans and says you can pick one up at the airport. She says “we have a very robust set of plans. ” [Clinton sounding like the    student who always sits at the front of the class and brings the teacher an apple.] 9:19: When Clinton says her husband did a great job, Trump says he approved NAFTA, which is one of the worst deals ever. Trump’s first “excuse me” of the night when he corrects Clinton, who is on the defensive over trade deals.   @HillaryClinton Has Demonstrated Her Position On Trade Is Purely Political #Debates https:  .   —   Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 27, 2016,  9:17: Clinton accuses Trump of believing that the Chinese created the climate change hoax. Trump interrupts and says that’s not true. Trump seems to bring up Solyndra as an example of the Dems’s failed green energy policy. Trump says Clinton cannot do what she is proposing to do when the country is $20 trillion in debt. Trump says we have to give companies better incentives to grow at home. He says you only have to look at Ohio and Michigan to see where all of the factories have left. Trump asks Clinton why she has just been proposing solutions on trade now when she has been in this for 30 years. Trump says he can bring back jobs and she can’t. 9:13: Trump must be in this to win it. He does NOT take the bait that Clinton threw out about his father having loaned him $14 million and   the matter endlessly. 9:12: Trump says we don’t know what we’re doing re: devaluation. He says we have to renegotiate our trade deals. Trump asks why hasn’t Clinton made trade deals better? He says Secretary Clinton should have been opposed to these trade deals years ago.

Trump sells better than anyone you have ever seen, even if you haven’t personally bought into him yet. You can’t deny his persuasion talents that have gotten him this far. In summary, I don’t understand the policy details and implications of most of either Trump’s or Clinton’s proposed ideas. Neither do you. But I do understand persuasion.

Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved —  and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.

Clinton says she respects Trump’s children and they say a lot about Donald. Trump says he considers Clinton’s comments about his children to be a nice compliment. Trump says Clinton “doesn’t quit” and “doesn’t give up. ” “I tell it like it is,” Trump says. Trump says Clinton is a “fighter” though she disagrees with a lot of what she is fighting for.

Trump had to bring that point up. She slams Trump for using steel that the Chinese dumped. 10:27: Trump wonders how Clinton made so much money after leaving elected office. He says Clinton made millions because of the power of her office and wonders why she isn’t putting any of her money into the campaign  …     Trump says he is not beholden to special interests like Clinton. Scene in the spin room right now  —   reporters waiting to see who will enter pic. twitter.   —   MaryAlice Parks (@maryaliceparks) October 10, 2016,  10:24: Raddatz keeps interrupting Trump and says “we have to get the audience” after she monopolized parts of the debate. 10:21: Cooper asks about Trump about “discipline” and his early morning Tweets about a former Miss Universe’s alleged sex tape. Trump says “Tweeting happens to be a   form of communication. ” He says it’s a “very effective way of communication. ” “I’m not   of it,” he says. When asked if Trump has the discipline to be president, Clinton says, “no. ” She says it’s in part because “those of who have had the great privilege to see this job up close and know how difficult it is. ” 10:20: Raddatz again giving people distrustful of the mainstream press every reason to continue to do so. Why is Raddatz debating trump? Isnt that hillarys job?  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) October 10, 2016,  10:18: Cooper presses Clinton on her “deplorables” comment. He asks how can Clinton unite a country if she has written off tens of millions of Americans. Clinton says her argument is not with his supporters but with Trump and his “hateful” and “divisive comments. ” She claims Trump “incites violence” at rallies. No mention of   agitators who attacked Trump supporters in places like Chicago and Northern California. Trump on Clinton: ”Believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. When she said ’deplorables,’ she meant it” https:  .   —   CNN (@CNN) October 10, 2016,  10:14: Trump, in response to questioner, who asks about whether the candidates can be a devoted president for all Americans.. says Clinton has called Americans “deplorables” and he will be a president for “all Americans. ” He says he will be the president for “all of the people. ” Trump talks about the inner cities and says politicians talk about helping   and Hispanics in the inner cities and they do  nothing about it. Clinton lists her accomplishments with the Children’s Defense Fund and helping underserved communities in the South. Clinton again brings up the   Trump Effect (the study was unscientific). 10:13: Trump points out that when Clinton goes a minute over her allowed time, nobody interrupts. He says the moderators interrupt the second he goes over his time. 10:12: Clinton says it’s not “smart strategy” for American forces to be occupying Syria. She says Trump claims he knows more about ISIS than the generals. “No, he doesn’t” she says. 10:07: Trump says almost everything Clinton has done in foreign policy has been a “mistake” and “disaster. ” Trump says Clinton made Iran powerful with possibly “the dumbest deal I have ever seen. ” Trump says Iran and Russia are now against us. Trump now says Clinton doesn’t even know who the rebels are. He says he doesn’t know Assad but at least he’s killing ISIS. Raddatz keeps trying to make Trump bad by acting like a    college professor who knows more than the candidate (this is why the public hates the mainstream press). It seems like Trump is debating Raddatz instead of Clinton.  ”He and I haven’t spoken and I disagree,” says @realDonaldTrump of @mike_pence on possible Syria intervention. @MarthaRaddatz everyone.  —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) October 10, 2016,  10:06: Hillary’s got the fly vote https:  .   —   Best Vines (@TheFunnyVine) October 10, 2016,  My first time on live television. #HilaryClintonFly pic. twitter.   —   Hilary Clinton Fly (@fly_hilary) October 10, 2016,  10:05: Clinton is asked about Syria. Online questioner makes comparison to the Holocaust. Clinton says there is a determined effort by the Russians to destroy “Aleppo” to get rid of the last of the rebels against Assad. She says she has advocated   and safe zones. 10:03: Is this debate about the moderators or the actual supposedly “undecided” voters? There doesn’t seem to be that much engagement with the actual voters in the room. 9:58: Cooper grills Trump on taxes. He says he used deductions in the tax code that people like Clinton allowed. She says Clinton has wealthy friends who want to keep the carried interest provisions in place. Trump says he pays tax and federal income tax. Trump says Clinton is “all talk and no action. ” He keeps bringing up Sanders’s quote about Clinton’s “bad judgment. ” He now slams Clinton for creating the vacuum in the Middle East that allowed ISIS to form. “Congratulations, great job,” Trump says. Clinton says she has been in favor of getting rid of carried interests. “Why didn’t you do it?” Trump asks. Clinton says because she was a Senator with a Republican President. “Under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power,” Clinton shoots back. 9:55: Clinton says Trump lives in an “alternative reality” and “everything Trump has said is not true. ” Clinton implies Trump may not have paid taxes for 20 years and she says “Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald. ” She accuses Trump of wanting to help the rich with his tax plan. It seems like Clinton doesn’t know anything about Trump’s tax plan and is just repeating typical Dem. talking points about Republicans on taxes. Clinton wants the Buffet rule and a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. She claims she wants to invest in   families. 9:54: Trump says Clinton has been there for 30 years and the system has never changed and will never change under Clinton. [Trump should use this opportunity to frame this election as one between an outsider versus consummate insider but he just is not adept at framing the race in ways he should.[ 9:53: Questioner asks what he would change in the tax code to ensure that the wealthy “pay their fair share. ” Trump says he would “knock out the tax code” and get rid of the “carried interest provision. ” [These are “undecided” voters?] 9:51: “Honest Abe never lied,” Trump says. “That’s the difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. ” He says Clinton got caught lying after the Wikileaks dump and is now blaming Lincoln for her lies. Trump says he has no loans from Russia and doesn’t know anything about the country’s inner workings. He points out that the U. S. government has seen his balance sheet and chose him to do the Old Post Office building. After Clinton calls on Trump to release his taxes, Trump says  people like Warren Buffet and George Soros took “massive deductions. ” He says he would be “very proud” to release his taxes after his routine audit is done. 9:48: Clinton now claims that her comments about   positions was in reference to Lincoln. [What spin!] She now says Russians are engaged in hacking to get Trump elected and talks up Trump’s praise of Putin. Moderators let Clinton talk, talk, talk   again before Raddatz FINALLY interrupts for one of the first times. I’m told the women Trump invited to the debate are set to appear in the   spin room, per campaign aide. #debate,  —   Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) October 10, 2016,  9:45: Clinton claims that terrorist recruiters are using Trump’s words to recruit more terrorists. Trump points out that Clinton went 25 seconds over her time and the moderators didn’t interrupt. Trump points out that Clinton, when she was Secretary of State, didn’t force countries to accept illegal immigrants who committed crimes like murder. Trump says drugs are pouring through our Southern border “at a record clip” and Clinton doesn’t understand the border and wants amnesty. Trump says Clinton’s judgment is so bad that she should never be president. [Now would be a good time for Trump to point out Clinton’s wikileaks emails about open borders and her need for   positions. Raddatz transitions to the question from a voter about whether it is okay for a politician to be  .] 9:43: Raddatz helps Clinton even in her questioning, saying “we know you want tougher vetting. ” Again, the moderators are like rasslin’ announcers doing their best to make Clinton get “over” with the audience while trying to turn Trump into the “heel” that that audience hates. Is Trump skilled enough to be the   and heel that rasslin’ crowds started to love in the Attitude Era like Stone Cold Steve Austin? 9:41: Clinton says “we are not at war with Islam. ”  She says she wants a country where citizens like you are welcome just like everyone else. Raddatz piles on, again pressing Trump on his Muslim ban. She asks if Trump supports the Muslim ban. Trump says if he had been president, Captain Kahn would have been alive today because he would not have gone into Iraq like Clinton. He calls him an “American hero. ” Raddatz keeps grilling Trump. The moderators have hardly interrogated Clinton tonight. Trump keeps trying to explain his “extreme vetting” program and says Clinton wants more Syrian refugees. “The great Trojan Horse of all time,” he says. Trump says he doesn’t want hundreds of thousands of people from Syria coming in when we don’t know nothing about their values or their love for our country.   9:39: Clinton thanks the questioner for asking the question. She says there have been “divisive” and “dark” things said about Muslims. She brings up Trump’s attacks on the Kahn family. Clinton talks about the country’s famous Muslims and says we just lost one in Muhammad Ali. Clinton says it’s   and “dangerous” for Trump to be engaged in demagogic comments about Muslims. [These are “UNDECIDED” voters?] 9:37: Muslim questioner asks Trump about Islamophobia. “You’re right about islamophobia, and that’s a shame,” Trump says, again showing that he wants to appease whomever is speaking to him. But he says we have to get Muslims to report what they see in their communities. Trump now says Clinton and Obama won’t use the term “radical Islamic terrorism” and “before you solve it, you have to say the name. ” 9:36: Cooper grills Trump on specifics re:    (he wants to know how he would get insurance companies to insure uninsured people without a mandate) care while Hillary Clinton smirks as Trump is under fire. 9:32: Trump says Obamacare is a disaster and is only getting worse. He says Obamacare is expensive for those who have it and unbelievably expensive for the country. He says we have to replace it with something that is less expensive and words. He again talks about getting rid of the lines around the states. He says Clinton wants a   plan like Canada and has been after this for years. He says Obamacare is just the first step. [Trump did not mention that Bill Clinton called it crazy. Anderson Cooper had to do that. Again, lack of preparation showing for Trump.] 9:29: Questioner asks about Obamacare. Cooper tries to give Clinton the first bite at the apple. After Trump starts to answer, Clinton says let him take it. Trump says he’s a gentleman so he will allow Clinton to answer. She says what Donald would have said was that he would repeal it while she will “fix it. ” Clinton says people can’t be denied coverage because of   conditions and there are no lifetime limits under Obamacare. She says people under 24 can be on their parents’s plans under Obamacare. She says, though, small businesses need additional help. Clinton says if we repeal Obamacare, “all of those benefits are lost to everybody  …    ” [Classic. Put in a government program and make it impossible to repeal once folks need the benefits.] 9:28: “Okay, Donald,” Clinton says. She says Trump wants to do anything to avoid talking about his “exploding campaign” and GOP establishment Republicans deserting him. Trump says the debate once again is a    battle. 9:27: Trump says Clinton is again “lying” about her deleted 33, 000 emails after getting a subpoena. “I am so disappointed in Congressman, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen,” Trump says. He blasts Bill Clinton for talking to Attorney General Loretta Lynch nearly a month before the matter was decided. 9:25: Clinton says he email scandal was a “mistake” and she’s not “making any excuses about it. ” crowd in hall laughed when @HillaryClinton tried to say it was true that she deleted 30, 000 emails #debate #debate2016,  —   Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) October 10, 2016,  [Trump has an opportunity to say this election is about his words vs. a candidate who endangered the country’s national security with her private email server. Will he?] 9:24: “Because you’d be in jail,” Trump says after Clinton says she’s glad someone with Trump’s temperament who is in charge of enforcing the country’s laws. 9:23: Trump says people’s lives have been destroyed for doing a fifth of what Clinton has done and she should be ashamed of her actions. Clinton now says “everything” Trump says was absolutely false re: her private emails. 9:19: Clinton claims what “so much of what Trump said is not right. ” A very legalese answer. She says “so much” but not “all” or “everything” as she tries to evade the question. She quotes Michelle Obama about going high when they go low. Clinton says everyone can draw their conclusions about the man in the video or the man on stage respects women. Clinton now brings up the Kahn family to evade the question. Funny, the moderators aren’t interrupting her like they did with Trump. Clinton brings up Judge Curiel. She accuses Trump of mocking a disabled reporter. She brings up Trump’s “racist lie” that Obama was not born in the United States. Clinton says Trump has never apologized and owes Obama an apology. Trump says she owes Obama an apology because the Clinton campaign and her allies started the birther controversy. Trump now brings up some vicious commercials Michelle Obama cut in 2008 about Hillary Clinton. He now says Obama defeated her “fair and square” but Clinton didn’t defeat Obama fairly because the election was rigged, citing the Wikileaks email dump. Trump says if he wins, he is going to instruct the Attorney General to get a “special prosecutor to look into your situation. ”  9:17: Raddatz again grills Trump on the tape. Trump says he is not proud of the tape and is a person who has “great respect” for people. Trump says if you look at Bill Clinton, “mine are words” and “his are actions. ” Trump says nobody in the history of politics have been as “abusive to women” as Bill Clinton. Trump says Hillary Clinton attacked those victims viciously. Trump now informs the world that Hilary Clinton laughed at a    rape victim. “Don’t tell me about words,” Trump says. “But what President Clinton did  …     When Hillary brings up a point like that  …    . I think it’s disgraceful and she ought to be ashamed of herself. ” 9:12: Cooper gives Clinton a chance to respond. She says she has spent the past 48 hours thinking about the tape. Clinton says she has never questioned the fitness of other GOP candidates to serve and she says “Donald Trump is different. ” She says Trump is “not fit to serve” as president. She says Trump claimed the video doesn’t represent who he is but “it represents exactly who he is. ” Clinton says Trump has insulted women and ranked women on their appearances while also embarrassing women on television and Twitter. She blasts Trump for “denigrating a former Miss Universe” in harsh and vulgar terms. Clinton says it’s not only the video that raises questions about Trump’s fitness. She accuses Trump now of attacking minorities as well as she desperately tries to cobble together the Obama coalition. [Once again, Clinton schooling Trump on how to pivot. Trump should have said that though he made inappropriate comments, America needs someone who puts America first instead of the special interests and globalists. He needs to frame the election in this manner.] Trump shoots back on HRC says ”it’s just words, folks, it’s just words”  —   Lauren Blanchard (@LaurenBlanch12) October 10, 2016,  9:10: Cooper now brings up Trump’s tape. Cooper says Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Trump says this is “  talk. ” He says he is not proud of it and has apologized for it. Trump says he will knock the hell out of ISIS. Cooper keeps pressing Trump on the tape. He says he has “great respect” for women while Cooper keeps pressing him on whether he has touched women without their consent. “No, I have not,” Trump says before pivoting back to needing borders and making America safe and wealthy again. 9:08: Trump says he entered the campaign because he got tired of seeing “foolish” things being done by politicians. He brings up Obamacare, the Iran Deal (“  transaction” with a “terrorist state”). Trump says America has tremendous potential and brings up the country’s massive trade deficit. He says we’re going to have a “strong border” and “bring back law and order. ” “We have to bring back respect to law enforcement,” he says. Trump says he wants to do things that haven’t been done, like fixing the inner cities to help   and  . 9:06: First questioner asks Clinton about how the last debate could have been rated “MA” and whether the candidates’s behavior is appropriate for today’s youth? (Clinton’s lies re: her private email server is model behavior?) This gives Clinton a perfect opportunity to go over her talking points on a range of issues on various policy issues re: wanting to be a president for “all Americans. ” 9:05: Trump and Clinton walk on stage. They seem tense and don’t shake hands.   9:02: Bill Clinton and Melania Trump shake hands along with the Trump family. #Debates #DebateNight pic. twitter.   —   Good Morning America (@GMA) October 10, 2016,  8:58: Dana Bash in CNN points out that Bill Clinton does not have a good poker face, and he looks very, very uncomfortable tonight at the debate, especially since women who have accused him of sexual assault are in the audience with him.

Can he frame the race tonight as one between Americanism vs. globalism, as one between a flawed candidate who will always put America First vs. a flawed candidate who has always put the interests of the globalists first in a way he failed to do in the first debate? 7:07: Kind of funny given that so many   union workers are still considering Trump because they do not like Hillary Clinton’s    agenda. This is definitely a typo. There’s no Trump in Trumka #washudebate2016 pic. twitter.   —   Richard L. Trumka (@RichardTrumka) October 9, 2016,  7:05: It’s worth nothing that the GOP establishment pile on has exposed so much of the hypocrisy on the GOP establishment side. When news about Schwarzenegger’s groping came to light during his gubernatorial run, the GOP establishment all rallied around him and came to his defense. ”The weak, feckless leadership of the Republican Party is who’s leaving, the people who live inside the Beltway,” Lewandowski said on CNN.  —   Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) October 9, 2016,  As proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that I hold above all else  —   American. My full statement: pic. twitter.   —   Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) October 8, 2016,  7:00: Though the mainstream media and both establishments in the permanent political class have piled on on Trump in earnest this week, Clinton has still not put the race away. Why? The bottom line is Hillary Clinton is still a deeply flawed candidate who cannot connect well with voters. In addition, her support of open borders and   policies have prevented many undecided voters, especially   voters, from going to her side. And that’s why, despite all of Trump’s flaws, many of which have been   he still seems like the football team that is only one possession away in the second half from tying up the game despite having committed turnover after turnover throughout the game.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Welcome to Breitbart News’s live updates of the 2016 horse race. GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich will participate in a CNN town hall event in Wisconsin tonight and answer questions from voters.   —   All times eastern. 10:55: Kasich he has not talked with the Cruz campaign to strategize on how to deny Trump the delegates he needs to secure the nomination. But he says that campaigns always talked “and I’m not in the middle of that” and he hasn’t seen Ted since the last debate. He says he is not involved in the “process stuff. ” 10:48: Kasich is asked about a potential vice president and he says that is “like measuring the drapes” and is “so far down the road. ” He says you want to pick someone who you are comfortable with and someone who understands what you are all about but is also unafraid to speak up to you. “You can’t just surround yourself with sycophants,” he says. 10:45: Kasich says he knew Medicaid expansion would not be popular. He also says he fought for corporate welfare reform when asked about unpopular decisions he has made. Kasich tells the questioner he would never believe how hard it was to balance the federal budget but it inspired a new wave of Republicans like Joe Scarborough to run for office. He says he is as much of a   now as he was then. 10:43: Kasich says we have to be careful about litmus tests when asked if he would appoint a Supreme Court Justice who will create a protected class for the unborn.   10:39: A questioner who races sled dogs asks Kasich about his policies on small businesses. Kasich speaks up his record in Ohio. He says small businesses pay virtually no taxes in Ohio and he wants to lower the income tax nationally. He says we also have to be careful not to snuff out the small lending businesses (community banks). He says the overregulation of the big banks have put smaller banks, which best know people in the local communities, go out of business. Kasich also talks about workforce development. He says kids should be educated for jobs that exist. 10:37: Kasich is asked whether he would support the GOP nominee. Kasich says “maybe I won’t answer it either. ” He says when you are in the arena, you develop respect for people who are in the arena. But he says he has been disturbed by some of the things he has seen and he wants to see how it “finishes out. ” He says he sure hopes the other candidates endorse him for president when he gets the nomination at the convention. “Frankly, all of us shouldn’t even have answered the question,” Kasich says. Kasich says if the nominee is someone who is   the country, “I can’t stand behind him. ” 10:30: Questioner asks Kasich why European security still remains the responsibility of Americans when Europeans are wealthy enough to defend themselves. Kasich says because “that’s what leaders do” but says the Europeans can do more. Kasich says “we don’t want to have those relationships deteriorate” or “be eliminated” because “we need to have a strong Western Europe. ” Kasich says we should arm Ukraine. He says we should tell Europe they need to do more and use whatever leverage we have to get them to do more but America has always carried most of the burden in his lifetime. Kasich says you can’t knock all the pieces off the chessboard when you get frustrated. 10:26: Kasich says we need to have “open and free trade. ” He says U. S. cars got better when Japanese cars came into the country. But he says when countries cheat on trade agreements, “we need to call them on it. ” Kasich says when other countries cheat, “I will act as president of the United States. ” He says Wisconsin fans would not put up with Ohio State asking for five downs (tell that to Missouri!) while the Badgers got four downs and we shouldn’t put up with countries that cheat. Kasich says he can say all kinds of things to get people stirred up but leaders say things that are unpopular re: his support for the   Partnership. He says he was one of the most unpopular governors and now is one of the most popular. 10:23: Student who is leaning towards Trump says that the Brussels attacks highlighted the problem with neighborhoods that are hotbeds of terrorism. He asks if Kasich supports Cruz’s proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods. Kasich says he agrees with Bratton that Cruz’s idea is “ridiculous. ” Kasich says Muslims won’t help the government find the bad guys if the government patrols their neighborhoods. 10:22: Questioner wonders if “ ” forces will rise like they have been in Europe. Kasich says we “have to protect the border. That is a given. ” He wants a   program. Kasich again says he wants a path to “legalization” and “not a path to citizenship” for illegal immigrants. Kasich says we need “healing” in America and his solution is “reasonable. ” 10:21: Kasich makes a good point that he led the fight to balance the budget in the 1990s and the GOP Congress spent it. 10:17: Questioner asks Kasich about expanding Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. He is asked why he chose the   solution. Kasich points out that the Milwaukee   endorsed him today. Kasich says he wanted to take care of the poor and   and   Ohioans. He says that was the “compassionate” thing to do. Kasich claims he is not for Obamacare because he did not accept the exchanges. 10:14: Kasich says his top strategist Weaver get a “little  ” and didn’t know of his Tweet about “Lyin’ Ted” and he’ll have a word with him later on in the night. 10:12: Kasich says we can’t police Muslim neighborhoods because we can’t risk polarizing those already in the civilized world. 10:08: When asked about Brussels, Kasich says we need better worldwide intelligence and the U. S. president can rally the world to destroy people who want to destroy us. He wants to change NATO into a   organization that works across boundaries. He says it is “absurd” to suggest like Trump that NATO is “obsolete. ” But he concedes that NATO countries won’t do as much as we want. 10:06: Kasich says he is best positioned to defeat Clinton in the fall and has more experience than anyone other than Clinton. He says he was ignored in most of the debates and people have just started paying attention in the last month. 10:05: Kasich says he hasn’t seen the Lewandowski video but has heard it was definitive and he would fire him if he were his campaign manager. 10:00: Kasich on deck. 9:57: Questioner says  her father is impressed with all of his kids and wonders why Trump can’t be more like his sons who are so “  and calm. ” Trump says “I hear that. ” Trump says he gets so many compliments on his children. Trump says his children have “great heart” and have a “wonderful, wonderful feeling” for people. Trump says the world is taking advantage of the United States and driving us to be a   nation. “It’s time to rebuild our country,” Trump says. Cooper wonders if Trump will call his new grandson “Cryin’ Ted. ” Trump says no chance. Trump then asks, “Isn’t Ted’s real name Rafael?” 9:55: A Wisconsin Dairy Farmer who is leaning towards Trump asks him about immigration. Trump says he doesn’t want to affect business but people must come in “legally” through visa programs and it will work out “beautifully. ” He then shifts to trade and says other countries are not accepting U. S. goods while we accept their goods without tax. He says we will straighten out our trade policies so Americans will get a lot more business. 9:54: Trump says town halls are much better than debates. He says more debates aren’t necessary because the same people just keep asking the same questions. 9:50: Trump is asked when he has learned from something and changed his behavior. Trump says he believes in flexibility and negotiate great deals and “it’s not all about signing executive orders. ” Cooper is doing a good job of getting the candidates to actually answer the question. Trump says he has changed course on “many, many things. ” Trump says he is now   and he was originally   and he has “evolved” and “made certain changes. ” When Cooper asks when was the last time Trump has apologized for something, Trump answers, “Oh, Wow. ” Trump says he believes in apologizing if he is wrong. Trump says he apologized to his mother for using foul language and to his wife for not acting presidential. Trump says “my biggest problems are repeats and  . ”  9:46: Trump says he assumes Paul Ryan is “being straight with me” but he has been reading reports that Ryan is having “clandestine” meetings to potentially get the nomination at a contested convention. Trump says people who have never voted before are now voting for him. Trump mentions he got a few hundred more votes in Missouri. And Trump says it’s “bad politics” that someone who wins the election gets fewer delegates in Louisiana than the person who lost. Final #’s just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #’s show a 365 vote increase for   @ least 12 more delegates!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2016,  9:45: Trump: Romney should root for us instead of being a “negative force. ” Trump says one of the biggest stories politics is all of the new voters turning out to vote for him and getting engaged in politics. Trump slams Cruz’s for his campaign’s dirty tricks against “honorable” Ben Carson and he says he watched Cruz and saw how “tormented he was” when asked if he would support the GOP nominee. “I don’t want his support. I don’t need his support. I want him to be comfortable,” Trump says of Cruz. He says he doesn’t want to make people like    and others he has driven out of the race to “do something against their will. ” Now Trump says he is a “unifier” and claims “some day you will see that. ” 9:42: Trump says no longer promises to support the GOP nominee and he doesn’t need Cruz’s support. He wants the support of the people. He says the RNC, the Republican Party and the establishment have treated him “unfairly. ” He now blasts Romney. [Tony Lee: This town hall should be another   call for Trump and his campaign. As I’ve said before, Trump is a hurler who throws gas, but he isn’t a pitcher yet. A thrower can’t beat Clinton in a general election. When asked about the federal government’s responsibilities, Trump should have said controlling illegal immigration and enforcing the country’s immigration laws. A gigantic opportunity missed. And another unforced error.] 9:36: Trump says the New York Times mocked him for saying Belgium was a “hellhole” and he has been proven right. He says NATO should be “rejiggered” and there are countries in NATO that are “getting a free ride” and “it’s unfair. ” He says the United States can’t be the policemen of the world and “we have to rebuild our own country. ” Trump says we have very big problems in our country. He says NATO has to be changer or “we have to do something. ” 9:34: Questioner asks Trump why he believes the U. S. Should have a diminishing role in NATO. Trump says NATO doesn’t cover terrorism and it has to be changed for the better and “we’re paying too much” for NATO. 9:32: Trump says he is in for about $35 million and he claims he has never even thought about whether his campaign would pay him back down the line. Trump says there is “no influence over me. ” He says   and gas are giving Cruz a lot of money while he is fundraising off of selling his “Make America Great” hats. 9:28: Trump is asked what, in his opinion, are the top three functions of the U. S. government. Trump says “security, health care, education. ” But he says the top three are “security, security, security” so we can continue to exist as a country. He says thousands are infiltrating our country and “we don’t know who they are. ” Cooper points out that Trump has said he is against Common Core and wonders why is thinks education is one of the top functions of government. Same with health care. 9:26: Trump is asked what he would say to people who claim he has not been successful in business. Trump says he started off with a $1 million loan from his father that he paid back. He says he started with $1 million and is now worth $10 billion. 9:24: Trump says we have to look “very seriously” at the mosques. Trump says he trust many Muslims but “some, I guess, we don’t. ” Trump says we can be politically correct and pretend we don’t have a problem but “this is a war. ” He says the difference is the terrorists don’t have uniforms and we don’t know who they are. 9:20: Questioner points out that 99% of people who wear turbans are Sikhs and how America can fight radical Islam while protecting the Constitution. Trump says we have a “serious” problem with radical Islam. He says he thought he would go down in the polls after calling for a temporary ban on Muslims but instead he went up in the polls. Trump says we have a “very, very serious problem” with radical Islam and “if we don’t want to discuss it, if we don’t want to look at it,” then we won’t solve the problem. He says we have no choice but to wipe ISIS “violently” off the face of the earth. He says he was against the Iraq War but we have no choice but to be “very vigilant,” smart, and “tough. ” He says thousands of people are entering the country from Syria and we have no idea who they are. He says they have no paperwork, no identification. Cooper asks Trump how he will protect the rights of minorities as the questioner ask. Trump says he wants to do that but we have a serious problem with radical Islam. 9:17: Trump says he thinks the Twitter photo he   of Heidi Cruz was a “fine” picture of her. When Trump says “I didn’t start it,” Cooper says Trump is making the argument of a    child. Trump says he would love to leave wives out of it and talk about nuclear proliferation but “I didn’t send the photo to everybody in the state of Utah. He did it. ” Trump says he doesn’t let things go so easy and he would let other countries taking advantage of the U. S on trade, etc. He insists that Cruz’s friends and allies are running the   group that sent around his wife’s GQ photo to voters in Utah. 9:14: Cooper keeps grilling Trump about allowing   Korea to get nuclear weapons. Trump suggests Japan must pay the United States or protect itself. Cooper asks Trump if he doesn’t want more nuclear weapons but is okay with Japan having nuclear weapons. Trump keeps evading the question as Cooper keeps pressing him to answer the question like he did with Cruz. Trump says he would rather see Japan having some form of defense and maybe some offense against North Korea. Trump: “The only global warming I’m worried about is nuclear global warming. ”  —   daveweigel (@daveweigel) March 30, 2016,  9:10: Trump says the phone rang and Clinton wasn’t there “unless Sydney called. ” Trump says of all the people running, he is the only one who can solve the terror problem in Pakistan. Trump says Pakistan is a “vital problem” and country because they have nuclear weapons. Trump says he will solve radical Islamic terrorism “far better than anyone else. ” Trump gets boos after suggesting the Cruz supporters in the audience were planted by CNN.  —   Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 30, 2016,  9:08: Trump Fields should not have been   him and she wasn’t supposed to be asking questions because the press conference had ended. Now Trump says Fields’s pen could “have been a knife. ” MILWAUKEE  —   Trump on CNN has crowd laughing: ”My arm, it’s never been the same folks.”  —   Kevin Cirilli (@kevcirilli) March 30, 2016,  ”My arm has never been the same folks.”   —   Donald Trump eviscerating Michelle Fields #GOPTownHall,  —   Mike Mack (@MikeMacck) March 30, 2016,  9:06: Trump says Lewandowski did not “mislead him. ” He says the video “exonerates him totally. ” Cruz says Fields changed her story when she found out there were security cameras. Trump says the problem is everybody dumps people when there is a “sign of political incorrectness. ” Trump now asks Cooper, “a professional announcer,” to read Fields’s initial statement. “Did she almost fall to the ground?” Trump asks. pic. twitter.   —   Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) March 30, 2016,  Cooper responds: “No, she did not go down to the ground. ” Trump says it would be so easy to “terminate” his campaign manger and ruin his life. He says he has fired many people, especially on the Apprentice.  Trump says Fields was “off base” because she went against the wishes of the Secret Service. He says Fields had a pen in her hand and it could have been “a little bomb. ” 9:05: Cooper asks Trump about Lewandowski. Trump says he will continue as his campaign manager after reviewing the tape. Trump says Wisconsin voters are “shaking their heads  …     gimme a break. ” Trump says Cruz’s home state is Texas though it may be Canada. 9:02: Disturbing image outside GOP town hall in Wisconsin: pic. twitter.   —   Noah Gray CNN (@NoahGrayCNN) March 29, 2016,  9:00: Trump is on deck. 8:52: When asked about how he would ensure there are more qualified manufacturing workers in the U. S. Cruz says we “must reform education” and that is why Common Core must be eliminated. He says he will also abolish the Dept. of Education to   money back to Wisconsin. He also talks up school choice as well (good move in Milwaukee) and says school choice is the “civil rights movement of the 21st century. ” 8:49: Cruz vows there will be accountability in the VA if he is president. He says there needs to be reforms so veterans have the power to choose their own doctors. Cruz tells questioner, who lost his veteran son to an opioid overdose, that he lost his sister to a drug overdose and they are in the same “horrible club. ” 8:45: Questioner asks Cruz what he has done and will do to persuade women to vote for him. Cruz says he has been blessed to have been surrounded by strong women. He says he admires his mom immensely and says she grew up in a   family in Delaware and was the first person in her family to go to college. He says his mother stood up to her father, who thought women should not be educated, and went to Rice and then got hired at Shell as a computer programmer. Cruz says his mother deliberately didn’t learn how to type when a man asked her to type something for him, she could, with a clean conscience, say she didn’t know how to type and so he would have to use her has a computer programmer. He also speaks about Heidi and how he gets upset seeing the “garbage” and “nonsense” she has had to deal with in the business world. 8:42: Cruz is asked how he would protect America while protecting civil liberties. Cruz says “you can walk and chew gum at the same time. ” He says the Obama administration is not good at distinguishing between good guys and bad guys. 8:40: Cruz Now Won’t Commit to Supporting Trump If He’s GOP Nominee: Cruz says he is not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks his   (“should be off limits”). He says he is not an easy person to “tick off” but “when you go after my wife, my daughters, that does it. ” He says he wants the race to be focused on   and “if other candidates don’t, that’s beyond the pale. ” When asked if he would support Trump if he is the nominee, Cruz says he will defeat Trump. He says nominating Trump would be a “train wreck” and it would hand the election to Clinton. Cooper asked him three times. FLASHBACK: During the March 3 debate, Cruz said in response to the same question: “Yes, because I gave my word that I would. I keep my word. ” 8:35: Protesters demonstrating outside of GOP town hall in Wisconsin: Three lines of police hold their position as protestors calmly demonstrate outside #GOPTownHall pic. twitter.   —   Noah Gray CNN (@NoahGrayCNN) March 30, 2016,  8:32: Dairy Farmer asks Cruz about immigration. Cruz says Arizona is spending millions less on   for illegals, which means there are hundreds of millions more to take care of Americans while median wages have gone up for plumbers, carpenters. He says “our immigration laws should benefit American workers. That should be the focus of our immigration laws. ” Cruz cites this Wall Street Journal story: “The Thorny Economics of Illegal Immigration. ” Cruz says in the agricultural industry, the first option should be to find American workers. He says legal immigration should come in when there are not enough American workers to do the job. ”There are farmers across this country who are really hurting,” Cruz tells a Wisconsin dairy farmer, citing govt regulations.  —   Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) March 30, 2016,  8:30: Kasich campaign now slams “Lyin’ Ted. ” Teaming up with Cruz like teaming with a creature from Jurassic World, without the integrity. #NoThanks #Hungreyforshorttermglory #loser,  —   John Weaver (@JWGOP) March 30, 2016,  Lyin’ Ted, on every level. 0 Friends: tells story. 0 Record: tells history. 0 Vision: tells future. 0 chance: tells desperation. #cruzloser,  —   John Weaver (@JWGOP) March 29, 2016,  Lyin’ Ted https:  .   —   Mike Schrimpf (@mike_schrimpf) March 29, 2016,  8:27: Questioner who is leaning towards Cruz asks him whether the   in politics is a good example to be setting for America’s youth. Cruz says he worries about what lessons kids take watching presidential candidates insulting each other, yelling, cursing, attacking family members. Cruz says just when you think it can’t get uglier, it gets uglier. He says he has no ability to control what another candidate does but he promised his supporters that “we’re going to work every day with a joyful spirit” and “we’re going to do so with integrity. ” Cruz says he has worked very hard this election cycle to not go in the gutter and respond in kind when he was personally attacked. He says he hopes that prevails in the end. 8:24: Questioner asks Cruz what he would regard as his greatest personal failure and what he would learn from it. Cruz says those are always “tricky questions. ” Cruz says he is a “pretty driven guy” and that has “pros and cons. ” He says he believes passionately in   principles and he memorized the Constitution as a teenager. He talks about how his father was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba and says it is an amazing thing to grow up in a house with someone who fled oppression. He says there was always an “urgency to politics” because having principled   in office is how you prevent tyranny. Cruz says while growing up in a   household, there were Republicans and Communists. He says his   nature is a “strength and a weakness. ” He says “what you see is what you get though” and “you know what you’re going to get in office. ” Cruz says we need a president voters can trust to follow through in office. 8:17: Questioner asks Cruz if he will send an overwhelming force to send a message to ISIS. Cruz says Obama was not focused on America’s national interest when taking out Qaddafi in Libya. He says as a result, Libya was handed over to radical Islamic terrorists while   were focused on spreading democracy. As Cruz sounds like a Senator, Cooper does a good job of trying to get Cruz to directly answer the question in less than 78 hours. Cruz says America’s focus in Syria should be toppling ISIS and not Assad. Cooper asks Cruz in order to topple ISIS, would he be willing to send ground troops. He says he will do whatever it takes militarily. Cruz cites overwhelming air power. When Cooper asks Cruz about carpet bombing, Cruz says “nobody has talked about targeting civilian areas. ” Cruz just got catty and snide with Anderson Cooper. Not good. He’s not answering the question. He’s just rattling on. Never answered.    —   RealVinnieJames (@RealVinnieJames) March 30, 2016,  8:15: Questioner asks Cruz about the role of religion in   process. Cruz says his faith is an “integral part of who I am. ” He says he is a Christian and isn’t going to hide from that. He says there have been far too many politicians who go around acting like they are “holier than thou. ” Cruz says he is asking voters to vote for him because he has spent a lifetime fighting for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and free enterprise. He says the Bill of Rights protects all religions —  even atheists. He says the   of Rights is a “unifying principle” that can bring Americans of all    together. 8:14: Cruz whines that mainstream media networks have given Trump tons of air time. COOPER POINTS OUT THAT HE HAS ASKED CRUZ FOR INTERVIEWS AND HIS CAMPAIGN HAS REPEATEDLY DECLINED HIS REQUESTS. [Can’t have it both ways.] When Cruz accuses media of showering Trump with free publicity, Anderson Cooper tells Cruz he regularly invites Cruz on and Cruz declines.  —   Teddy Davis (@TeddyDavisCNN) March 30, 2016,  The media totally failed to vet Trump and instead has been providing nothing but fawning, lapdog coverage like this: pic. twitter.   —   Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) March 29, 2016,  8:13: Cooper asks Cruz if he has any proof the Trump campaign planted the story (Rubio allies reportedly shopped the story around for months). Cruz says “of course I do” when Cooper says he doesn’t know for a fact that Trump’s campaign planted the story. 8:12: Cruz says America should “not make the mistakes of Europe” and actively work to stop radical Islamic terrorists. 8:08: When asked about patrolling Muslim neighborhoods, Cruz says there was a “horrific” attack in Brussels and Obama could barely be stopped to say anything about it while at a baseball game with a Communist dictator in Cuba. He slams Obama for not saying the words “radical Islamic terrorism. ” Cruz says Obama just lectures Americans about Islamophobia after terrorist attacks. Cooper keeps pressing Cruz on what it means to patrol Muslim neighborhoods and Cruz keeps trying to buy time. Now he speaks about the difference between Islam and Islamism. Cooper again asks him what he means by his comments re: patrolling Muslim neighborhoods. Cruz says Obama, Clinton, Bratton attacked him for his comments and he wears that criticism as a “badge of honor. ” Cruz says de Blasio gave into political correctness and shut down the NYPD’s Muslim surveillance programs. 8:07: Cruz says a contested convention is possible he will be in a “very strong position” if there is one. 8:05: Cruz says Kasich has no path to winning and his campaign is competing to win and not just to stop Trump. 8:03: Cooper congratulates Cruz for securing Walker’s endorsement. Cruz says he would ask Lewandowski to resign if he were his campaign manager. Cruz says there is no place in politics for physical violence and “going to the gutter. ” Cooper points out that it is “highly improbable” for Cruz to secure 85% of the delegates remaining to secure the nomination. Cruz says when there are two guys in the woods and a bear starts chasing them, you just have to outrun the other guy. Cruz says Trump benefits from “division” because he has a floor of a about 25%. Cruz says Trump will have a difficult time reaching 50% in a    battle with him. 8:02: Each candidate will get an hour at CNN’s town hall event in Milwaukee. Cruz is up first. 8:00: Video of former Miss Wisconsin Thanking Trump for His Support While She Is Battling An Incurable Disease: Here’s the letter she wrote Trump: Read Miss Wisconsin 2005 Melissa Young’s letter to Donald Trump thanking him (she just did it in person) https:  .   —   Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) March 29, 2016,  7:04: Trump says Cruz won the Texas GOP primary only because of “the Great Sarah Palin. ” And then he again says Democrats will sue him if he is the nominee re: eligibility: Trump says Dems will sue Cruz on Canadian birth: ”I think they’re right because he wasn’t born on our soil. He’s not a natural born citizen”  —   Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) March 29, 2016,  Trump holding town hall in Wisconsin: 6:47: Trump says the easiest thing to do would be to say “Corey, you’re fired!” But he says he can’t and then says Fields’s facial expression didn’t change and she didn’t scream. Trump says the video shows Fields didn’t fall to the ground and her statement changed “big league” before she knew she was on tape.

He says the middle class in Wisconsin has been hit “very hard” due to losses in manufacturing jobs. He mentions that Wisconsin has lots tons of jobs to Mexico because of NAFTA and   both want TPP, which will make “NAFTA look like a baby. ” Trump says he is criticizing Walker because he endorsed Cruz.

Trump adds that Walker is a “nice person” but cites the “statistics on what’s happening with jobs” in Wisconsin. Trump says Walker “gave up” and “quit” very early and his “poll numbers went way down” because “his numbers are horrible in Wisconsin. ” 4:41: Trump talks about trade. He says “our jobs are being sucked away. ” He says Walker “went way down” because he gave all of the statistics on how bad Wisconsin’s job environment was and “he couldn’t dispute them. ” 4:38: Trump says he hopes Lewandowski’s role will not change. Trump says people “see what took place” and “it’s so minor. ” Trump said reporters have said the incident was “minor” and it’s a very “sad” day when a “man can be destroyed” over something that “minor. ” Trump reiterates that Fields grabbed him first.  “How could someone be charged for that?” Trump says. 4:35: On his plane before his Janesville rally, Trump claims campaign manger was “maligned. ” Trump: ”If you look at that tape, [Lewandowski] was very very seriously maligned.”  —   Jessica Taylor (@JessicaTaylor) March 29, 2016,  4:29: Rubio Trying to Keep His Delegates from Trump: JUST IN: Rubio trying to keep his delegates from Trump: report https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   The Hill (@thehill) March 29, 2016,  3:58: Cruz to keynote North Dakota GOP Convention: Texas Sen.

Maybe because she is seen as inauthentic, has been on the wrong side of bad trade deals, and trying to make “technical” arguments that Sanders voted against the bailouts reinforces everything that voters hate about the “calculating” Clinton. 10:52: Sanders: “A fantastic night in Michigan. ” He is grateful for all of the support. 10:49: Sanders holds a Miami press conference to thank the people of Michigan for “repudiating the polls” that had the campaign 25 points down and repudiated the pundits who said that “Bernie Sanders isn’t going anywhere. ” He thanks his volunteers. Sanders says tonight showed that his campaign is strong in every part of the country and his strongest states have yet to vote.

Time to grow up.  —   John Nolte (@NolteNC) March 9, 2016,  [Tony Lee: At some point, Trump’s constantly talking about process and having to scratch the itch and refute every negative thing said about him while promoting his holdings gets old. He should leave that up to his surrogates. It will start to wear thin in a general election. Trump still needs to be Trump. Lines like thanking the “lobbyists and special interests” for helping his numbers rise are great. But talking incessantly about polls and process may lead voters to ask, “where’s the beef?” It also makes it seem like he’s just winging it. Once again, Trump missed a huge opportunity to appeal to more Americans and broaden his base of support. Majorities in Mississippi and Michigan, according to exit polls, believed that bad trade deals are destroying American jobs. Trump’s tough talk on trade goes to the core of his appeal. It is also the issue that  may allow him to win a general election against Clinton by attracting   whites and minorities who don’t want to see their jobs shipped overseas. Trump could have used his first minutes of his press conference to talk about trade, American workers and how the GOP can grow the party by championing the issues he has been talking about on the stump. He could have addressed American workers in all communities —    class workers who thought they would have at least the same   lifestyle their parents had, black communities that have been decimated because factories and plants in their communities have closed due to bad trade deals, Americans of Hispanic and Asian descent who are having trouble finding jobs because of illegal immigration, and   Americans of all backgrounds who are worried that cheaper,   foreigners will be brought in to replace them while they are forced to train them. Instead, he spent most of his press conference attacking irrelevant Lindsey Graham, pointing out that Charles Krauthammer finally acknowledged that he did well (why the hell should he care what he thinks?) settling scores with Mitt Romney, blasting bad polls from the Wall Street Journal and incessantly giving       accounts of     minutiae that no regular voter gives a damn about except for someone like Trump who seems obsessed about reading every story written about him (to be fair, Trump’s insatiable appetite for all news about him does make him a better candidate than those whose advisers keep in a bubble because he knows what the political conversation is on any given day. He should keep reading all that is written about him but he seems small when he feels the need to constantly comment on every poll, every criticism, every bad story, etc. ). Trump was all over the map. It’s time for him and his team to start gearing   for the general election. Get   down and stick to them while leaving room for Trump to be Trump on the news of the day to stay in the news and not lose his authenticity. He can wing his way to the GOP nomination. But that act won’t fly in the general election against the   media machine.] 9:50: Meanwhile, none of the networks covered Clinton’s speech. All eyes on Trump —  because you have no idea what he will say unlike traditional politicians whose speeches everyone has memorized by now: Clinton wraps up. not one network popped in for a moment.  —   Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) March 9, 2016,  Apparently, she was targeting ‘Scandal’ viewers: Clinton pushing HARD for the Scandal vote with a Defiance, Ohio reference.  —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) March 9, 2016,  9:41: Trump says that he hears that $39 million has been spent attacking him. He says as he was watching his golf tournament, every negative ad in Florida was about him. Trump says it’s time to unify because we have “something special going on in the Republican Party” where millions of people are voting. He says the Republican elites do not understand what is going on and should “embrace it. ” He says Democrats should love what’s happening. There’s no spirit on the left, he says. Trump blasts “eggheads” in the National Review for not understanding how serious America’s trade deficit with China is. He says he can probably get along with Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney. He says we can unify the party and “nobody’s going to beat us. ” 9:36: Trump says he has nothing to say to Rubio and Rubio will have to decide what the best path for him is going forward. He says hostility works for some people and doesn’t for others. He says he had a good relationship with Marco until the “GOP smart set” convinced him to act like a petulant juvenile and launch inane attacks against Trump on the stump. 9:34: Trump says he has won many club championships and he knows how to close. “Winning is winning. ” Trump says Clinton is a “flawed candidate” and it will be an easy race if Clinton is allowed to run. He says if the government does it job properly, she will not be able to run. 9:30: Trump says politicians will “never get you to the promised land. ” 9:25: Trump says what this election is showing is that advertising is less important than competence. Trump says even Megyn Kelly said “Donald Trump did well tonight. ” Trump: “Thank you, Megyn. ” He says even Charles Krauthammer said so as well. Now Trump is using precious time on all television networks to attack irrelevant Lindsey Graham. He is proud that every single candidate who has attacked him viciously is gone. Now, Trump pivots to ISIS. He says ISIS should not be dictating terms. Trump says Evangelicals don’t like the way Ted talks and Trump talks about how Christianity is being chipped away. Trump says he can win states like New York that Republicans have not been competitive in past elections. He says he will win Michigan. He says for other Republicans, “it’s never even a question. ” He says he will Ohio and Virginia because he has “great properties in Virginia. ” He says having properties in a  state means you love the state and have a lot of employees in the state. 9:12: Trump, again talking about process, says after $38 million worth of lies, he still won. He says it shows how smart the public is. “I want to thank the public,” Trump says before thanking the people of Mississippi and Michigan. Now he touts his friendship with Jack Nicklaus (good play for Ohio —  who knows it was intentional or not). He also recognizes former Yankee Paul O’Neil in the audience. Trump says it is very important that our Senators and Congressmen are   even though not all of them are on his side. Trump says he is happy about turnout. Trump says the biggest story in politics is the huge turnout in GOP primaries with Democrats and Republicans coming over. He says a lot of voter are   voters. He wants to thank the “special interests” and the “lobbyists” because they “obviously did something to drive the numbers. ” Trump wants to thank Paul Ryan. Trump says he could not have been nicer. “Great respect,” he says. He now slams Cruz for saying he is the only one who can beat Donald Trump but “he never beats me. ” Trump says Cruz will have a tough time in the states ahead. He praises Christie for being a “great prosecutor. I watched what he did to Marco. ” Now Trump defends his financials (no debt) and his properties (Trump International, Doral, etc.) Trump is using his press conference to showcase Trump magazine, Trump steaks, Trump water, etc. and ridicules Romney (who claimed Trump steaks and Trump magazine were not around anymore) for attacking his companies. He says he sold his airline. And he defends Trump University. Trump says the press members can take a bottle of wine home if they want. [Here is what Romney read off of his teleprompter last week: “And whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there’s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not. ”] 9:10: Fox News, NBC call Michigan for Trump.  [Tony Lee: Trump recognized how much GOP primary voters despised the political establishment —  and how much immigration and trade mattered —  this election cycle like Obama realized how much   liberals hated George W. Bush   and the Iraq War in 2008. Though the analogy is not perfect, Kasich, in some ways, reminds me of John Edwards in 2004.] 9:05: Step and   bar at Trump’s press conference: There’s also a Trump Step and Repeat pic. twitter.   —   Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) March 9, 2016,  Also an open bar. pic. twitter.   —   Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) March 9, 2016,  9:02: Bad  night for Rubio: This is how poorly Rubio is doing  …    .

He blasts the Koch brothers and a few other “billionaires” to elect candidates who will represent the “rich and the powerful. ” He says “our fight” is to overturn Citizens United and have high voter turnout, end Republican voter suppression. Sanders says let’s show the world on Tuesday that democracy is alive and well with a “YUGE voter turnout. ” He says the plutocrats don’t want young people and   Americans to participate in politics . 7:25: Red meat ready for Trump’s “victory” presser: TRUMP STEAKS, Trump Chardonnay, Trump Rosé and Trump water will be served to guests at Trump’s presser 2nite in FL pic. twitter.   —   Nick Kalman (@NickKalmanFN) March 9, 2016,  Display of @realDonaldTrump wines, steaks  spring water for tonight’s press conference in Jupiter. pic. twitter.   —   George Bennett (@gbennettpost) March 9, 2016,  7:15: GOP grand   Fred Malek opposed to Dump Trump movement: ICYMI: @FredVMalek says he doesn’t agree   the ”Dump Trump” campaign today on #AMR @MSNBC https:  .   —   Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) March 8, 2016,  7:13:   Republicans want brokered convention:    candidates account for 23. 5% of delegates selected so far.

Clinton would also lead against Rubio with 45 percent of the votes against the Florida senator’s 44 percent of the votes. 11:23  —   Trump up 10 points in    Illinois.

I helped launch the #NeverTrump movement with my piece written late two Friday’s ago. That night it got over 60, 000 hits and the #NeverTrump hashtag became a worldwide trend. Credit for the hashtag goes to my friend Aaron Gardner. I’d used #AgainstTrump, the title of the National Reviewcover, but Aaron suggested I change it. What I am seeing at this point, however, is that #NeverTrump is guaranteeing Trump’s nomination because #NeverTrump is really #NeverTed. Many of the most vocal supporters of the #NeverTrump movement are Marco Rubio supporters and they are handing the nomination to Trump because they cannot face the reality of this election.   …     The only way to stop Trump now is to ally with Ted Cruz. But too many of the #NeverTrump brigade are really #NeverTed. They don’t want to look at the math, they don’t want to look at the road ahead, they don’t want Ted Cruz. They’d rather lose with Rubio and stay home in November than ally with Ted Cruz and even have a shot in November. That is genuinely unfortunate and will either guarantee Trump is the nominee or guarantee the Republican Party is destroyed. Marco Rubio, a great man with a struggling campaign, has a cult of personality every bit as committed as Trump’s. The difference is that Rubio’s cult will give us Trump where Trump’s cult alone never could. 10:29  —   Bret Baier: Republicans in DC are saying privately that they’ll vote for Hillary just to keep their power over the party.

That’s the way that democracy works,” Trump said on the program.   8:51  —   Wapo poll: Trump loses to Cruz and Rubio in    race. In hypothetical   matchups, Cruz leads Trump by   percent and Rubio leads Trump by   percent in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates. While the latter lead isn’t statistically significant, both are further signs of the apparent limits to Trump’s popularity within his party. Indeed, among   supporters, seven in 10 say they’d prefer Cruz, and as many say they’d pick Rubio, in    contests.   8:44  —   Wapo poll: National race tightens. Trump 34% Cruz 25%. Trump continues to lead in a new ABC   Post poll, with 34 percent of Republicans and   Independents who are registered to vote saying they’d like to see him win the nomination. But he trails both Cruz and Rubio   . And preferences for Cruz, Rubio and John Kasich have grown as others have left the race, while Trump’s support has essentially remained unchanged for months. In the current   race, 25 percent say they’d like to see Cruz win the nomination, with 18 percent for Rubio and 13 percent for Kasich those are +4, +7 and +11 points compared with January, respectively, to new highs for each. Trump, by contrast, peaked at 38 percent in December.   8:33  —   Is Trump Truly Losing Momentum?

In the battle for the Senate, two of the nine races most likely to decide control have been called, one for Republicans and one a pickup for the Democrats  —   the first of five they will need to win an outright majority. GOP Sen. Marco Rubio won   to his seat in Florida, a race he entered late, only after his presidential campaign faltered. And Tammy Duckworth, the Democratic Illinois congresswoman, defeated incumbent GOP Sen. Mark Kirk in a race that was widely predicted would hand Democrats one of the seats they were looking for. The map for the Senate favored Democrats this year, with all but one of nine seats most likely to decide the balance being held by Republicans. The nine races where a seat is open or most likely to change hands were in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Nevada, Florida and Indiana. Of that group, seven seats belong to Republican incumbents trying to hang on. Only two are open seats, Indiana and Nevada. The only one in Democratic hands presently is Nevada, where Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is retiring. Coming into Tuesday, the House seemed a much safer bet for Republicans  —   and the election night tallies proved true. The GOP held an enormous   advantage coming into Tuesday. The   Cook political report listed 18 seats as pure tossups, not enough to flip control of the chamber to Democrats, even if they ran the table in all of them. 9:45 PM  —   Trump projected to win Louisiana. 9:43 PM  —   Trumpmentum.

On Election Day morning, Real Clear Politics (RCP) listed Virginia as a tossup, though Hillary Clinton led the RCP average of polls by 5 percent, with 47. 2 percent compared to Trump’s 42. 2 percent. In its “no tossup” electoral college map as of Election Day morning, RCP gave Virginia’s 13 electoral college votes to Hillary Clinton. 270 electoral college votes are required to win the presidency.

If either candidate loses the state by less than one percent, a recount is likely. “In Virginia, there are no automatic recounts. Only an apparent losing candidate can ask for a recount, and only if the difference between the apparent winning candidate and that apparent losing candidates is not more than one percent (1%) of the total votes cast for those two candidates,” according to the Virginia Department of Elections website. 7:20 PM  —    7:11 PM  —   CNN calls several Senate races: Rand Paul, Tim Scott  .

Kelly said he met a woman in Clinton Township who tried to vote three different times for Donald Trump, but her vote mysteriously switched to Hillary Clinton each time before the voting machine’s screen went blank. She has no idea if her vote was counted and was very upset by the process. There are 18 different polling sites that have had similar problems taking place, Kelly said. The state party is looking into the discrepancies. If votes are only being flipped one way, “it’s a computer fix, not a computer glitch,” Kelly said. Concerned voters can call the GOP hotline:     Kelly said. Calling the hotline if anything worrying occurs is key, Kelly said, and so is reviewing the vote you cast: Voters “have to look at the [ballot] summary to make sure it’s exactly the way you voted. ” “We’re hearing these things are changing, and it’s all one way,” Kelly said. “You can say, well, maybe it was a computer glitch, but it’s all people voting for Trump. And it’s defaulting to Clinton. ” 6:38 PM  —   O’Keefe says another video imminent. WOW! Caught more #VoterFraud in N Philly.

Trump quoted CNN in a tweet about “voting machine problems” in Utah. The tweet used the word “country” instead of “county,” and the gumshoes at CNN were all over it! Just out according to @CNN: ”Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country”  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2016,  Tapper devoted airtime to set the record straight the chyron during the segment read, “TRUMP TWEET MISTAKENLY ALLEGES NATIONWIDE VOTING ISSUES. ” “The problem is ‘problems across the county.’ A county, not the country, as Mr Trump tweeted,” Tapper said. “It’s the difference of an ‘r’ but kind of an important one. ” Stelter, to do his part, rushed to Twitter to admonish Trump. No. Utah officials reported machine problems across one entire COUNTY, not the entire COUNTRY. https:  .   —   Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) November 8, 2016,  6:33 PM  —     Banner being sung by diverse group of Americans in front of #HiltonMidtown, where   ElectionNight party’s being held pic. twitter.   —   Adelle Nazarian (@AdelleNaz) November 8, 2016,  6:21 PM  —   The Edison Research exit polls, conducted on behalf of a consortium of mainstream media outlets, show that Donald Trump is winning among   educated white voters, 65% to 29%. In 2012, Mitt Romney won the same group  —   but by a lower margin, Politico reports.  Other interesting tidbits mentioned by Politico include that “more voters say Clinton is honest and trustworthy (38 percent) than describe Trump as honest and trustworthy (32 percent). ” It is not clear whether exit polls are accurate  —   and, given Trump voters’ hostility to media and pollsters, they may be even less accurate than usual. Clinton and Trump are splitting   whites, and Clinton is winning younger voters  —   but by lower margins than Obama won them four years ago, according to Politico. 6:20 PM  —   Active shooter situation in California  —   some reports claim it is happening near a polling place.

Mountain Standard Time, and was reported fixed about 3:30 p. m. according to local Denver station Fox 31 and the Secretary of State’s office.  Fox 31 reports: “Unfortunately, our system goes down now and then. It [happened] today and we regret that,” Lynn Bartels, spokeswoman for the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office said on Twitter. The database is used to confirm voter registration. While the system was down, clerks couldn’t process   ballots that needed to have the signature verified and people voting in person voters had to use provisional ballots, according to Bartels.  The news of the crash is likely to fuel speculation of outside tampering or “hacking,” especially given Colorado’s status as an important battleground state, where both campaigns have spent time and resources. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had initially pulled advertising from Colorado, but put resources back into the state as it became more competitive again, and as Republican nominee Donald Trump campaigned there. 5:51 PM  —   The March presidential primary already shattered a   record with 2. 5 million voters.  MLive quotes Johnson saying absentee ballot returns are 18 percent over typical elections. Long lines were reported in Grand Rapids, where Donald Trump made a   campaign stop on Monday, and in Detroit. Detroit polling places reported “disorganization,” ballot outages, and frustrated voters giving up and leaving. One Detroit voter was unable to leave a polling place on the east side of the city, because his hand got stuck in a voting machine. However, Johnson said of overall performance by voting machines: “So far, so good. ” “Things turned heated in Ypsilanti Township, southeast of Ann Arbor, where two voters got into an altercation about their respective candidates. A man ended up shoving one woman, with another woman spitting at people after a group of   people  started to yell,” MLive reports. 5:32 PM  —   STATEWIDE. #Breaking: Statewide election systems down in Colorado, delaying voters.

Madonna has withdrawn from her pledge to provide some, er, satisfaction to Hillary voters, the latest disappointment in an election season full of them. The singer had famously promised the oral sex last month  —   “And I am good,” she added, lest anyone question her gratification qualifications  —   but when a Hillary supporter, armed with a selfie of his ballot, showed up to claim the prize, he was greeted with derision. “Ha ha ha ha,” laughed the security guard at her Madgesty’s Upper East Side manse. “I didn’t get that information, sorry, man. ” He then hung up, leaving a reporter with the ultimate hanging chad.

A majority also feel that the economy is rigged to mostly help the wealthy.  The poll, which will be updated as additional responses are tallied and votes are counted throughout Tuesday, found:  —   75 percent agree that “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful. ”  —   72 percent agree “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful. ”  —   68 percent agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me. ”  —   76 percent believe “the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth. ” Read the rest of the story at Reuters. com. 4:41 PM  —   “We’re very excited.

The CNN correspondent on the scene asked the couple whether they got along and asked both of them why they supported either candidate. After Jackie explained that she trusts Trump to be a strong leader and stop America from owing other countries, the reporter implied that she should support Clinton because of her gender. “Aren’t you excited for the first female president?” he asked. Krachala simply replied, “No!” Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by three percentage points on Election Day, according to RealClearPolitics. 4:09 PM  —   Reports out of Philly say that Republican poll watchers have been thrown out of polling places throughout the City of Brotherly Love. Local Republicans have taken to social media @PhillyGOP to share their accounts with the nation in  .  A small sampling of these tweets (with “minority inspector” referring to Republican inspectors) just from the morning hours of Election Day include: Most of these tweets were tagged with #VoterFraud. Political analysts sometimes say that Pennsylvania is “Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Alabama,” meaning that there are two Democratic strongholds in the Keystone State, surrounded by vast expanses of   support for limited government, faith, marriage, and the Second Amendment. Philadelphia is nothing short of notorious for voter fraud. One of the most infamous examples of   violations in modern history was when The Justice Department secured a court judgment against the Black Panthers for a videotaped incident of voter intimidation, a case that after the government won but before enforcement could take place, Barack Obama’s   Attorney General Eric Holder to drop the case and let the Black Panthers go. Some polls are split regarding whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is likely to win Pennsylvania, with Republicans complaining that voter fraud is so rampant in Philadelphia that it could steal a victory from Donald Trump if the margin is close. Trump has been pounding away on the theme that aspects of the system are “rigged” urging his supporters to turn out in massive numbers to ensure victory when the polls close.

Bush and Laura Bush voted for Hillary Clinton today,” the Washington Examiner reports.   “On one level, it’s personal. Remember what Trump said about Jeb. And Trump has had some unkind things to say about George W. Bush,” Limbaugh explained, referencing Donald Trump’s habit during the Republican primary of calling Jeb Bush “low energy. ”   “But aside from that, think about party loyalty, think about issues, think about the direction of the country,” Limbaugh added. “How does anybody vote for Hillary Clinton?” Limbaugh issued a stern warning to the “elites in Washington and New York,” members of the “club” of powerful,   political and media figures. “I submit to you that if you’re in the club, and by the club I mean the establishment, if you are among the few elites in Washington and New York that actually, for lack of a better term, run the country, you’re going to hang together with other club members,” Limbaugh said. “That’s how I think this happens. ” “Hillary Clinton’s not seen as a Democrat  …     She may be, on one intramural level, an opponent, but she’s certainly not an enemy when somebody outside the club happens to be running,” Limbaugh continued. “Members of the club   …     they’re going to hang together to preserve the existence of the club and its exclusivity. ” Although as many as 50 former George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush administration appointees coming out in support of Trump, there were reports earlier this year that George W. Bush would vote for Hillary Clinton.  3:50 PM  —   SYMBOLISM.

Voters who get in line before the polling locations’ closing times are allowed to vote, but the Trump campaign’s lawsuit alleges poll workers at the direction of Gloria allowed people who did not get in the line before the polls had closed. Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston described one of the locations in a Politico article published before the lawsuit. The line Friday evening stretched outside Cardenas Market in Las Vegas, teeming with Hispanic voters eager to cast ballots. Many had to wait for hours on the last day of a fortnight of early voting in Nevada, plied by food and exhortations from activists who didn’t have to do much. Election officials had to keep the polling place open an extra three hours to accommodate the line, which was described thusly on Twitter by Yvanna Cancela, the political director for the majority Hispanic Culinary union: “Looks like Trump got his wall after all.

The RealClearPolitics average of Florida polls currently shows Trump with a . 2% lead, well within the margin of error for virtually all polls. 1:27 PM  —   The error was due to a calibration issue in Lebanon County’s voting machines, where five machines out of the 270 machines available in the county malfunctioned, Penn Live reported.  Voters saw the errors after they reviewed their ballots before officially filing them. When questioned about the issue, no one reported their votes were incorrectly cast, according to Lebanon County Election Director Michael Anderson. Anderson said the issue was fixed and there was no indication that anyone’s votes were incorrectly registered in the system. Other states have also reported problems with their voting machines on Election Day.

More than   (36 percent) of 2016 voters said being a strong leader was the most important quality when picking a president, compared with 18 percent of voters who said the same during 2012 election. It’s an opinion held regardless of partisan leanings: 35 percent of Democrats, 34 percent of independents and 39 percent of Republicans said that was most important.  After being a strong leader, voters said having a vision for the future, at 29 percent, was most important. Sixteen percent picked having a candidate share their values and care about people like them, respectively. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to place more value in whether the candidate cares about them (20 percent to 12 percent) while GOP voters said it was more important that the candidate shares their values (19 percent to 14 percent). Morning Consult, which was founded in 2013, is considered the “breakout” polling company of the 2016 election. 1:02 PM  —   “  turnout is looking much higher than expected,” Luntz tweeted.

Hillary Clinton has maintained an edge in Michigan polling heading into Election Day, with the RealClearPolitics polling average putting her 3. 4 percentage points above Trump  —   within most polls’ margins of error. An   survey published by the Trafalgar Group showed Trump up two points. Michigan native Michael Moore warned his progressive followers last week that polls showing Clinton ahead were not a guarantee that she would win the state  —   as Sen.

Trump has made an appeal to   voters with a promise to revitalize U. S. manufacturing through better trade deals, attacking Clinton over the legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and her early support of the   Partnership (TPP). In an ironic moment, Moore  —   famous for his film Roger  Me about the closing of a General Motors plant in Flint, MI  —   inadvertently created a viral ad explaining the reason many   voters are supporting Trump. An excerpt of his film TrumpLand, where he discusses Trump’s   appeal, received millions of views as Trump supporters set it to dramatic music and images.  12:26 PM  —    12:04 PM  —   Pence lives and votes in Indianapolis as he lives at the Indiana governor’s mansion.

So risk of a polling error  —   in either direction  —   is higher than usual. pic. twitter.   —   Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 8, 2016,  One out of eight voters, or 12. 5 percent, are either undecided or declaring support for other candidates during the last few days of the election. That is up from one out of 32 voters in 2012, one out of 27 voters in 2004, and one out of 10 voters in 2000, when Texas Gov. George W. Bush barely beat Vice President Al Gore. So Silver is cautioning people to be ready for a major failure by the pollsters in predicting Americans’   choices. Clinton is likely to win, said Silver, but: 3) Basically, these 3 cases are equally likely, a —  Solid Clinton win, b —  Epic Clinton blowout, c —  Close call, Trump *probably* wins Elect. Coll. If the polls understate Trump’s support by three percent by a uniform margin of three percent, Clinton still wins, although just barely, Silver said.  However, in a prior tweet, Silver noted that Trump is doing much better than 2012 Republican candidate Gov. Mitt Romney in the midwestern states, where he may be able to pick up wins that would give him 270 Electoral votes. But mostly it’s the Electoral College. Clinton underperforming Obama’s 2012 forecast by *4 points* in the Midwest. That’s a major liability. pic. twitter.   —   Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 7, 2016,  Other evidence, described by Breitbart here and here, suggest that the 2016 polls are less reliable predictors than prior years’ of the final presidential vote. Also,   support for Clinton may be sharply down from support for President Barack Obama in 2016. 11:41 AM  —   He went on to claim the organisation had no political bias against Hillary Clinton but could not “publish information we do not have” on the campaigns of Donald Trump and   candidates.  Assange added that the policy position he has supported is that of Green Party candidate Jill Stein, as she has expressed desire to protect whistleblowers and maintained that WikiLeaks’ work should be explicitly protected by the First Amendment. You can read the full statement below: “In recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself. That pressure has come from the campaign’s allies, including the Obama administration, and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected US President. On the eve of the election, it is important to restate why we have published what we have. The right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of WikiLeaks  —   an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself. Our organization defends the public’s right to be informed. This is why, irrespective of the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election, the real victor is the US public which is better informed as a result of our work. The US public has thoroughly engaged with WikiLeaks’ election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents. Millions of Americans have poured over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us. It is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the First Amendment. We publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish. We had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the Sanders and Clinton campaign (DNC Leaks) and the Clinton political campaign and Foundation (Podesta Emails).   disputes the public importance of these publications. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election. At the same time, we cannot publish what we do not have. To date, we have not received information on Donald Trump’s campaign, or Jill Stein’s campaign, or Gary Johnson’s campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria. As a result of publishing Clinton’s cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us. We publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it. That is our commitment to ourselves, to our sources, and to the public. This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers. I spoke at the launch of the campaign for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, because her platform addresses the need to protect them. This is an issue that is close to my heart because of the Obama administration’s inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources, Chelsea Manning. But WikiLeaks publications are not an attempt to get Jill Stein elected or to take revenge over Ms Manning’s treatment either. Publishing is what we do. To withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the public’s right to know. This is after all what happened when the New York Times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the US population for a year until after the 2004 election, denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president George W Bush, which probably secured his reelection. The current editor of the New York Times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so. The US public defends free speech more passionately, but the First Amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise. The First Amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyone’s ability to speak and publish freely. The First Amendment does not privilege old media, with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions, over WikiLeaks’ model of scientific journalism or an individual’s decision to inform their friends on social media. The First Amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge. With the Internet, it has reached its full potential. Yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clinton’s main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications —  because none exists. In the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  —   a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate. WikiLeaks’   pristine record for authentication remains. Our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them. We have endured intense criticism, primarily from Clinton supporters, for our publications. Many   supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about Wikileaks’ motivation or sources. Ultimately, however, if WL reacted to every false claim, we would have to divert resources from our primary work. WikiLeaks, like all publishers, is ultimately accountable to its funders. Those funders are you. Our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales. This allows us to be principled, independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is. But it also means that we do not have the resources of CNN, MSNBC or the Clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism. Yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public, we are no longer talking about a free press, and we are no longer talking about an informed public. Wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it. WikiLeaks must publish. It must publish and be damned. 11:29 AM  —   WABC, an ABC affiliate, reports the two women were arrested.

If those two measures pass, half of all Americans would live in states that have such expanded checks. Eighteen states and Washington, D. C. have already approved similar laws. (Graphic: Gun issues on the ballot here) Voters in Washington state, meanwhile, will consider allowing judges to bar people from possessing guns if they pose a danger to themselves or to others, such as accused domestic abusers. In California, a referendum would ban   ammunition magazines and require certain people to pass a background check to buy ammunition.

These   voters are proud to have the first word on the big vote.  Clinton won more votes in Dixville and Hart’s Location, but Trump was the overwhelming favorite in Millsfield, with a   edge. Libertarian Gary Johnson picked up three votes. Bernie Sanders, John Kasich and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney got   votes. Under New Hampshire state law, communities with fewer than 100 voters can get permission to open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. 10:08 AM  —   From the New York Post:  Moody’s Analytics, which has picked the next president every year since 1980, says Clinton will make history as the first female chief executive, trouncing Trump with 332 electoral votes. That runs in sharp contrast to a model created by Helmut Norpoth, a political science professor at Stony Brook University, that’s predicting Trump will be running the country. Norpoth is sticking by the results of his model  —   which has correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1912, with the exception of 2000  —   despite most polls showing Clinton ahead by at least 3 percentage points. “If [Clinton] was leading by 10 or 20 points, I would say this is not going to be my year, but I don’t see it,” he told The Post. “It’s so close. It’s certainly   [for him] even when you look at the polls. ” Read the rest of the story here. 9:54 AM  —    9:47 AM  —    . @HillaryClinton walks in to cast her vote at an election center in Chappaqua, New York. #ElectionDay #FoxNews2016 (VIDEO: @JakeBGibson) pic. twitter.   —   Fox News (@FoxNews) November 8, 2016,  9:40 AM  —   Early, early line at a Texas polling station  —   and a black Trump supporter making sure to represent him at the polls in   Philadelphia.

       "        <td>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HOLDS A NEWS CONFERENCE TO, ANNOUNCE HIS NEW NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF LABOR,   FEBRUARY 16, 2017,   SPEAKER: PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP,   [*] TRUMP: Thank you very much.   I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He’s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed did very, very well.   And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he’s going to be    I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of labor.   And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition.   Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the   or as they say, ”never Trump.” And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support. And it’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time. It’s very, very important to me.   So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.   I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions. And I had this time. We’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we’ve done some really good work. We’re very proud of that.   And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we’ll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That’s always a possibility.   I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done.   A new Rasmussen poll, in fact    because the people get it    much of the media doesn’t get it. They actually get it, but they don’t write it. Let’s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is    to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ”Oh, that’s good.” Now it means, ”That’s good for jobs.” Very different.   Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league    Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I’m making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit    a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not, and that’s OK, too.   TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D. C. along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.   I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking    and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure we’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort   not all the time   and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say   they’re honest and fantastic.   But much of it is not a   the distortion    and we’ll talk about it, you’ll be able to ask me questions about it. But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country you see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The middle east is a disaster. North Korea   we’ll take care of it folks we’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.   Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you’ve covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand.   We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He’s over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it’s in large sections of the world.   They’ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer   another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism, and we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now, it’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I’ve ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I’ve had great from Congress, generally.   We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my   I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it’s depleted   it won’t be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I’m standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.   We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders.   Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons.   And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222, 230’s impossible.   270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before so that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media’s trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason.   And   but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida five o’clock on Saturday and I heard   just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T. V. open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved.   And they’re outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who’s there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague   highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We’re waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about and we can’t let that happen.   So, if the Democrats who have   all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.   I’ll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks   in the weeks coming. We’ve withdrawn from the   disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We’re going to make trade deals but we’re going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We’re going to have one on one deals.   We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it’s many, many years. And then at the end of the process    they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.   Now, they may be rejected with me but it’s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it’s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries. We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on   federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.   We’ve issued a   new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody’s ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say ”let me see your regulations” and they’re fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental   all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.   We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation    take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible.   We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer.   We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general    now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either   or a joke.   We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.   The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order.   I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.   In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is    that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.   We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that.   TRUMP: And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D. C. I’ve started by imposing a   lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.   We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is’s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.   So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It’s already happening. But big league.   I’ve also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.   You look at Rex Tillerson. He’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.   Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.   Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.   Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.   Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2, 000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here.   General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.   Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10, 000 American jobs.   Walmart announced it will create 10, 000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we’re naming.   Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades    decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.   And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he’ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the   way, and he should get those votes.   This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week.   Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p. m. I hope to see you there.   And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions.   Mara (ph) Mara (ph) go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.   QUESTION: ( )   TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.   He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong    what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem.   And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this    that they know nothing about it they weren’t in Russia they never made a phone call to Russia they never received a phone call.   It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal    I think it’s very important    the illegal, giving out classified information. It was    and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.   I’ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that’s    I spoke to the president of Mexico I had a good call. All of a sudden, it’s out there for the world to see. It’s supposed to be secret. It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.   Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I’m saying    the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it?   You know why? Because it’s an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.   Yes, go ahead.   QUESTION: ( )   TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, ”I don’t think he did anything wrong if anything, he did something right.” He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, ”Huh, that’s fine.” That’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to    he didn’t just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were    countries. He’s doing the job.   You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.   But he didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.   Yes?   QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long   story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was    it’s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren’t even a part, really    I mean, they were such a minor part. They    I hadn’t spoken to them.   I think the one person    I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very   member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.   The other person said he never spoke to Russia never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That’s what he does. I mean, people know that.   That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s    by the way, who’s by the way a respected man. He’s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody    people knew that. Everybody knew that.   So, these people    and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories.   TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.   He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that’s the extent.   Russia is fake news. Russia    this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.   As you know, Mike Pompeo has    has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.   And just while you’re at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time’s story, yesterday. And it talked about    these are (ph) front page.   So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.   So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.   But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?   That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.   And it was totally    they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.   OK, go ahead.   QUESTION: ( ) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph) or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 ( ).   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: Yeah.   QUESTION: Obama ( ) 426 on ( ). So why should Americans. ..   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: . ..I’m skipping that information, I don’t know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin.   QUESTION: ( ) why should Americans trust you ( ) the information ( )?   TRUMP: Well, I don’t know, I was given that information. I was given    I actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that’s. ..   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes?   QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did    whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?      what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.   TRUMP: We are.   QUESTION: Can we ask what you’re going to do and also, we’ve heard about a    a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?   TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they’re in position so I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.   The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he’s offered his services and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of. But I don’t think we’re need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.   As far as the general’s concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong, you know, really didn’t think.   It was really, what happened after that but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said ”well I don’t see”    to me, he was doing the job.   The information was provided by    who I don’t know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said ”doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there.” But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as    as far as the actual making the call, fact I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job.   That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So    and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man.   QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks    on the leaks, sir. ..   TRUMP: . ..Go ahead. Finish off then I’ll get you.   QUESTION: I’m sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You’ve said twice today. ..   TRUMP: . ..Yes, we’re looking at them very    very, very serious. I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we’re    I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They’re put out by people either in agencies    I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate.   We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act. You know what I say, when I    when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment    when I was called out on Mexico, I was    honestly, I was really, really surprised.   But I said ”you know, it doesn’t make sense. That won’t happen” but that wasn’t that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who’s a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said ”that’s terrible that it was leaked” but it wasn’t that important. But then I said to myself ”what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?”   What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very    you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don’t want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.   So I’m dealing with Mexico, I’m dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the ”Washington Post” and gets put into the ”New York Times” and I’m saying ”what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East? What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?   We got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty.   QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?   TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do    and I hope we can correct it. Because there’s nobody I have more respect for    well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.   It’s very important to me and especially in this position. It’s very important. I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true and, you know, over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m OK with that. But I’m not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.   I don’t watch it any more because it’s very good    he’s saying no. It’s OK, Jim (ph). It’s OK, Jim (ph) you’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one so don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be    I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now but I think that actually    I think that’d actually be better.   People    I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know, Peter (ph) is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower    I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I’d appreciate it    again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.   TRUMP: I think we’re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I’m looking, some of them had them approved immediately.   I’m going forever and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for. And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they’d be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody’s good.   And sometimes    I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that’s OK. That’s fine. But I think it would    I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics.   And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.   QUESTION: ( )   TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information. They’re giving stuff    what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.   Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine    seriously    can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric    you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We’ll do you next Jim, I do you next( ph).   QUESTION: ( ) clarify      TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure,   QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador      TRUMP: No, I didn’t.   QUESTION:    prior to your    TRUMP: No, I didn’t.   QUESTION:    inauguration.   TRUMP: No, I didn’t.   QUESTION: And then fired him      TRUMP: Excuse me.   QUESTION: ( )   TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.   I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. And it came out that way    and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I’ve watched many other people say that.   No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it. OK? Jim?   QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don’t hate you. I don’t hate you.   TRUMP: OK.   QUESTION: So, pass that along      TRUMP: Ask    ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. OK?   QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir      TRUMP: Well, that’s    well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.   QUESTION: It’s pretty good right now, actually.   TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John.   QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time      TRUMP: I was OK with it.   QUESTION:    you said    you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30, 000  . I’m wondering, sir, if you    TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.   QUESTION: Then( ph) your( ph) numbers( ph) were off too.   TRUMP: No    no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that.   QUESTION: If    if I may ask you, sir, it    it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during( ph) the campaign      TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready?   QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that      TRUMP: No    no, but let me do one at a time.   QUESTION: If I may as a follow up?   TRUMP: Do you mind?   QUESTION: Yes, sir.   TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you’re talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.   He said terrible things about her. But it wasn’t classified information. But in one case, you’re talking about classified    regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong    at my suggestion    and I give Reince great credit for this    at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.   I don’t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so    they were    when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn’t even in the papers.   Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she    and she should have reported herself.   Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, ”I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job.” QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don’t understand. It seems that there’s a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?   TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look. ..   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: You know what it is? Here’s the thing. The public isn’t    you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved. I’m involved. I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life. But I’m involved. So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not. I just see many, many untruthful things.   And I’ll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word ”tone.” The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such    I do get good ratings, you have to admit that    the tone is such hatred.   I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox  Friends in the morning, they’re very honorable people. They’re very    not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That’s all I can say. It’s the most honest.   But the tone, Jim. If you look    the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes    sometimes somebody gets. ..   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive  . The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive  . And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth the hatred coming from other people on your network.   Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I’m amazed by it. And I just think you’d be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know.   I    I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s    it’s brutal.   Now, they’ll take this news conference    I’m actually having a very good time, OK? But they’ll take this news conference    don’t forget, that’s the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: No, that’s how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people. That’s for sure. But I’m having a good time.   Tomorrow, they will say, ”Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.” I’m not ranting and raving. I’m just telling you. You know, you’re dishonest people. But    but I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it.   But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, ”Donald Trump rants and raves.” I’m not ranting and raving.   Go ahead.   QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup. ..   TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have    let him have a little bit more?   Sit down. Sit down. We’ll. ..   (CROSSTALK)   QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir. ..   TRUMP: I’m changing it from fake news, though.   QUESTION: Doesn’t that under. ..   TRUMP: Very fake news.   QUESTION: . .. I know, but aren’t you. ..   (LAUGHTER)   TRUMP: Go ahead.   QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news.   TRUMP: And you’re not related to our new. ..   QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.   TRUMP: I looked    you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.   QUESTION: I’m sure you checked that out, sir.   TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it    I said    they said, ”No, sir.” I said, ”Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.”   QUESTION: But aren’t you    aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don’t like ”fake news”? Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like.   TRUMP: I do that.   QUESTION: When you call it ”fake news,” you’re undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important.   TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here’s the thing. OK. I understand what you’re    and you’re right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I’ll say, ”Wow, that’s going to be a great story.” And I’ll get killed.   I know what’s good and bad. I’d be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what’s good. I know what’s bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive    sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make OK. They’ll even make it negative.   So I understand it. So, because I’m there. I know what was said. I know who’s saying it. I’m there. So it’s very important to me.   Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press    the public doesn’t believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?   Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go   as an example, you’re CNN, I mean it’s story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running   this is a   machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).   You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I’m saying ”here’s my chief of staff,” a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right?   We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some   all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job. And I said to myself, you know   and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said ”you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.” I mean, they’re fake. They’re not true. And isn’t that a shame because he’d rather be working on healthcare, he’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph).   I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there’s a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know   you know, whatever reason. But   and I understand that. But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair and that’s why the public sees it. They see it. They see it’s not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.   And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead.   QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news? And second. ..   TRUMP: . ..I think they don’t believe it. I don’t think the public   that’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don’t think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that’s a ruse. That’s a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.   Now tomorrow, you’ll say ”Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.” It’s not terrible. It’s good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.   Nobody talks about that. I didn’t do anything for Russia. I’ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?   Hillary Clinton   that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who’s going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said ”I know politically it’s probably not good for me.” The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles off shore right out of the water.   Everyone in this country’s going to say ”oh, it’s so great.” That’s not great. That’s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you’ve had a lot of presidents that haven’t taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can   now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But   but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin.   Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said ”you know.” He’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying ”you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It’s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story.” OK?   And that’s a shame because if we could get along with Russia   and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.   QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)?   QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you. ..   TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We’re doing Obamacare. We’re in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It’s not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.   So we’ll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March,   March. And after that, we’re going to come up, and we’re doing very well on tax reform.   Yes?   QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.   TRUMP: OK.   QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel    the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.   TRUMP: Not good.   QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries and a Russian plane buzzed a U. S. destroyer.   TRUMP: Not good.   QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign . ..   TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, ”Hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States there’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us.” Because the    you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, ”Oh, isn’t that wonderful.” But I know you well enough.   Then you would say, ”Oh, he was too tough he shouldn’t have done that.” Look, all of the. ..   (CROSSTALK)   QUESTION: I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those. ..   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a  . It failed. They all tried. But I’m different than those people.   Go ahead.   QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?   TRUMP: I have. I have. And I’m so beautifully represented. I’m so honored that the Senate approved him. He’s going to be fantastic.   Yes, I think that I’ve already. ..   QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?   TRUMP: No, I don’t think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now.   Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal.   Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal. I don’t know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough    the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.   If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along    and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There’s no  . We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.   They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.   QUESTION: So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are. ..   TRUMP: Who did I say is not good?   QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they’re not good.   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: No, it’s not good, but they happened.   QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine. ..   TRUMP: They all happened recently.   No. ..   (CROSSTALK)   QUESTION: . .. this country’s ability to work with Russia?   TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they’re doing because they’re doing the same thing.   Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK?   But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the  . She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia.   QUESTION: Can we. ..   TRUMP: I gave    you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.   QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?   TRUMP: I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don’t talk about military response. I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months. ”We are going to attack Mosul in four months.” Then three months later, ”We are going to attack Mosul in one month.” ”Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.”   In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things, you’re going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that. So I don’t have to tell you. I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, ”Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.” I don’t have to do that. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn’t know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.   TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I’m not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything, but I’m not going to tell you.   OK.   QUESTION: Could I just ask you    thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble. ..   TRUMP: Where are you from?   QUESTION: BBC.   TRUMP: Here’s another beauty.   QUESTION: That’s a good line. Impartial, free and fair.   TRUMP: Yeah. Sure.   QUESTION: Mr. President. ..   TRUMP: Just like CNN right?   QUESTION: On the travel ban    we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government. ..   TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government. ..   QUESTION: Were there any mistakes. ..   TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.   Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that’s been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it’s 80 percent of the time, a lot.   We had a bad decision. We’re going to keep going with that decision. We’re going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.   That’s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.   Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.   Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a   period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.   You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that’s like you. You have some bad people out there.   Kelly said you can’t do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don’t have time to come in.   Now nobody ever reports that. But that’s why we did it quickly.   Now, if I would’ve done it a month, everything would’ve been perfect. The problem is we would’ve wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would’ve come into our country.   Now in the meantime, we’re vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed.   QUESTION: Just a brief  . But if it’s so urgent, why not introduce. ..   TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead.   QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?   TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that’s one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been.   QUESTION: During the election?   TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody. ..   QUESTION: So you’re not aware of any contact during the course..   TRUMP: Look, look, look. ..   QUESTION: . .. of the election?   TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?   QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.   I know you have to get up and ask a question. It’s so important.   Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn’t. I just have nobody to speak to.   I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.   We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk.   I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.   Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that    whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.   QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?   TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he    now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right?   He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.   QUESTION: Mr. President. ..   TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks?   QUESTION: Mr. President. ..   TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five?   QUESTION: Mr. President, on national. ..   TRUMP: Wait. Let’s see. Who’s    I want to find a friendly reporter.   QUESTION: Mr. ...   TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead.   QUESTION: ( ). ..   TRUMP: Go ahead.   QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven’t seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the    anyone on your staff of being ( ).   Because ( ). However, what we’ve already heard about and what we ( ) is ( ) so you’re general forecast (ph) like 48 ( ). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the ( ). ..   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP:. ..he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it’s not, its not, not    not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question.   So here’s the story, folks. Number one, I am the least   Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican    quiet, quiet, quiet.   See, he lied about    he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.   I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it.   So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.   QUESTION: Thank you, I’m Lisa (ph) from the. ..   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is.   QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines?   TRUMP: Yeah.   QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific. ..   TRUMP: It’s a very fair question.   QUESTION: . ..countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.   TRUMP: Right.   QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?   TRUMP: We’re gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.   In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way    it’s a very    it’s a very, very tough subject.   We’re gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is    is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.   But the DACA situation is a very, very    it’s a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.   I’m not talking about new laws, I’m talking the existing law, is very rough, it’s very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.   But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we’re tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.   And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK?   QUESTION: Mr. President. ..   (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..reopening of the White House Visitors Office?   TRUMP: Yes.   QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what’s first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean. ..   TRUMP: Now, that’s what I call a nice question. That is very    who are you with?   QUESTION: ( )   TRUMP: Good, I’m gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania’s terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.   And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania’s gonna be outstanding, that’s right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.   She, like others that she’s working with, feel very, very strongly about women’s issue, women’s difficulties. Very, very strongly, she’s a very, very strong advocate. I think she’s a great representative for this country.   And a funny thing happens, because she gets    she gets so unfairly    Melania, the things they say. I’ve known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well.   She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find. And the things they say    I’ve known her for a long time    the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.   I’ll just tell you this. I think she’s going to be a fantastic first lady. She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they’re not doing this for money.   They’re not doing this for pay, they’re doing this because they feel it both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school    because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left    she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that’s a very nice question.   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump?   TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that’s OK.   QUESTION: It doesn’t( ph) have( ph) to be a bad question.   TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.   QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you’re      TRUMP: Fix the inner cities.   QUESTION:    president. Fixing the inner cities.   TRUMP: Yep.   QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that’s coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn’t bad, was it?   TRUMP: That was very professional and very good.   QUESTION: I’m very professional.   TRUMP: We’ll be announcing the order in a little while and I’d rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.   I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.   And by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible    you know, it takes a long time.   It’s taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we’re going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we’re going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.   You go to some of these inner city places and it’s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people    and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it    in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.   They’re living in hell. We can’t let that happen. So, we’re going to be very, very strong. That’s a great question and    and it’s a    it’s a very difficult situation because it’s been many, many years. It’s been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix.   We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know.   There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all    and safe. There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.   I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK?   QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going    are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your    your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as      TRUMP: Am I going to include who?   QUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional      TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?   QUESTION:    Hispanic Caucus      TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting?   QUESTION: No    no    no. I’m not      TRUMP: Are they friends of yours?   QUESTION: I’m just a reporter.   TRUMP: Well, then( ph) set up the meeting.   QUESTION: I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now.   TRUMP: Let’s go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it’s great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it’s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically. I can’t have that meeting.   I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.   QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.   TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can’t make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told   he was probably told ”don’t meet with Trump. It’s bad politics.”   And that’s part of the problem in this country. OK, one more.   QUESTION: (inaudible)   TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can’t handle. This room can’t handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.   QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible) some of it by supporters in your name. What do you. ..   TRUMP: . ..And some of it   can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side and you think it’s like playing it straight?   No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won’t be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.   (CROSSTALK)   TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead.   QUESTION: You’re the president now. What are you going to do about it?   TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that?   QUESTION: What are you going to do about   what are you going to do about (inaudible).   TRUMP: Oh, I’m working on it. I’m working on it very   no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided   I didn’t come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.   We’re going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that’s part of it. But we’re going to work on education, we’re going to work on   you know, we’re going to stop   we’re going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we’re going to try and stop crime.   We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime. But it’s very important to me   but this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try   I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much.   It’s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks.</td>\n",

He says it has been a great night for Trump. And he points out that Rubio has been the donor class “favorite” and has won zero primaries and one contest. He says Rubio is “falling apart before our very eyes” and “that is a very significant development tonight. ” Miller says it’s remarkable that Trump is on his way to the nomination while fighting the donor class and the power brokers every step of the way. “Historic achievement,” Miller says. “That is a remarkable thing. ” Miller says Rubio’s attacks are hurting Rubio. But he says the establishment machine still has considerable power and that is why   are not as supportive of Trump. Miller says we cannot overlook the fact Trump is in a strong position and just how “badly wounded  ” Senator Rubio is going into Florida.

Trump says he thinks he will win before the convention. 11:15: Trump says he wants to be a more presidential candidate than Lincoln. He says he can’t just sit back and take incoming without attacking back and “I will do it for our country. ” [Tony Lee: Again, Trump shows good instincts by saying he will fight for America like he has been brawling for himself. But he needs to put these messages together in a  better way so they cut through the filter. Trump’s challenge in the general election will be to be the “sensitive jackass. ”] Answering another question, Trump says “Any hate group —  no good with Donald Trump,” Trump says. 11:14: CNN reporter gets booed when asking about Trump’s  .

He says he has never seen any human being hit with more negative commercials like he is being hit with. But despite that, he says he has a “tremendous lead in Florida. ” Trump says the biggest story is the tremendous outpouring of voters coming into the GOP. Cruz says he is honored to say that if he were not involved, that would not be happening. “We have a dynamic party. And as a party, we should come together and stop this foolishness,” Trump says. Trump says he is not the “establishment” because he can’t be controlled. Trump says if the establishment runs a   candidate, that means that Clinton is going to appoint “very, very, very liberal judges. ” Trump says he is the only one who can beat Clinton —  “if she is allowed to run. ” Trump says I am the one person, “trust me,” that she does not want to run against. 10:54: Trump says Rubio should drop out of the race. “I think it’s time he drops out. ” Trump says he would love to take on Cruz in an    matchup. “I want Ted  ” he says. 10:52: Trump says he has been in competitions all his life and there is nothing more exciting than “this stuff. ” “There’s nothing like this,” he says. “It’s really exciting stuff. ” He thanks the people of Louisiana and the people of Kentucky for an “amazing relationship. ” He says he won Kentucky even though Sen.

His losses there may be blessings in disguise. Trump won’t be able to defeat Clinton by winging it though he can win the GOP nomination by making it up as he goes along. If Trump really fears being branded by history as a “loser,” he must up his game in the weeks ahead to not only lock up the nomination but to train himself for the general election. Trump and his campaign need to anticipate   in advance that the media will use to trip him up and have disciplined answers at the ready. He needs to be more strategic. He has to understand the arguments being made against him on the right and the left and have counterarguments ready. Right now, Trump, who should be given credit for performing so well even though he has never run for anything before, is like a baseball hurler with unlimited talent who is just getting by because he can naturally throw gas. He’s a thrower right now. He needs to become a pitcher to beat Clinton.] 10:00: Scene at Trump’s news conference: View from front row of press section at tonight’s Trump press conference pic. twitter.   —   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) March 6, 2016,  Donald Trump just popped into his own press conference and then left.

Amazing.  —   daveweigel (@daveweigel) March 6, 2016,  9:33: More talk about Trump’s ceiling: ”He’s got a hard ceiling of  %,” Cruz says of Trump, currently at 47% in Louisiana,  —   Brett LoGiurato (@BrettLoGiurato) March 6, 2016,  9:32: Clinton, to be fair, does have trouble speaking in front of a microphone (she speaks to the room like she doesn’t have a microphone in front of her and has to shout, shout, shout): MSNBC criticizing Hillary’s vocal style.

She says she will work hard to bring back Michigan’s Democratic party and parties across the country. She talks about “inclusive” economics” and “inclusive” politics. That means, she says, supporting Obama and nominating   Supreme Court Justices. She says Justices need to expands voting rights, worker’s rights. She says “we have allowed our politics to be hijacked by extreme ideologues in state governments all over the country. ” Clinton says the stakes keep getting higher while the rhetoric on the other side keeps getting lower. She says “you really want to pull your hair out” (would be quite something if she actually tried to pull out her hair) when you see the   from Republicans. Clinton says we have to “make America whole” again and says “diversity is a strength and not a weakness. ” She says let’s try to find “a little more love and kindness in our hearts. ” 9:10: Clinton projected to Win Louisiana. 9:05: NBC Calls Nebraska for Sanders. 8:50: Cruz officially wins Maine.

He says Clinton voted for all the disastrous trade deals while he was on the picket lines opposing them. He also hits Clinton for her Iraq vote. And slams her for touting Kissinger’s praise of her. “Why one would look for approval from one of the worst, destructive Secretaries of States  …     I don’t understand.

Sanders wants to thank everyone in the audience “on behalf of the Walton family” and says it is time for the Walton family “to get off welfare” and pay their workers more. Now Sanders says the “corporate media” want to talk about everything except for criminal justice reform. 7:18: CNN CUTS SANDERS OFF RIGHT AFTER HE RIPS HILLARY FOR WALL STREET SPEECHES: Sanders rips Clinton for giving speeches behind closed door to Wall Street. He says “I kinda think if you are going to be paid $225, 000 for a speech,” it must be a brilliant speech you want to share with the American people. Must have been a “Shakespearean speech,” he says. Where was this Sanders earlier in the campaign? [Interestingly, CNN, the Clinton News Network, cuts Sanders off as he starts attacking Clinton.] 7:15: Sanders gets primetime coverage as he speaks in Michigan. He blast the Koch brothers and a “few other billionaires” for trying to buy this election. Sanders says when you have a family spending more money than   that is not democracy, it is “oligarchy” and “we are going to stop them. ” 7:01: Rubio underperformed in Kansas. Since it’s March Madness, Trump is like the college basketball team that doesn’t need to win its conference tournament to make the Big Dance. You get the sense that other candidates are like the teams that won’t get   bids if they don’t win their conference tournaments and every state going forward is a “ ” state for them.

He says he is the strongest conservative in the race. Cruz says Trump has the delegate lead but points out that he continues to rack up delegates as well. Cruz says he was second even in the places where Trump prevailed on Tuesday. He says what needs to happen is the field needs to narrow so Trump doesn’t have an advantage. Cruz says if you are not able to win states, there comes a point where candidates need to prayerfully reflect whether they have a path to win the nomination. Cruz says he is competing “vigorously” in Florida when asked if he will go for a “kill shot” (violent language!) against Rubio in Florida by a mainstream media reporter. 5:59: Cruz says he will unchain the free enterprise to grow the economy in order to defeat ISIS like Reagan disposed of the Soviet Union. “We will utterly destroy ISIS,” he says.

CNN cut away from it.  CNN and MSNBC live with Cruz Idaho speech.  Not Fox.  —   Chris Wilson (@WilsonWPA) March 5, 2016,  5:47: Cruz says the “scream” and “howl” you hear from Washington is utter terror at what “we the people are doing together. ” He says the last two weeks have been extraordinary. Cruz said there were 17 candidates in the race a year ago and now Republicans, libertarians and men and women who love freedom and the Constitution are standing as one behind his campaign. He says everyone understands the countries at risk and our Constitutional rights are under assault each and every day. He says voters know America has receded from the world and the world is a much dangerous place because of it. Cruz says he is here with a word of hope because people are “waking up” all  America. Cruz says “jobs, freedom, and security” will be the three top issues in the election. He wants to talk to single moms who have been working more hours because Obamacare has reduced their hours. He wants to talk to men and women with callouses on their hands who have seen their wages become stagnant while the cost of living has gone up.

He says if the establishment group, headed by Mitt Romney, starts to play games, they are sticking it to “you  …     the movement. ”  He blasts the GOP “eggheads” who “cannot even tie their shoes” for slamming Trump on trade. “It has to be smart trade. It has to be even trade,” he says. “We can’t lose $500 billion a year with China. ” Trump says Forbes is undervaluing his net worth because he is friends with Romney. 4:20: Trump says the country has been so great to him that he is running to pay the country back. “It’s payback time. ” Trump blasts the Republicans for asking him to sign a pledge to not run as a   candidate and then promptly discussing “clowns” they want to back for a   run if Trump wins the nomination to give the presidency to Clinton. 4:17: Trump asks Florida crowd to pledge to vote for him.

He blasts Romney who “choked” in the last election. He says he never thought Romney was smart.

He says we need “greatness” and not “mediocrity” and “phoniness. ” 3:37: Trump wonders what Rubio is doing with all of his free time and blasts him for not showing up for votes in the Senate. “That’s not the deal you made,” he says, adding that that’s not the type of person you want representing Florida. 3:33: Trump says the GOP’s enthusiasm this election cycle is not being talked about enough.

It’s very real.  —   Dr. Milton Wolf (@miltonwolfmd) March 5, 2016,  2:40: At Trump’s rally, Stephen Miller (former communications director for Jeff Sessions) Trump’s senior policy adviser, reminds the audience that Rubio swore to fight against amnesty while running against Charlie Crist. But when he got to Washington, Rubio, Miller says, met with the special interests and the “rich and powerful who don’t care about you” to become the biggest champion of amnesty in the U. S. Congress. He says “Marco Rubio lied to every person in the state of Florida. ” He asks voters to make Florida Rubio’s “Waterloo. ” He says Rubio “sold his soul” to the   class. Miller is a very effective surrogate for Trump. Why is this guy not on television more representing the Trump campaign?  Miller rips Rubio for repeatedly saying that Rubio tried to get the best bill that he could. He reminds the audience that Rubio’s bill issued work permits to 12 million illegal immigrants to take jobs from every American, would issue 33 million green cards to immigrants in ten years, and made it easier to import unlimited numbers of refugees from the Middle East with no additional screening. He says Rubio’s bill doubled the number of   foreign guest workers. He says Rubio met with La Raza, Chamber of Commerce, Barack Obama, but he did not meet with law enforcement (law enforcement officers said Rubio treated them like “absolute trash”) before he pushed for his bill that gave amnesty to illegal immigrant criminal rapists, etc. Miller says “Marco Rubio does not work for you. He only works for the special interests. ” He says Rubio is for unlimited Muslim immigration. 2:22: Wilkerson says Trump has two feet firmly planted in America while Rubio has one foot in America and the other where his backers need him to be. 2:20: At Trump’s rally Laura Wilkerson telling her story and slamming Rubio for supporting the Gang of Eight and never reaching out to victims of illegal immigrant crime.

Gives standard stump speech to huge applause. “Young Americans won’t have a chance if the conservative movement is hijacked by somebody who isn’t a conservative,” receives a standing ovation. CNN’s Dana Bash interviews Rubio  . The first few questions primarily and predictable center on Donald Trump and not Rubio’s Gang of 8 immigration betrayal. Why in the world would CPAC or Rubio agree to allow a CNN hack to depose our candidates? This is why we lose. Would Democrats allow Sean Hannity to depose one of their presidential candidates like this? Of note is the fact that while he referenced Trump in his speech, he never once mentioned Trump by name. Apparently, the ugly attacks Rubio launched against Trump either did not work or ran their course.   12:04  —   Sean Penn: GOP candidates make me miss George W.

While many people call the Donald a fraud, a   there are a lot of voters out there who think they have been conned election after election. They know what it is to be promised something and delivered nothing.   11:07  —   Latest poll out of Florida has Trump up only +5 over Rubio: 35%  —   30% A new poll by an   Trump group has found a narrowing Republican presidential race in Florida, suggesting the barrage of TV ads by the group and its allies might be taking effect. Trump leads Marco Rubio   percent ahead of the March 15 primary, according to the poll conducted for Our Principles PAC by The Tarrance Group, a Republican firm, and obtained by the Miami Herald. Ted Cruz drew 16 percent support, John Kasich 9 percent and Ben Carson 5 percent. (Carson formally dropped out Friday.) Six percent of respondents were undecided.   …     The new poll offered a glimmer of hope for Rubio in that he continues to have the most favorable rating among all the candidates. That gives him the most room to grow among undecided voters according to the poll, 24 percent of respondents are still picking a candidate. Sixteen percent are leaning toward one, and 57 percent have already decided. A big problem for Rubio, if this surge is real (as of now this poll is an outlier) is that more than a   votes were cast early while Trump was up 20 points. The story is a bit misleading. The poll was not done “by” an   it was done by a legit pollster on behalf of an   group.   11:05  —   How the GOP could stop Trump at the convention, Such a gambit would be chaotic and controversial, however. It would likely also face one large hurdle that needs to be removed before the voting starts. As things currently stand, only a candidate who has the backing of a majority of delegates from eight states can even make it onto the nominating ballot. The easiest way to acquire such backing is to win eight primaries. But at present, Ted Cruz is four states shy of that mark, Marco Rubio has won only one contest and no other candidate, barring Trump, has won anything.   10:54  —   Cruz: Brokered convention would lead to voter ‘revolt‘ Cruz is very smart to distance himself from those in the Republican Establishment looking to steal the nomination for Marco Rubio, someone rejected by 85% of GOP voters and who probably could win the presidency of his home state of Florida.   10:49  —   Trump accused of breaking Fox News’s debate rules. Being as that Fox News operates like an   super PAC, who can blame him? It is about winning, not playing by a game that is already rigged.   VIDEO:    Alex Marlow on  .

Rubio will hold an afternoon rally Saturday in Jacksonville with New Mexico GOP Gov. Susana Martinez, a nod to the importance of Hispanic voters beyond Rubio’s   base in South Florida. Later that evening, he’ll travel to Puerto Rico ahead of the territory’s primary on Sunday.

       "        <td>Wednesday,   Donald Trump addressed reporters at a press conference from Trump Tower in New York City.  Transcript as follows: SPICER: Morning. Thanks for being here (ph). (inaudible) days away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the United States. It’s an opportunity to be here today to allow the   to take your questions. After the   makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D. C. with the prestigious form of Morgan Lewis who will  —   who structured the agreements pursuant to the president’s business arrangements and she will give brief remarks. Before we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night. It’s frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a   blog that was openly hostile to the  ’s campaign to drop highly salacious and flat out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office. According to BuzzFeed’s own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report. The executive editor of the New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, “Totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet. ” SPICER: The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks. The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple. One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign. These three individuals Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, and Carter Page. Carter Page is an individual who the   does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign. Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time. We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague. In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague. A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at  —   at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game. One report now suggested apparently it’s another Michael Cohen. For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful. With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. (APPLAUSE) PENCE: We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I’m even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again. (APPLAUSE) Now, the  ’s leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive. But as the Chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring. To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet. Nineteen of the 21 Cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a  —   it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward. Perhaps that’s why there’s been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration. You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be. But with freedom comes responsibility. And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the   and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it. In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague. A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at  —   at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game.

(APPLAUSE) But today, we’ll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again. And we’ll hear from the   about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today. So, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the   of the United States of America, Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Thank you very much. It’s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a almost daily basis. I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it’s good to be with you. TRUMP: We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but I do have to say that  —   and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies? Who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that. A tremendous blot, because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released. But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years  —   a couple in particular  —   and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station. So, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room. I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that. But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional  —   so incredibly professional, that I’ve just gone up a notch as to what I think of you. OK? All right. We’ve had some great news over the last couple of weeks. I’ve been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country. A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies  —   big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest. You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they’re going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant. I appreciate that from Ford. I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler. I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be. I think a lot of people will be following. I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back. We’ve got to get our drug industry back. Our drug industry has been disastrous. They’re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don’t make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they’re getting away with murder. Pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there’s very little bidding on drugs. We’re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don’t bid properly and we’re going to start bidding and we’re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time. And we’re going to do that with a lot of other industries. I’m very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the   you’ve been reading about it. And it’s way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. I don’t like that. And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. I’ve really gotten to know them well. And we’re going to do some big things on the   program, and perhaps the   program. And we’re going to get those costs way down and we’re going to get the plane to be even better. And we’re going to have some competition and it’s going to be a beautiful thing. So, we’ve been very, very much involved, and other things. We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here. There are no  —   they’re going to do tremendous things  —   tremendous things in this country. And they’re very excited. And I will say, if the election didn’t turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here. They would not be in my office. They would not be in anybody else’s office. They’d be building and doing things in other countries. So, there’s a great spirit going on right now. A spirit that many people have told me they’ve never seen before, ever. We’re going to create jobs. I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that, I really  —   I’m going to work very hard on that. We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we’re going to do a real job. And I’m very proud of what we’ve done. And we haven’t even gotten there yet. I look very much forward to the inauguration. It’s going to be a beautiful event. We have great talent, tremendous talent. And we have the  —   all of the bands  —   or most of the bands are from the different  —   from the different segments of the military. And I’ve heard some of these bands over the years, they’re incredible. We’re going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special very beautiful. And I think we’re going to have massive crowds because we have a movement. TRUMP: It’s a movement like the world has never seen before. It’s a movement that a lot of people didn’t expect. And even the polls  —   although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn’t. And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour in. And we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they’re gonna have a lot of security. They’re going to have a lot of good news for their veterans. And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we’ll do a news release in a little while. Tell you about David, he’s fantastic  —   he’s fantastic. He will do a truly great job. One of the commitments I made is that we’re gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. Our veterans have been treated horribly. They’re waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor   form of cancer and they can’t see a doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they’re terminal. Not gonna happen, it’s not gonna happen. So, David is going to do a fantastic job. We’re going to be talking to a few people also to help David. And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have. And we’re gonna set up a  —   a group. These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. And they’re going to get together with their great doctors  —   Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved. Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. And we’re gonna straighten out the V. A. for our veterans. I’ve been promising that for a long time and it’s something I feel very, very strongly. So, you’ll get the information on David. And I think you’ll be very impressed with the job he does. We looked long and hard. We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good. But we had a lot of talent. And we think this election will be something that will, with time  —   with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good ’cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly. OK, questions? Yes, John (ph)? QUESTION: (Inaudible) so much. TRUMP: Thank you. QUESTION: Appreciate it. A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we’re looking for further clarification on. TRUMP: Sure. QUESTION: First of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the   summary of these unsubstantiated allegations? And secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC? And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States? TRUMP: OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified. So, I’m not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting. And  —   but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it’s a disgrace that information would be let out. I saw the information I read the information outside of that meeting. It’s all fake news. It’s phony stuff. It didn’t happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together  —   sick people  —   and they put that crap together. So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should have never been  —   number one, shouldn’t have even entered paper. But it should have never have been released. But I read what was released and I think it’s a disgrace. I think it’s an absolute disgrace. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I  —   I can say that you know when  —   when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn’t make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China. We had  —   we had much hacking going on. And one of the things we’re gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we’ve assembled. You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world  —   they were never in the same room together as a group. And we’re gonna put those minds together and we’re going to form a defense. TRUMP: And I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job. They could’ve had hacking defense, which we had. And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense. And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through. We have to do that for our country. It’s very important. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   …     just to the last part of that question (inaudible) how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President Putin? TRUMP: Well, you know, President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news. They said it totally never happened. Now, somebody would say, “Oh, of course he’s gonna say that. ” I respected the fact that he said that. And I  —   I’ll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would’ve released it they would’ve been glad to release it. I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would’ve released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her. I mean what he said about her was horrible. If somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would’ve fired him immediately or that person. Because what he said about her was horrible. But remember this: We talk about the hacking and hacking’s bad and it shouldn’t be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking. That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn’t report it? That’s a horrible thing. That’s a horrible thing. Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate  —   it would’ve been the biggest story in the history of stories. And they would’ve said immediately, “You have to get out of the race. ” Nobody even talked about it. It’s a very terrible thing. Yeah? QUESTION: Can I ask you a question, sir? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.  . On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election. Do you accept that part of the finding? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place? TRUMP: Well, if  —   if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky. I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed. If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That’s called an asset, not a liability. Now, I don’t know that I’m gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there’s a good chance I won’t. And if I don’t, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break. OK? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   …     President Obama  …     (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   …     make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St. Petersburg, you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable  …     (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agencies? TRUMP: Lemme just tell you what I do. When I leave our country, I’m a very   person, would you say? I am extremely careful. I’m surrounded by bodyguards. I’m surrounded by people. And I always tell them  —   anywhere, but I always tell them if I’m leaving this country, “Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you’re gonna probably have cameras. ” I’m not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category. And number one, “I hope you’re gonna be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can’t see them and you won’t know. You better be careful, or you’ll be watching yourself on nightly television. ” I tell this to people all the time. I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well  —   Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well. And I told many people, “Be careful, because you don’t wanna see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place. ” And again, not just Russia, all over. Does anyone really believe that story? I’m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me. (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   …     how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business. But first, I have to   on some of these Russian remarks. Based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it? TRUMP: So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. I have assets that are  —   and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt  —   I have very low debt. But I have no loans with Russia at all. And I thought that was important to put out. I certified that. So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don’t want to because I think that would be a conflict. So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals. Now, I have to say one other thing. Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai  —   a number of deals and I turned it down. I didn’t have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a   situation because I’m president, which is  —   I didn’t know about that until about three months ago, but it’s a nice thing to have. But I don’t want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don’t have, Vice President Pence also has it. I don’t think he’ll need it, I have a feeling he’s not going to need it. But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president. It was many, many years old, this is for presidents. Because they don’t want presidents getting  —   I understand they don’t want presidents getting tangled up in minutia they want a president to run the country. So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don’t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can’t do that in any other capacity. But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company  —   the country. I’d do a very good job, but I don’t want to do that. Now, all of these papers that you see here  —   yes, go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) do you believe the hacking was justified? And will you release your tax returns to prove what you’re saying about no deals in Russia? TRUMP: I’m not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they’re under audit. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   …     since the ’70’s has had a required audit from the IRS, the last place to release them, but as president sir  …     TRUMP: You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? They’re the only who ask. QUESTION: You don’t think the American public is concerned about it? TRUMP: No I don’t think so. I won, when I became president. No, I don’t think they care at all. I don’t think they care at all. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I think you care  —   I think you care. First of all, you learn very little to a tax return. What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers. And actually, people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize, my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought. We’re in many, many countries, and I’m very proud of it. And what I’m going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company. They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They’re not going to discuss it with me. Again, I don’t have to do this. They’re not going to discuss it with me. And with that, I’m going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she’s going to go  —   these papers are just some of the many documents that I’ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons. (CROSSTALK) DILLON: Good morning. It’s my honor and privilege to be here today at   Trump’s request. He’s asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he’s taking. As you know, the business empire built by   Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned.   Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people’s business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company. He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests. DILLON: As he said, he’s voluntarily taking this on. The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets. The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it’s simply inapplicable by its terms. And this is not just our interpretation. It’s Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president. Even so,   Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law. Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H. W. Bush’s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center. Mr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He’s here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization. I’m gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the   is taking. First,   Trump’s investments and business assets commonly known as the  —   as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th. Here is just some of the paperwork that’s taking care of those actions. Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by   Trump. Further, at the  ’s direction, the trust agreement provides  —   that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.   Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency.   Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities. Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D. C. Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools. The   has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics. Second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of   Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower,    all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust. Through instructions in the trust agreement,   trust  —     Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for   Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric. DILLON: The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump’s presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process. The   will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could  —   and I emphasize could  —   be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues. The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval. To further reinforce the wall that we are building between   Trump and the Trump Organization,   Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting. Another step that   Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency. He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to   Trump’s role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency. In sum, all of these actions  —   complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights  —   will sever   Trump’s presidency from the Trump Organization. Some have asked questions. Why not divest? Why not just sell everything? Form of blind trust. And I’d like to turn to addressing some of those questions now. Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization’s assets. If   Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency. Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the  . And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.   Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn’t even feasible. Some people have suggested that the   sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive   debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the   were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now. Some people have suggested that the Trump  —   that   Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a  . It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization. Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. President Trump can’t unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized. DILLON: Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. It creates a complete separation from   Trump  —   it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal. I’m going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That’s a word I think we’ve all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before. And we’re gonna describe some other actions that   Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. Emoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says “officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office. ” The   Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder. No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a    exchange not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument. But since   Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm’  transactions that the   has absolutely nothing to do with and isn’t even aware of. These people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It’s not an emolument. The Constitution does not require   Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires. So,   Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit. In sum, I and  ’s (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we’ve outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the   and his family. We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the  ’s desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure. The American people were well  —   well aware of   Trump’s business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.   Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK) DILLON: You’re welcome. My pleasure. Yes (ph). Don’t want to lose your note. Thank you. TRUMP: Thank you very much. Here you go, you (ph). DILLON: Thank you. QUESTION: Mr. Trump? Thank you. Mr. Trump, (inaudible) from America News. What is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest? And do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your  —   your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration  …     (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I  —   I really think that when you watch what’s going on with what’s happening in  —   I was just watching, as an example, Rex Tillerson. I think it’s brilliant what he’s doing and what he’s saying. I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general. And he was brilliant. And what people don’t know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama. And he was brilliant yesterday. So, I really think that they are  —   I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together. And we’ve been hearing that from so many people. People are so happy. You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it. When they needed something, he would be there. A friend of mine who’s very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm  —   big supporter  —   he said there’s nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson. And that’s what we want. That’s what I want to bring to government. I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we’re way behind. We don’t make good deals any more. I say it all the time in speeches. We don’t make good deals anymore we make bad deals. Our trade deals are a disaster. TRUMP: We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis  —   hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody. We don’t make good deals anymore. So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they’re smart. And that’s what I’d put, I’m very proud of the Cabinet, I think they’re doing very well. It’s very interesting how it’s going, but it’s  —   I think they’re doing very, very well. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   …     a quick   on  —   on Russia, sir. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.  . I wanted to ask a few questions on Obamacare? TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Can you be specific on what guidance you’re giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or  …     (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Finally, Obamacare, I thought it was never gonna be asked. QUESTION: ( ) though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare law? TRUMP: You’re gonna be very, very proud, as not only the media and reporters, you’re gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care. Obamacare is a complete and total disaster. They can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you. In some cases, they guide you incorrectly. In most cases, you realize what’s happened, it’s imploding as we sit. Some states have over a hundred percent increase and ’17 and I said this two years ago, ’17 is going to be the bad year. It’s going to be catastrophic. Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn’t be fair to the people. We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don’t wanna own it, we don’t wanna own it politically. They own it right now. So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in ’17 and believe me, we’d get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. We’re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary’s approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan. It’ll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour. So we’re gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we’re gonna get a health bill passed, we’re gonna get health care taken care of in this country. You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can’t even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high. Obamacare is the Democrats problem. We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them. We’re doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service. So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we’ll be filing a plan. And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times. And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare. We’re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   can we just ask you  —   sir, sir  …     QUESTION:   Trump  …     (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Mr. President  —   which one? TRUMP: I was going right here. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   Trump, Jon Steinberg (ph) from Cheddar. When you look at all the meetings that you’ve had with Carrier, SoftBank and Alibaba, do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce? And then my   question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts? TRUMP: Well, if I can save jobs, for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well, that’s only one company, like we did a good job with Carrier. And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs. And they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot. But those were  —   that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it’s always tough when they’re building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement. TRUMP: So I wanna thank United Technologies. But we’ve been meeting with a lot of companies. But what really is happening, is the word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason, it’s not going to happen that way anymore. You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you’re going to build that plant in Mexico and you’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you’re making, and you’re going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border  —   not a weak border like it is  —   we don’t even have a border. It’s an open sieve. But you’re going to sell through a very strong border  —   not going to happen. You’re going to pay a very large border tax. So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina. You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan. You can do anywhere  —   you’ve got a lot of states at play a lot of competition. So it’s not like, oh, gee, I’m taking the competition away. You’ve got a lot of places you can move. And I don’t care, as along as it’s within the United States, the borders of the United States. There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you’d have millions more workers right now in the United States that are  —   96 million really wanting a job and they can’t get. You know that story. The real number  —   that’s the real number. So, that’s the way it is. OK. Go ahead. QUESTION:   I have a question about the Supreme Court and border security. But I also wanted to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning. Are we living in Nazi Germany? What were you driving at there? Do you have a problem with the intelligence community? And on the Supreme Court, what’s your timeline? You said a while ago you were down to four. Have you conducted those interviews yet? What’s your timeline for nominating? And on the border fence, it now appears clear U. S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front. What is your plan to  …     TRUMP: That’s not clear at all. OK. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   …     to get Mexico to pay for it? TRUMP: I’ve got it. Do you have any more? (LAUGHTER) On the fence  —   it’s not a fence. It’s a wall. You just misreported it. We’re going to build a wall. I could wait about a     until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but I don’t want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin. I don’t feel like waiting a year or a    . We’re going to start building. Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it’s a tax or whether it’s a payment  —   probably less likely that it’s a payment. But it will happen. So, remember this, OK? I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. I would then say, who is going to pay for the wall? And people would all scream out  —   25, 000, 30, 000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had. You know that. You don’t like to report that, but that’s OK. OK, now he agrees. Finally, he agrees. But I say who is going to pay for the wall? And they will scream out, “Mexico. ” Now, reports went out last week  —   oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. What’s the difference? I want to get the wall started. I don’t want to wait a     until I make my deal with Mexico. And we probably will have a deal sooner than that. And by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice. I respect the government of Mexico. I respect the people of Mexico. I love the people of Mexico. I have many people from Mexico working for me. They’re phenomenal people. The government of Mexico is terrific. I don’t blame them for what’s happened. I don’t blame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. I don’t blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico. What I say is we shouldn’t have allowed that to happen. It’s not going to happen anymore. So, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed. OK? Supreme Court judge. So, as you know, I have a list of 20. I’ve gone through them. We’ve met with numerous candidates. They’re outstanding in every case. They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society. Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he’s a fantastic guy. TRUMP: So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople, we have a great group of people. I’ll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice Scalia. That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. So within about two weeks, probably the second week. I consider the first day because we’ll also be doing some  —   some pretty good signings and I think what we’ll do is we’ll wait until Monday. That will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we’re having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. So our first day  —   and you’ll all be invited to the signings, but we’ll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week. And you’re all invited. But on the Supreme Court, I’ll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it’s one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected. QUESTION: The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany, what were you driving at there? What are you trying to tell the American public? TRUMP: I think it was disgraceful  —   disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it’s a disgrace, and I say that  —   and I say that, and that’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. I think it’s a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public. As far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they’re going to suffer the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up  —   and by the way, we just found out I was coming down. Michael Cohen  —   I was being  —   Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer. He’s a good lawyer in my firm. It was just reported that it wasn’t this Michael Cohen they we’re talking about. So all night long it’s Michael Cohen. I said, “I want to see your passport. ” He brings his passport to my office. I say, hey, wait a minute. He didn’t leave the country. He wasn’t out of the country. They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen. It’s a disgrace what took place. It’s a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen. QUESTION: Since you’re attacking us, can you give us a question? Mr.    —   TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr.   since you are attacking our news organization  …     TRUMP: Not you. QUESTION: Can you give us a chance? TRUMP: Your organization is terrible. QUESTION: You are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir? Sir, can you  …     TRUMP: Quiet. QUESTION: Mr.   can you say  …     TRUMP: He’s asking a question, don’t be rude. Don’t be rude. QUESTION: Can you give us a question since you’re attacking us? Can you give us a question? TRUMP: Don’t be rude. No, I’m not going to give you a question. I’m not going to give you a question. QUESTION: Can you state  …     TRUMP: You are fake news. Go ahead. QUESTION: Sir, can you state categorically that nobody  —   no, Mr.   that’s not appropriate. TRUMP: Go ahead. (APPLAUSE) QUESTION: Do you think President Obama went too far with the sanctions he put on Russia after the hacking? TRUMP: I don’t think he went too far. No. QUESTION: Will you roll them back? What do you think of Lindsey Graham’s plan to send you a bill for  …     TRUMP: Plans to send me a bill for what? QUESTION: Tougher sanctions. TRUMP: I hadn’t heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that. Lindsey Graham. I’ve been competing with him for a long time. He is going to crack that one percent barrier one day. I didn’t realize Lindsey Graham still had it. That’s all right. I think Lindsey Graham is a nice guy. I’ve heard that he is a nice guy and I’ve been hearing it. Go ahead. Go ahead. You’ve been waiting. QUESTION: As far as we understand, the intelligence community  …     TRUMP: Stand up. QUESTION: From BBC news. Ian Pannell from BBC news. TRUMP: BBC news. That’s another beauty. QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you. As far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it. If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position  …     TRUMP: There’s nothing they could come back with. QUESTION: Can you  …     TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) published fake news and all the problems that we’ve seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here? TRUMP: Well, I don’t recommend reforms. I recommend people that are  —   that have some moral compass. You know, I’ve been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they’re talking about people that go and say all sorts of things. But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody. I could name them, but I won’t bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us. They’re very, very dishonest people, but I think it’s just something we’re going to have to live with. TRUMP: I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back. When it happens to somebody that doesn’t have this  —   doesn’t have that kind of a megaphone, they can’t speak back. It’s a very sad thing. I’ve seen people destroyed. I’ve seen people absolutely destroyed. And I think it’s very unfair. So, all I can ask for is honest reporters. Yes? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the U. S. intelligence community. And be very clear about what you’re saying. Do you trust your U. S. intelligence officials? And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you’re actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community? TRUMP: Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important. We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo and others, you know the Senator Dan Coats. We’re going to be putting in some outstanding people. Within 90 days, they’re going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking. I want them to cover this situation. I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly  —   because we’re hacked by everybody  —   you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it’s number 17, in terms of protection. If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries  —   they put this in the category of an industry  —   the United States is last in terms of protecting, let’s say, hacking defense. Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee. That’s why we weren’t hacked. By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren’t able to hack. And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense. The Democratic National Committee didn’t do that. Maybe that’s why the country runs so badly that way. But I will tell you  —   wait  —   wait  —   wait, let me finish. Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena  —   fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody. That includes Russia and China and everybody  —   everybody. OK. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead  —   go ahead. QUESTION: Mr.   you said, just now, that you believe Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and Jon Podesta’s   et cetera. TRUMP: All right, but you know what, it could have been others also. QUESTION: But why did you spend weeks undermining U. S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement? TRUMP: Well, I think it’s pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. I think it’s pretty sad. First of all, it’s illegal. You know, these are  —   these are classified and certified meetings and reports. I’ll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody’s leaking it out. So, there’s  —   maybe it’s my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it’s them. And what I did is I said I won’t tell anybody. I’m going to have a meeting and I won’t tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence. And what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn’t know  —   I didn’t tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting. So, I don’t want that  —   I don’t want that. It’s very unfair to the country. It’s very unfair to our country what’s happened. That report should have never  —   first of all, it shouldn’t have been printed because it’s not worth the paper it’s written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that. I thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.   can you stand here today, once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign. And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now? TRUMP: He shouldn’t be doing it. He won’t be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I’m leading than when other people have led it. You will see that. Russia will respect our country more. He shouldn’t have done it. I don’t believe that he will be doing it more now. We have to work something out, but it’s not just Russia. Take a look at what’s happened. You don’t report it the same way 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that’s because we have no defense. That’s because we’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing. Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I’m leading it and I believe and I hope  —   maybe it won’t happen, it’s possible. But I won’t be giving (ph) a little reset button like Hillary. Here, press this piece of plastic. A guy looked at her like what is she doing? There’s no reset button. We’re either going to get along or we’re not. I hope we get along, but if we don’t, that’s possible too. But Russia and other countries  —   and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total. Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations. I want to thank everybody. So this is all  —   just so you understand, these papers  —   because I’m not sure that was explained properly. But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I’ll come back and say, oh, you did a good job. Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I’ll say, “You’re fired. ”   everybody.  . Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo</td>\n",

       "        <td>President Trump on Thursday announced his new nominee for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, during a news conference at the White House. Following is a transcript of that event, as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live analysis. TRUMP: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He’s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed did very, very well. And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he’s going to be  —   I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of labor. And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the   or as they say, “never Trump. ” And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support. And it’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time. It’s very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that. I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions. And I had this time. We’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we’ve done some really good work. We’re very proud of that. And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we’ll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That’s always a possibility. I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done. A new Rasmussen poll, in fact  —   because the people get it  —   much of the media doesn’t get it. They actually get it, but they don’t write it. Let’s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is  —   to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, “Oh, that’s good. ” Now it means, “That’s good for jobs. ” Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league  —   Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I’m making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit  —   a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not, and that’s OK, too. TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D. C. along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking  —   and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure we’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort  —   not all the time  —   and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say  —   they’re honest and fantastic. But much of it is not a  —   the distortion  —   and we’ll talk about it, you’ll be able to ask me questions about it. But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country you see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea  —   we’ll take care of it folks we’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess. Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you’ve covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He’s over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it’s in large sections of the world. They’ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer  —   another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism, and we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now, it’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I’ve ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I’ve had great from Congress, generally. We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my  —   I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it’s depleted  —   it won’t be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I’m standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders. Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222, 230’s impossible. 270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before so that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media’s trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason. And  —   but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida five o’clock on Saturday and I heard  —   just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T. V. open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved. And they’re outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who’s there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague  —   highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We’re waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about and we can’t let that happen. So, if the Democrats who have  —   all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. I’ll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks  —   in the weeks coming. We’ve withdrawn from the   disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We’re going to make trade deals but we’re going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We’re going to have one on one deals. We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it’s many, many years. And then at the end of the process  —   they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me but it’s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it’s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries. We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. We’ve issued a   new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody’s ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say “let me see your regulations” and they’re fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental  —   all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing. We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation  —   take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer. We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general  —   now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke. We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is  —   that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further. We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that. TRUMP: And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D. C. I’ve started by imposing a   lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is’s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing. So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It’s already happening. But big league. I’ve also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson. He’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do. Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2, 000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here. General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here. Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10, 000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10, 000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we’re naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades  —   decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen. And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he’ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the   way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p. m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions. Mara (ph) Mara (ph) go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong  —   what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem. And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this  —   that they know nothing about it they weren’t in Russia they never made a phone call to Russia they never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal  —   I think it’s very important  —   the illegal, giving out classified information. It was  —   and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much. I’ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that’s  —   I spoke to the president of Mexico I had a good call. All of a sudden, it’s out there for the world to see. It’s supposed to be secret. It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I’m saying  —   the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed. Yes, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, “I don’t think he did anything wrong if anything, he did something right. ” He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, “Huh, that’s fine. ” That’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to  —   he didn’t just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were    countries. He’s doing the job. You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision. But he didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me. Yes? QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long   story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was  —   it’s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren’t even a part, really  —   I mean, they were such a minor part. They  —   I hadn’t spoken to them. I think the one person  —   I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very   member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That’s what he does. I mean, people know that. That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s  —   by the way, who’s by the way a respected man. He’s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody  —   people knew that. Everybody knew that. So, these people  —   and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories. TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that’s the extent. Russia is fake news. Russia  —   this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there, because we have our new people going in place, right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo has  —   has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in. And just while you’re at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time’s story, yesterday. And it talked about  —   these are (ph) front page. So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true. So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page? That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that. And it was totally  —   they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things. OK, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph) or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 ( ). (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Obama ( ) 426 on ( ). So why should Americans. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: . ..I’m skipping that information, I don’t know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin. QUESTION: ( ) why should Americans trust you ( ) the information ( )? TRUMP: Well, I don’t know, I was given that information. I was given  —   I actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that’s. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes? QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did  —   whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What —   what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks. TRUMP: We are. QUESTION: Can we ask what you’re going to do and also, we’ve heard about a  —   a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that? TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they’re in position so I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he’s offered his services and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of. But I don’t think we’re need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own. As far as the general’s concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong, you know, really didn’t think. It was really, what happened after that but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said “well I don’t see”  —   to me, he was doing the job. The information was provided by  —   who I don’t know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said “doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there. ” But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as  —   as far as the actual making the call, fact I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So  —   and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man. QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks  —   on the leaks, sir. .. TRUMP: . ..Go ahead. Finish off then I’ll get you. QUESTION: I’m sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You’ve said twice today. .. TRUMP: . ..Yes, we’re looking at them very  —   very, very serious. I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we’re  —   I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They’re put out by people either in agencies  —   I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act. You know what I say, when I  —   when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment  —   when I was called out on Mexico, I was  —   honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said “you know, it doesn’t make sense. That won’t happen” but that wasn’t that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who’s a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said “that’s terrible that it was leaked” but it wasn’t that important. But then I said to myself “what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?” What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very  —   you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don’t want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test. So I’m dealing with Mexico, I’m dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the “Washington Post” and gets put into the “New York Times” and I’m saying “what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East? What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty. QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks? TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do  —   and I hope we can correct it. Because there’s nobody I have more respect for  —   well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters. It’s very important to me and especially in this position. It’s very important. I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true and, you know, over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m OK with that. But I’m not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don’t watch it any more because it’s very good  —   he’s saying no. It’s OK, Jim (ph). It’s OK, Jim (ph) you’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one so don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be  —   I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now but I think that actually  —   I think that’d actually be better. People  —   I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know, Peter (ph) is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower  —   I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I’d appreciate it  —   again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. TRUMP: I think we’re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I’m looking, some of them had them approved immediately. I’m going forever and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for. And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they’d be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody’s good. And sometimes  —   I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that’s OK. That’s fine. But I think it would  —   I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information. They’re giving stuff  —   what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates. Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine  —   seriously  —   can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric  —   you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We’ll do you next Jim, I do you next( ph). QUESTION: ( ) clarify  —   TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador  —   TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION:  —   prior to your  —   TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION:  —   inauguration. TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION: And then fired him  —   TRUMP: Excuse me. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it. I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. And it came out that way  —   and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I’ve watched many other people say that. No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it. OK? Jim? QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don’t hate you. I don’t hate you. TRUMP: OK. QUESTION: So, pass that along  —   TRUMP: Ask  —   ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. OK? QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir  —   TRUMP: Well, that’s  —   well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting. QUESTION: It’s pretty good right now, actually. TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John. QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time  —   TRUMP: I was OK with it. QUESTION:  —   you said  —   you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30, 000  . I’m wondering, sir, if you  —   TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that. QUESTION: Then( ph) your( ph) numbers( ph) were off too. TRUMP: No  —   no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that. QUESTION: If  —   if I may ask you, sir, it  —   it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during( ph) the campaign  —   TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready? QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that  —   TRUMP: No  —   no, but let me do one at a time. QUESTION: If I may as a follow up? TRUMP: Do you mind? QUESTION: Yes, sir. TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you’re talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn’t classified information. But in one case, you’re talking about classified  —   regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong  —   at my suggestion  —   and I give Reince great credit for this  —   at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I don’t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so  —   they were  —   when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn’t even in the papers. Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she  —   and she should have reported herself. Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, “I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job. ” QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don’t understand. It seems that there’s a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake? TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: You know what it is? Here’s the thing. The public isn’t  —   you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved. I’m involved. I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life. But I’m involved. So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not. I just see many, many untruthful things. And I’ll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word “tone. ” The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such  —   I do get good ratings, you have to admit that  —   the tone is such hatred. I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox  Friends in the morning, they’re very honorable people. They’re very  —   not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That’s all I can say. It’s the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look  —   the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes  —   sometimes somebody gets. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive  . The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive  . And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth the hatred coming from other people on your network. Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I’m amazed by it. And I just think you’d be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know. I  —   I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s  —   it’s brutal. Now, they’ll take this news conference  —   I’m actually having a very good time, OK? But they’ll take this news conference  —   don’t forget, that’s the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, that’s how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people. That’s for sure. But I’m having a good time. Tomorrow, they will say, “Donald Trump rants and raves at the press. ” I’m not ranting and raving. I’m just telling you. You know, you’re dishonest people. But  —   but I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it. But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, “Donald Trump rants and raves. ” I’m not ranting and raving. Go ahead. QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup. .. TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have  —   let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down. We’ll. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir. .. TRUMP: I’m changing it from fake news, though. QUESTION: Doesn’t that under. .. TRUMP: Very fake news. QUESTION: . .. I know, but aren’t you. .. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news. TRUMP: And you’re not related to our new. .. QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say. TRUMP: I looked  —   you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta. QUESTION: I’m sure you checked that out, sir. TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it  —   I said  —   they said, “No, sir. ” I said, “Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree. ” QUESTION: But aren’t you  —   aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don’t like “fake news”? Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like. TRUMP: I do that. QUESTION: When you call it “fake news,” you’re undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important. TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here’s the thing. OK. I understand what you’re  —   and you’re right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I’ll say, “Wow, that’s going to be a great story. ” And I’ll get killed. I know what’s good and bad. I’d be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what’s good. I know what’s bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive  —   sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make OK. They’ll even make it negative. So I understand it. So, because I’m there. I know what was said. I know who’s saying it. I’m there. So it’s very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press  —   the public doesn’t believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go  —   as an example, you’re CNN, I mean it’s story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running  —   this is a   machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph). You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I’m saying “here’s my chief of staff,” a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right? We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some  —   all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job. And I said to myself, you know  —   and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said “you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. ” I mean, they’re fake. They’re not true. And isn’t that a shame because he’d rather be working on healthcare, he’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph). I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there’s a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know  —   you know, whatever reason. But  —   and I understand that. But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair and that’s why the public sees it. They see it. They see it’s not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news? And second. .. TRUMP: . ..I think they don’t believe it. I don’t think the public  —   that’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don’t think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that’s a ruse. That’s a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now tomorrow, you’ll say “Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible. ” It’s not terrible. It’s good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn’t do anything for Russia. I’ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton  —   that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who’s going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said “I know politically it’s probably not good for me. ” The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles off shore right out of the water. Everyone in this country’s going to say “oh, it’s so great. ” That’s not great. That’s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you’ve had a lot of presidents that haven’t taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can  —   now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But  —   but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said “you know. ” He’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying “you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It’s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story. ” OK? And that’s a shame because if we could get along with Russia  —   and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing. QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)? QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you. .. TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We’re doing Obamacare. We’re in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It’s not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner. So we’ll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March,   March. And after that, we’re going to come up, and we’re doing very well on tax reform. Yes? QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States. TRUMP: OK. QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel  —   the spy vessel off the coast of the United States. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries and a Russian plane buzzed a U. S. destroyer. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign . .. TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, “Hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States there’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us. ” Because the  —   you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, “Oh, isn’t that wonderful. ” But I know you well enough. Then you would say, “Oh, he was too tough he shouldn’t have done that. ” Look, all of the. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a reset. It failed. They all tried. But I’m different than those people. Go ahead. QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal? TRUMP: I have. I have. And I’m so beautifully represented. I’m so honored that the Senate approved him. He’s going to be fantastic. Yes, I think that I’ve already. .. QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir? TRUMP: No, I don’t think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal. Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal. I don’t know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough  —   the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world. If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along  —   and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There’s no upside. We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. QUESTION: So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are. .. TRUMP: Who did I say is not good? QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they’re not good. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, it’s not good, but they happened. QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine. .. TRUMP: They all happened recently. No. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. this country’s ability to work with Russia? TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they’re doing because they’re doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK? But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia. QUESTION: Can we. .. TRUMP: I gave  —   you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing. QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations? TRUMP: I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don’t talk about military response. I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months. “We are going to attack Mosul in four months. ” Then three months later, “We are going to attack Mosul in one month. ” “Next week, we are going to attack Mosul. ” In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things, you’re going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that. So I don’t have to tell you. I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do. ” I don’t have to do that. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn’t know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I’m not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything, but I’m not going to tell you. OK. QUESTION: Could I just ask you  —   thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble. .. TRUMP: Where are you from? QUESTION: BBC. TRUMP: Here’s another beauty. QUESTION: That’s a good line. Impartial, free and fair. TRUMP: Yeah. Sure. QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: Just like CNN right? QUESTION: On the travel ban  —   we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government. .. TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government. .. QUESTION: Were there any mistakes. .. TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that’s been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it’s 80 percent of the time, a lot. We had a bad decision. We’re going to keep going with that decision. We’re going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision. That’s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect. Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a   period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones. You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that’s like you. You have some bad people out there. Kelly said you can’t do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don’t have time to come in. Now nobody ever reports that. But that’s why we did it quickly. Now, if I would’ve done it a month, everything would’ve been perfect. The problem is we would’ve wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would’ve come into our country. Now in the meantime, we’re vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed. QUESTION: Just a brief  . But if it’s so urgent, why not introduce. .. TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election? TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that’s one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been. QUESTION: During the election? TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody. .. QUESTION: So you’re not aware of any contact during the course.. TRUMP: Look, look, look. .. QUESTION: . .. of the election? TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question? QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse. I know you have to get up and ask a question. It’s so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn’t. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does. Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that  —   whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that. QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election? TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he  —   now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time. QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks? QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five? QUESTION: Mr. President, on national. .. TRUMP: Wait. Let’s see. Who’s  —   I want to find a friendly reporter. QUESTION: Mr. ... TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. QUESTION: ( ). .. TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven’t seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the  —   anyone on your staff of being ( ). Because ( ). However, what we’ve already heard about and what we ( ) is ( ) so you’re general forecast (ph) like 48 ( ). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the ( ). .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:. ..he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it’s not, its not, not  —   not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question. So here’s the story, folks. Number one, I am the least   Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican  —   quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about  —   he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it. So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you, I’m Lisa (ph) from the. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines? TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific. .. TRUMP: It’s a very fair question. QUESTION: . ..countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration. TRUMP: Right. QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it? TRUMP: We’re gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids. In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way  —   it’s a very  —   it’s a very, very tough subject. We’re gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is  —   is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that. But the DACA situation is a very, very  —   it’s a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough. I’m not talking about new laws, I’m talking the existing law, is very rough, it’s very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision. But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we’re tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK? QUESTION: Mr. President. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..reopening of the White House Visitors Office? TRUMP: Yes. QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what’s first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean. .. TRUMP: Now, that’s what I call a nice question. That is very  —   who are you with? QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Good, I’m gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania’s terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania’s gonna be outstanding, that’s right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House. She, like others that she’s working with, feel very, very strongly about women’s issue, women’s difficulties. Very, very strongly, she’s a very, very strong advocate. I think she’s a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens, because she gets  —   she gets so unfairly  —   Melania, the things they say. I’ve known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find. And the things they say  —   I’ve known her for a long time  —   the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies. I’ll just tell you this. I think she’s going to be a fantastic first lady. She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they’re not doing this for money. They’re not doing this for pay, they’re doing this because they feel it both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school  —   because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left  —   she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that’s a very nice question. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that’s OK. QUESTION: It doesn’t( ph) have( ph) to be a bad question. TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead. QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you’re  —   TRUMP: Fix the inner cities. QUESTION:  —   president. Fixing the inner cities. TRUMP: Yep. QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that’s coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn’t bad, was it? TRUMP: That was very professional and very good. QUESTION: I’m very professional. TRUMP: We’ll be announcing the order in a little while and I’d rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible  —   you know, it takes a long time. It’s taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we’re going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we’re going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places and it’s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people  —   and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it  —   in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They’re living in hell. We can’t let that happen. So, we’re going to be very, very strong. That’s a great question and  —   and it’s a  —   it’s a very difficult situation because it’s been many, many years. It’s been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all  —   and safe. There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK? QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going  —   are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your  —   your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as  —   TRUMP: Am I going to include who? QUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional  —   TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION:  —   Hispanic Caucus  —   TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION: No  —   no  —   no. I’m not  —   TRUMP: Are they friends of yours? QUESTION: I’m just a reporter. TRUMP: Well, then( ph) set up the meeting. QUESTION: I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now. TRUMP: Let’s go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it’s great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it’s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically. I can’t have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy. QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well. TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can’t make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told  —   he was probably told “don’t meet with Trump. It’s bad politics. ” And that’s part of the problem in this country. OK, one more. QUESTION: (inaudible) TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can’t handle. This room can’t handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two. QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible) some of it by supporters in your name. What do you. .. TRUMP: . ..And some of it  —   can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side and you think it’s like playing it straight? No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won’t be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead. QUESTION: You’re the president now. What are you going to do about it? TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that? QUESTION: What are you going to do about  —   what are you going to do about (inaudible). TRUMP: Oh, I’m working on it. I’m working on it very  —   no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided  —   I didn’t come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here. We’re going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that’s part of it. But we’re going to work on education, we’re going to work on  —   you know, we’re going to stop  —   we’re going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we’re going to try and stop crime. We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime. But it’s very important to me  —   but this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try  —   I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much. It’s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks. END</td>\n",

       "        <td>On Monday, Jan. 9, less than two weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, hosted a dinner at his office in the Capitol with members of Trump’s inner circle. The guests included the  ’s chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon his    and family consigliere, Jared Kushner his chief of staff, Reince Priebus his economic adviser, Gary Cohn his nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin his incoming deputy chief of staff, Rick Dearborn and his   director, Marc Short. The ostensible purpose of the dinner was to discuss the details of Trump’s legislative agenda  —   in particular, the prospects for a sweeping   measure that Republicans, and especially Ryan, have been coveting for the past decade. It was hoped that the dinner could also establish some sort of common ground between Ryan and Bannon, the two figures who would arguably wield the greatest influence over how Trump’s campaign promises became law  —   or didn’t. Ryan was a fixture among establishment Republicans even before joining Mitt Romney’s presidential ticket in 2012, his previous labors on the House Budget Committee cementing his reputation as the    wizard of fiscal conservatism. Bannon, by contrast, was a renegade autodidact who read Plato and had seemingly materialized from nowhere to become the intellectual architect of Trump’s campaign and, later, administration. Up to this point, Ryan had epitomized to Bannon everything that was wrong with the Republican Party. Discussing the two parties’ shortcomings, Bannon later told me, “What’s that Dostoyevsky line: Happy families are all the same, but unhappy families are unhappy in their own unique ways?” (He meant Tolstoy.) “I think the Democrats are fundamentally afflicted with the inability to discuss and have an adult conversation about economics and jobs, because they’re too consumed by identity politics. And then the Republicans, it’s all this theoretical Cato Institute, Austrian economics, limited government  —   which just doesn’t have any depth to it. They’re not living in the real world. ” Breitbart News, the   media outlet Bannon ran before becoming the chief executive of the Trump campaign in August, had described Ryan, referring to his position on immigration, as “arguably the most   G. O. P. lawmaker in Congress”  —   an apostasy of nearly impeachable proportions from Bannon’s perspective. Worst of all, Ryan all but abandoned Trump during the 2016 campaign. After the leak in October of the damaging “Access Hollywood” tape, Ryan told fellow Republican House members on a conference call, “I am not going to defend Donald Trump  —   not now, not in the future. ” A Republican lawmaker on the call told Trump what Ryan had said, yet another reason for Bannon to regard himself as Ryan’s worst enemy. But as the dinner progressed, it became clear that Bannon and Ryan actually had some ideas in common. Over memorably bad chicken Parmesan, Ryan described his vision for a “  tax,” which would levy taxes on imports while offering exemptions for exports. His tax package would include “immediate expensing,” he explained, in which capital expenditures would be written off against profits in the first year rather than over time. It also would abolish the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. These were ideas Ryan had been pushing since 2008. Now they had Bannon’s attention. Taken together with a drastic reduction in corporate taxes, Bannon believed, Ryan’s scheme would spur a renaissance of a   export economy, producing   labor in keeping with Trump’s populism. “I would actually say,” Bannon remembers observing admiringly, “that this tax reform comes as close to a first step of economic nationalism as there is. ” “I would call it ‘responsible nationalism,’’u2009” Ryan said, according to Bannon. Bannon laughed. “You’re going to have a lot of folks in the Senate say this is breathtakingly radical. ” He meant it as a compliment. To Bannon, the entire world order  —   from the two political parties to the Wall Street reliance on leveraging to multiculturalism  —   was undergoing an extraordinary realignment, one made manifest in the 2016 election. According to Bannon’s vision, economic nationalism would reorient priorities to the working class’s benefit. Trade deals, jobs programs, tax incentives, immigration restrictions, environmental deregulation and even foreign policy would ultimately serve to restore the primacy of those Trump called “the forgotten Americans. ” In March, when I spoke to Trump by phone, I asked him what the term “economic nationalism” meant to him. Compared with Bannon’s revolutionary fervor, his reply was surprisingly cautious. “Well, ‘nationalism’  —   I define it as people who love the country and want it to do good,” he said. “I don’t see ‘nationalism’ as a bad word. I see it as a very positive word. It doesn’t mean we won’t trade with other countries. ” Trump’s tone was genial but also a touch defensive. His postelection honeymoon had been short, if it existed at all. There were the administrative intrigues and   Twitter drama, along with the questions about his campaign’s contacts with Russia, which had already forced the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Still, Trump’s legislative liaisons and their counterparts on Capitol Hill were doggedly negotiating a rollout of the Trump Era, one that would fulfill his most significant campaign promises  —   those that could not be done with just a stroke of Trump’s own pen but required acts of Congress. First, Obamacare would be repealed and replaced. Next, an austere budget would be passed, with emergency funds allotted for the construction of a wall along the Southern border. Then would come a   plan, presumably of the type Ryan and Bannon discussed. And finally, a bipartisan coalition would deliver a   infrastructure plan to Trump’s desk. If all this came to pass by the end of 2017, it would lend some credence to Trump’s pledge that this would be “the busiest Congress we’ve had in decades. ” But by March, this timetable was looking like a formidable “if. ” Trump himself seemed prone to distraction as he spoke to me from the Oval Office. Though I was asking about his policy aims, his musings swerved off to other vexations. More than once he denounced as “fake news” reports about his administration’s supposed disharmony. He brought up his speech before the joint session of Congress in February, “which I hope you liked, but I certainly have gotten great reviews  —   even the people who hate me gave me the highest review. ” During the call, I could hear Priebus nearby, occasionally murmuring encouragement. Trump sounded more clipped and less jaunty on the call than he did during the discursive chats I had with him last year on the campaign trail. The business of governing had little to do with any trade he had previously practiced. In Congress, he was grappling with an arcane and famously inefficient ecosystem over which he had little if any control  —   and people he incessantly derided on the campaign trail as being “all talk and no action. ” I asked him if he still felt that way. “It’s like any other industry,” he replied, somewhat morosely. “I’ve met some great politicians and some, to be honest, who aren’t so hot. ” Trump wanted to make sure that he was given adequate credit for his achievements, even in his administration’s infancy. “We’ve only been here for a tiny speck of time,” he said, “and what I’ve done with regulations, moving jobs back into the country, what I’ve done with airplane pricing and buying is amazing. We’ve done a lot. I think we’ve done more than anybody for this short period of time. ” Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson would take exception to this claim. And Trump’s significant actions to date have consisted entirely of executive orders. What he has not yet demonstrated is his ability to actually shepherd a bill into law. The only major legislation that congressional committees have even seen thus far is a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, which met with a stunning rebuke from Trump’s own party, forcing Ryan to withdraw the measure on the afternoon of March 24. At this stage of his presidency, Barack Obama had already signed into law his $787 billion   package and had moved on to holding White House meetings on health care. It’s conceivable that Trump could hit Day 100 with only minor symbolic legislative achievements to his name. For him to avoid this ignominy, the 45th president will have to develop a rapport with Washington’s 535 federal deal makers, including the ones who “aren’t so hot. ” Whether Trump’s agenda succeeds will also depend in no small measure on the ability of Bannon to expand his game beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. At 63, and with a fortune reported to be in the tens of millions of dollars  —   partly through his investment in the company that owns the syndication rights to “Seinfeld”  —   Bannon is regarded by Trump as a peer in the way that, say, the    lifelong politico Priebus is not. He is also approvingly seen as a fellow workaholic by the president (whose only known hobbies are golf and   CNN). And he is a deft operator who has learned from the successes and failures of other Trump advisers. He has carefully not claimed credit that the president would wish for himself and avoids giving expansive interviews on his own controversial views that might detract from his boss’s celebrity. Like the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Bannon understands that power in Trump World derives mainly from close and sustained physical proximity to the boss. Unlike Lewandowski, Bannon immediately grasped the importance of maintaining close relations with Jared Kushner, who factored heavily in Lewandowski’s dismissal from the Trump campaign last summer. But like Kushner, Bannon has never worked in government or at a   institute and has no meaningful experience when it comes to getting legislation passed. On the Hill, he has a few random associations  —   Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative John Culberson of Texas among them. Otherwise, he remains a looming but indistinct presence to the lawmakers who will be needed to pass most of Trump’s agenda. Bannon’s interest in this agenda predated his association with Trump. One evening in January 2013, two guests showed up for dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that Bannon liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. One was the man Bannon would later describe to me as his “mentor”: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. The other was Sessions’s top aide and protégé, a jittery    named Stephen Miller. Two months earlier, Obama decisively defeated Mitt Romney in the presidential election, prompting Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to commission an analysis of the state of the party and its future, known colloquially in Washington as the “autopsy,” which would be delivered that spring. The only certainty was that the report would urge Republicans to court the growing Latino electorate  —   which had voted for Obama by a   margin that November  —   by championing comprehensive immigration reform. The three men at the dinner table that night were among the few Republicans in town who thoroughly rejected that conclusion. Bannon wanted to talk to Sessions and Miller about a different report: an article written by Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst for the website RealClearPolitics, titled “The Case of the Missing White Voters. ” Trende observed that Obama’s victory was less a function of increased minority turnout than of the fact that 6. 6 million white voters who participated in the 2008 election stayed home in 2012. The reason for this drop, Trende argued, was that white   voters who did not approve of Obama but were alienated by Romney’s perceived elitism had not voted. These votes were gettable, Bannon believed. As he would later tell me: “The working class, and in particular the lower middle class, understands something that’s so obvious  —   which is that they’ve basically underwritten the rise of China. Their jobs, their raises, their retirement accounts have all fueled the private equity and venture capital that built China. Because China’s really built on investments and exports, right? People are smart enough to know that they’re getting played by both political parties. The two may be different on social issues, but when it comes to fundamental economics, they’re both the same. That’s why the American working class is interested in trade. It’s linked to their lives. ” Sessions shared Bannon’s belief that the Republican Party needed to emphasize immigration reduction, border security and the preservation of   jobs through trade policy rather than courting Latino voters with a bill he regarded as “amnesty. ” As Sessions would write in a memorandum to his Republican colleagues six months later, “This humble and honest populism  —   in contrast to the administration’s cheap demagoguery  —   would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party. ” At some point during the   dinner, Bannon recalls blurting out to Sessions, “We have to run you for president. ” Just two years earlier, in 2011, he made a similar pitch to Sarah Palin, after completing a documentary about her called “The Undefeated. ” Palin demurred. She was enjoying her life of celebrity and wealth, she had done little to immerse herself in policy minutiae and she was no doubt unsettled by Bannon’s warning that she stood little chance of defeating Obama. Now he delivered a similar message to Sessions. “Look, you’re not going to win,” he recalls saying. “But you can get the Republican nomination. And once you control the apparatus, you can make fundamental changes. Trade is No. 100 on the party’s list. You can make it No. 1. Immigration is No. 10. We can make it No. 2. ” Acknowledging that the drawling Alabama senator lacked Palin’s charisma, Bannon said, “You’ll be the  . ” But Sessions told Bannon he did not see himself running for president. “It was pretty obvious by the end of the night,” Bannon recalled, “that another candidate would have to do it. ” Two months later, on March 15, 2013, Bannon happened to be attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when Trump took the stage. Trump had been a marginal figure at most in politics up to that point, entertaining a Reform Party run in the 2000 election  —   when he speculated that he would probably take more votes from the Democratic candidate than the Republican one  —   and leading a conspiratorial crusade in 2011 to force Obama to release his birth certificate. The possibility that he might be a suitable host body for Bannon’s worldview had not occurred to Bannon before Trump spoke. But Trump’s grousing references to China’s economic superiority, to 11 million “illegals” and to the erosion of America’s manufacturing sector were right out of Bannon’s playbook. From his desk in the Russell Senate Office Building, Stephen Miller, too, watched Trump’s speech. By 2014, Miller was sending emails to friends expressing the hope that Trump would run for president. By the time Trump announced his candidacy, in June 2015, Sessions was officially uncommitted but privately of the view that Trump was best suited to tap into the movement that he, Miller and Bannon discussed over dinner more than two years earlier. Bannon’s early support for Trump was manifest in Breitbart’s breathless coverage of his candidacy. In an email he sent on Aug. 30, 2015, to his former filmmaking partner Julia Jones, Bannon explained that while Republican candidates like Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina were “all great,” Trump represented a superior choice, because he “is a nationalist who embraces Senator Sessions’s plan” on immigration. Still, recalls Sam Nunberg, Trump’s first campaign strategist, “Steve kept all of his cards. ” He added: “He was respectful to some of the other ones who were running, like Walker and Cruz and Carson. He didn’t want to be seen as  . ” When Trump publicly disparaged John McCain’s   credentials, Bannon  —   himself a Navy veteran  —   called Nunberg and demanded that Trump issue an apology. (Trump did not.) Bannon was well positioned as a supportive but not sycophantic observer by Aug. 13, 2016, when the Trump donor Rebekah Mercer read with alarm a New York Times account of the Trump campaign’s inability to handle its mercurial candidate. At Mercer’s behest, Bannon (whose website Mercer’s family helped underwrite) and Kellyanne Conway (who at that point was receiving money from both a Mercer family political action committee and the Trump campaign) flew out that day to East Hampton, N. Y. where Trump was attending a dinner   at the home of the New York Jets’ owner, Woody Johnson. After the dinner, Bannon and Conway huddled with the candidate. Bannon remembers telling Trump, who at the time was trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits in the polls, “As long as you stick to the message”  —   by which he meant economic nationalism  —   “you have a 100 percent probability of winning. ” A week after the election, in an interview with the journalist Michael Wolff, Bannon offered a bold, sweeping sketch of what the vision might mean in policy terms: “Like [Andrew] Jackson’s populism, we’re going to build an entirely new political movement. It’s everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy. ” Of course, some of the conservatives Bannon intended to drive crazy possessed the congressional votes Bannon and Trump would need to advance this agenda. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a leading conservative in the House, told me in March, “I would argue that populism, as long as it’s rooted in conservative principle, is a darn good thing. ” Jordan was smiling as he said it, but the note of warning was hard to mistake. The last time the Republican Party controlled all branches of government in Washington was from 2003 to 2007. During that period, the United States military toppled Saddam Hussein, Congress delivered tax cuts for the wealthy and President George W. Bush appointed the reliably conservative jurist Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court. But in the collective view of conservatives, these years of the Bush presidency were mostly characterized by betrayal and disappointment. Goaded by Bush, congressional Republicans passed into law a new federal entitlement (prescription drugs for senior citizens, also known as Medicare Part D) ran up the deficit, promoted democratic ideals overseas in the feckless manner of Woodrow Wilson, considered a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and confirmed a Supreme Court chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr. whose swing vote would later save Obamacare from judicial evisceration. “My   line when I first ran in 2008 was, ‘Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House  —   and they blew it,’’u2009” Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told me. “Now we’ve got all three again, and I’m the guy who’s in Congress, not running for it. I don’t want to be in a position where we’re going to blow it one more time. ” Chaffetz and other House conservatives freely acknowledge that Trump is not cut from their cloth, but they say they could not care less as long as he gives them what they want. Selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia was “the best thing the president did in his first 50 days,” Chaffetz told me. He and his conservative colleagues have been cheered by Trump’s recruitment of former House colleagues and conservative stalwarts like Vice President Mike Pence Tom Price, the health and human services secretary and Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director. When Chaffetz and I spoke in March, he had met with the president twice so far  —   access he considered “such a huge sea change” from the stony silence Republicans say they encountered from the Obama White House. Most important, the Trump agenda’s first three projected legislative moves  —   the Obamacare repeal and replacement, an austere budget and tax reform  —   were intended to keep conservatives happily in Trump’s camp. In turn, when the agenda moved on to less conservative items like infrastructure and trade agreements, Trump and Bannon would fully expect Republicans, including Ryan, to remember whose message resonated most with   voters last year. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, is Trump’s chief point of contact on the Hill. When McCarthy was a college student and budding entrepreneur in Bakersfield, Calif. in the late 1980s, his girlfriend at the time, now his wife, Judy, gave him an autographed copy of Trump’s “The Art of the Deal. ” “I thought it was great,” he told me. In McCarthy’s view, Trump is a master of today’s media, much as Lincoln and Kennedy were in their own times. “He’s mastered instantaneous Twitter,” he said. “It’s like owning newspapers. ” Trump has found a kindred spirit in McCarthy, a coastal extrovert of ambiguous ideological portfolio who (unlike Ryan) would far rather talk about personalities than the tax code. And as the former minority leader in the California Legislature during the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger, McCarthy is experienced in the care and feeding of celebrity egos. Since Trump’s nomination, the two have spoken frequently by phone  —   to date, Trump has never been known to directly email or text anyone  —   about the cast of 535 characters with whom the president must now deal. But in the end, what Trump needs from the majority leader is not gossip but votes  —   216 of them, to be exact, in the House. And McCarthy’s recent track record in obtaining majorities has not been the greatest. In his previous capacity as House whip, he was thwarted by members of his own party when it came to subjects as diverse as reauthorizing a Patriot Act they deemed too intrusive, a farm bill they considered too expensive and a   bill they regarded as too lenient. His most reliable obstacles have been the three dozen or so House conservatives known as the Freedom Caucus, a    group of fiscal  . Early this year, McCarthy predicted to me that the new president would quickly subjugate the Freedom Caucus. “Trump is strong in their districts,” McCarthy told me. “There’s not a place for them to survive in this world. ” When we spoke on the morning of March 7, Trump assured me that he would not bully the   bill’s loudest Republican critics, like the Freedom Caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, on Twitter: “No, I don’t think I’ll have to,” he said. “Mark Meadows is a great guy and a friend of mine. I don’t think he’d ever disappoint me, or the party. I think he’s great. No, I would never call him out on Twitter. Some of the others, too. I don’t think we’ll need to. Now, they’re fighting for their turf, but I don’t think they’re going to be obstructionists. I spoke to Mark. He’s got some ideas. I think they’re very positive. ” But on March 21, in a meeting with the Freedom Caucus about the bill, Trump called out Meadows by name, saying, “I’m going to come after you, but I know I won’t have to, because I know you’ll vote ‘yes. ’’u2009” Meadows remained a “no” on the bill, and among conservatives, he was far from alone. One of the Freedom Caucus’s most outspoken members, Representative Raúl Labrador of Idaho, believes that the Trump White House was led astray by Ryan’s confidence that he knew what conservatives wanted when drafting the bill. “The legislation has to go through the body, not the top,” Labrador told me. “And if our leadership thinks now that we’re a unified body, that they can do things while ignoring us, that’s not going to happen. ” Labrador is an affable but decidedly stubborn    Mormon and former immigration lawyer who moved as a child with his single mother from Puerto Rico to Las Vegas. He was interviewed by the   for the post of interior secretary at Trump Tower last December  —   though Trump selected Labrador’s House colleague Ryan Zinke for the post a few days later. For now, Labrador and other Freedom Caucus members have been willing to blame House leaders like Ryan and McCarthy for drafting a health care bill that was not to conservatives’ liking. They aspire to remain philosophical whenever Trump’s daughter Ivanka persuades her father to propose initiatives like paid family leave, as he did during his   speech. “I didn’t stand up when he said that,” Labrador said. “That’s the only part of the speech where I thought, That’s not even close to what my party stands for. ” To House conservatives like Labrador, the Republican Party stands for limited government. To Trump and Bannon,   items like a border wall and infrastructure take priority over shrinking America’s debt. As Chaffetz admitted to me, “On the spending front, things could slip away really quickly. ” Trump’s budget blueprint is regarded by deficit hawks as fundamentally unserious, because it does not touch entitlements. Instead, it ravages perennial (and already  ) conservative piñatas like foreign aid, public broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts, in addition to downsizing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department  —   cuts that focus on the 27 percent of the federal budget that is not mandatory spending or devoted to defense. And for all the Republicans’ chesty rhetoric on cuts like these over the years, as a top House Republican staff member told me, “even the cabinet secretaries at the E. P. A. and Interior are saying these cuts aren’t going to happen. They’re going to protect their grant programs, their payments to states, their Superfunds. So how do you cut 31 percent of the E. P. A. out of the 5 percent that isn’t protected? And a bill that cuts all money for the N. E. A. will not pass. For Republicans in the West”  —   states whose vast rural areas benefit disproportionately from N. E. A. grants  —   “that’s a   killer. The campaign commercials write themselves. ” Labrador says he would defend Trump’s cuts but doubts that many of his colleagues would. “What he’s going to learn is that members of Congress are unwilling to take the tough votes,” he told me. “When he learns that, what’s going to be the next step?” In Labrador’s view, Trump’s only sane recourse will be to accept the need for entitlement reform. “At some point, the reality of the budget is going to have to hit him,” he said. “You can have this economic nationalism  —   Bannon is very smart, he clearly helped him with his messaging, it was so successful  —   but at some point, that theory is going to hit reality. ” When I spoke with Trump, I ventured that, based on available evidence, it seemed as though conservatives probably shouldn’t hold their breath for the next four years expecting entitlement reform. Trump’s reply was immediate. “I think you’re right,” he said. In fact, Trump seemed much less animated by the subject of budget cuts than the subject of spending increases. “We’re also going to prime the pump,” he said. “You know what I mean by ‘prime the pump’? In order to get this”  —   the economy  —   “going, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that’ll be going, we’re going to have to prime the pump to some extent. In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future. And that’ll happen. ” A clearer elucidation of Keynesian liberalism could not have been delivered by Obama. The one clear point of agreement between the Trump economic nationalists and the House conservatives is the one Ryan and Bannon identified over dinner in January: tax reform. But in so doing, they will be picking a fight that may prove perilous to Republicans. The    proposal that Ryan floated to Bannon has never been able to get past K Street lobbyists and wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers. When I asked Trump if he was a fan of the   tax, he replied: “I am. I’m the king of that. ” Almost no other country grafts an import tax onto a corporate tax, and it’s possible that enacting a   tax might well be in violation of the World Trade Organization’s agreements. Of course, Bannon has openly advocated abandoning the W. T. O. anyway, because of China’s membership in it. Still, the specter of new taxes on American corporations, higher prices for consumers and a jump in the dollar’s value may compel an unusual confederacy against the   plan. Labrador predicts that the   tax “will have very little political legs” in the conservative House, while Senator Lindsey Graham said in February that even in the   Senate, Ryan’s tax plan “won’t get 10 votes. ” Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat who has been outspoken in her willingness to work with Trump in spite of the broader stance of her party, says, “Let me tell you, I represent farmers, and anyone who tells me that farm country benefits from a high dollar needs to have a discussion with me. ” Perhaps the Republican faction most alarmed by Bannon’s economic nationalism is Washington’s military hawks. John McCain is among those not mollified by Trump’s pledge of enacting “one of the largest increases in   spending in American history. ” McCain scoffed when I brought this up to him. “Of course that’s simply not true,” he said. “When you look at 1981 and Reagan’s commitment to rebuilding the military, there’s no comparison to this 3 percent increase. It’s a shell game, my friend. ” Despite his obvious differences with Trump, McCain was willing to work with him  —   but Bannon’s presence seemed to confound such prospects. “It’s kind of interesting,” McCain said, “because I have decades of experience with Kelly, with Mattis, with Dan Coats, McMaster,” referring to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly Defense Secretary James Mattis Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence and H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser. “We discuss issues all the time. I think this is probably the finest   team that I’ve ever observed. It’s almost schizophrenic, in that I obviously don’t have conversations with Steve Bannon, but I do with Reince Priebus  —   he was my Republican chair in Wisconsin in my 2008 presidential campaign. So it’s almost a schizophrenic  —   that’s not the right word. A very divided kind of relationship. Paradoxical. ” McCain acknowledged to me that economic nationalism was a global movement and therefore not entirely “the making of some members of the Trump entourage. ” He then said: “But it is an articulation that I believe is strongly reminiscent of the 1930s. It certainly has unsettled our allies and friends around the world, there’s no doubt about that. ” Already, the senator asserted, the new administration’s bellicosity toward Mexico has increased the likelihood that its citizens will elect “a very     president. ” As for an import tax of the sort favored by Bannon and Ryan, “talk about harkening back to the 1930s,” he said. “It’s unbelievable to me that they somehow think if we start taxing goods coming across the border, that that’s somehow not going to be responded to by the Mexicans. Please. History shows this sort of action gets you into a trade war. ” Listening to McCain’s tirade, I found it evident that the Bannon Effect might well cost the Trump White House at least one Republican Senate vote on a number of central issues  —   this at a time when Republicans are clinging to a slender majority in the upper chamber. In such cases, Trump could find himself asking for something Obama was never able to count on: votes from the opposition. Early in the afternoon of Feb. 9, several Democratic senators met with Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House to discuss the Gorsuch nomination and other matters. Among them were Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. All four are moderates who are up for   in 2018 in states Trump carried in 2016 by titanic margins  —   the least of which, in Donnelly’s state, was nearly 20 points. If Democrats are to nurture any hopes of retaking the Senate majority, they will need to hold these four seats. But if Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin and Tester need to be seen back home as willing to work with Trump, the president needs them as well. Republicans enjoy a precarious    advantage in the Senate. On matters like the Supreme Court, Trump can count on all 52. On votes requiring a simple majority, any two of those Republicans could fall away, and Pence could preserve the win with a tiebreaking vote. But a trio of fiscal   (like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Mike Lee) military hawks (John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio) or social moderates (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito) could deny Trump a majority, unless he could swing at least one Democrat to his side. That February afternoon in the Roosevelt Room, Donnelly thanked Trump for negotiating with Carrier, the manufacturing company based in Indiana that had threatened to move jobs to Mexico before Trump   it into keeping many of them in Indiana. But Donnelly urged him not to view that episode as a “ . ” He requested the president’s support for his End Outsourcing Act, which would give preferential treatment in awarding federal contracts to businesses that kept jobs in America. The words were scarcely out of Donnelly’s mouth before Trump said, “I’m 100 percent for that, and I’ll do everything I can to help get it passed. ” He then asked Pence, who was in the room, “What do you think, Mike?” Trump was apparently unaware that Pence, as the governor of Donnelly’s state, had refused to back the senator’s initiative, claiming instead that burdensome federal regulations were to blame for outsourcing. According to Donnelly, Pence gamely replied, “If it’s like what Joe describes, I’ll do everything I can to help. ” Donnelly, a   Irish Catholic with a barroom guffaw, had met Trump once before. In January 2011, he was among the   Blue Dog Coalition, composed of conservative House Democrats  —   what remained of them, anyway, after the previous November’s disastrous midterms  —   who traveled to New York for their annual retreat. At a hotel conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the 20 or so Blue Dogs received a procession of guests, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President Bill Clinton. Only one of their scheduled appointments required that they go to their guest  —   and so they did, by bus, to Trump Tower. Trump greeted them in his boardroom, with its commanding view of Central Park. He was charming but also brash. “Remember, at that point he wasn’t really talking about running for office,” recalls one attendee, former Representative Dan Boren of Oklahoma. “But what strikes me was how he talked about the same issues  —   the wall, China  —   that became his stump speech years later. ” It was evident to the Blue Dogs that Trump was no Clinton or Bloomberg when it came to the issues. Says former Representative Ben Chandler of Kentucky, who was also in attendance: “The difference in terms of detailed knowledge of policy was stark. Trump just made bald assertions, really. ” Particularly memorable to Chandler was Trump’s insistence “that one of the best things the country could do was slap a massive tariff on the Chinese. ” Chandler continued: “He seemed not to understand that this would probably cause the entire world economy to melt down by causing a huge trade war. What I remember more than anything else was our general reaction afterward. And it was one of disbelief. ” Today Donnelly remains offended by what he calls Trump’s “crazy stuff,” as well as the alternative to Obamacare that Trump supported. But he does not begrudge Trump his showmanship. “He came to the Carrier plant,” Donnelly said. “I’ve been working on that issue since Day 1. I was begging people in the Obama administration to come out and talk to our workers. Donald Trump came out there. And Donald Trump talked to our workers. You can tell people you care. But it matters if you show up. ” The Senate Democrat who, to outward appearances, seems closest to Trump is Joe Manchin, who met face to face with the   in Trump Tower in December. Before the meeting, Bannon took the West Virginia senator aside. “The thing you need to know about Trump,” Bannon said, “is he doesn’t care about the Republican Party and he doesn’t care about the Democratic Party. He just wants to put some wins on the board for the country. ” In the meeting, Trump asked Manchin what could be done for coal miners. Manchin replied that he should support his Miners Protection Act, which would secure health benefits and pension funds for retired miners. According to Manchin, Trump replied that he would thoroughly support such a measure. Later that month, Manchin went on “Morning Joe”  —   the one show on MSNBC that Trump has been known to watch  —   to discuss, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Newtown school massacre, the need to expand background checks on gun purchases. Within an hour after Manchin was offscreen, his cellphone rang. It was Trump. Manchin was not completely forthcoming about the conversation, but he did tell me that he envisioned “a complete opportunity” for new   legislation. Unlike with Obama, he said, “no one thinks President Trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights. ” In his conversations with Manchin and Donnelly, Trump was essentially throwing his support behind a Democratic initiative without first checking with the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to ask what he thought of those proposals. Had he done so, the answer in each case would have been: not much. (Though on the coal miners’ legislation, Manchin said: “We’re seeing Mitch McConnell go from a ‘No, no and hell no’ to now dropping his own bill. Which is fine, so long as we get it. ”) Still, Trump may have little choice but to indulge Democrats on some of their pet issues, given that he will need their votes on two of the most critical pieces of his agenda: infrastructure and trade deals. Until now, Trump has divulged few details about this   infrastructure venture. On the campaign trail, he frequently cited America’s crumbling roads and bridges. He bemoaned the potholes defiling the runways at La Guardia Airport, where he parked his two planes. During Donnelly’s visit with Trump in the Roosevelt Room, the president “talked about the   Tunnel with the tiles falling off, which he would see on his way to La Guardia,” Donnelly recalled. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority denies that tiles are falling off the tunnel.) When I asked Trump for more specifics, he gingerly offered a few morsels: “This is something that’s going to be a real infrastructure bill, where real work is going to be done on bridges and roads and airports and things that we’re supposed to be doing. So it’s not just a political piece of paper. We’re going to do infrastructure, and it’s going to be a very big thing. ” Trump’s description struck me as uncharacteristically modest. Bannon had evoked a more gleaming vision when he told me: “Look, economic nationalism is predicated on a     infrastructure for the country, right? Broadband as good as Korea. Airports as good as China. Roads as good as Germany. A rail system as good as France. If you’re going to be a   power, you’ve got to have a   infrastructure. ” When I asked the president if his initiative might include such features, he replied: “Yes. It could, it could. You look at Japan and China, where they have the fast trains, and we don’t have any. You look at other countries where we used to be the leader, and now we’re the laggard. It’s not going to happen anymore. ” What also may not happen is House Republicans’ supporting a   bill that is at least somewhat reminiscent of the stimulus bill they unanimously opposed eight years ago. It’s also possible that even moderate Democrats in swing states may face pressure not to come to Trump’s rescue. After all, the president remains intensely unpopular among Democrats, who continue to nurture hopes that Trump is one Russia connection away from impeachment. As a senior White House official told me of Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court: “The comment we often get from Democrats is, ‘That’s a great nominee.’ Oh, so you’re voting for him? ‘I can’t.’ Why not? ‘My base would go crazy, and I’d be primaried.’ That environment has to change before we can have any of these conversations. ” On the morning of Feb. 2, two Democratic leaders on trade issues, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts  —   the ranking members of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees  —   met with Trump, along with a few of his advisers and Republican lawmakers. Trump had already greeted the day by threatening to yank federal funding from the University of California at Berkeley after acts of violence had forced the cancellation of the Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos’s speech on campus, and by taunting Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor ratings on “The Apprentice” during the National Prayer Breakfast. Disquiet lingered from Trump’s travel ban on refugees and his surly phone conversation with the Australian prime minister the previous week. Amid this chaos  —   entirely to Bannon’s liking and grating to nearly everyone else in Washington  —   actual legislative activity was slowly unfolding. Trump began the meeting by condemning the trade deals negotiated by his predecessors. The press pool was then ushered out before the Democrats could say anything in front of the cameras. When Neal was given a chance to speak, he informed Trump, Pence, Bannon, Kushner and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that America had in fact prospered as a result of past trade deals. Neal emphasized the crucial role that the Panama Canal played in the economic vitality of the Eastern Seaboard. Other than Ross, no one on Trump’s team seemed aware of this. “They were a bit surprised,” Neal later told me. He was also struck by the White House’s abhorrence of multilateral pacts, which seemed to him to be naïve. “The idea that you’re going to negotiate 148 bilateral agreements with W. T. O. members does not seem realistic,” Neal said. “The idea that we’re all of a sudden going to have a   agreement with Great Britain, that’s going to take years to do. ” Later, Neal said, Ross privately assured him that the Trump administration “would not give up on multilateral deals. ” Neal’s lecture signified the start of what is likely to be a long and at times contentious reckoning on the part of Trump and Bannon with the limits of their nationalist rhetoric. Of all the legislative lifts, none will be heavier than renegotiating trade agreements, which require a simple majority approval by both the Senate and the House. Scrounging up 15 Democratic senators who are willing to vote along with 52 Republicans would be a formidable enough task on any issue. But just as Democrats like Neal in the Northeast would fight for a trade deal that benefits their region, so will Republican lawmakers along the Southern border rebel at an effort to repeal Nafta. As McCain told me, “If you negated Nafta, it would send my state into a severe recession. ” He assured me that Trump’s nationalist posture would not provoke only regional opposition. He conjured up another Republican era  —   not Reagan’s, not Bush’s, but instead that of Herbert Hoover, when two Republican lawmakers joined with a Republican president to design a protectionist initiative that ultimately caused American exports to plummet during the Great Depression. “Somewhere,” McCain said with a dark chuckle, “Mr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley are smiling. ” On Thursday, March 23, Trump hosted a morning meeting of Freedom Caucus holdouts in the Cabinet Room. Jeff Duncan, a congressman from South Carolina who was present, told me that Trump told them: “I need you guys. We need to put up a win. It’s not just about needing to repeal Obamacare  —   though we do. It’s also that a win here sets up a win for tax reform and gives us momentum going into infrastructure. And if the bill fails, it could derail all of that. ” With customary bravado, Trump told the conservative members that he didn’t want to squeak by with just a   victory. “I want all 237 of you,” he said, according to Duncan, referring to the entire House Republican conference. That included the more moderate members, who had told Trump they felt that the White House wasn’t paying sufficient attention to their concerns. Later in the day, Trump hosted another meeting with the moderates, where Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania informed Trump that he remained a “no. ” According to an attendee, Trump angrily informed Dent that he was “destroying the Republican Party” and “was going to take down tax reform  —   and I’m going to blame you. ” Until that day, Duncan had been an unyielding “no” on the bill. The previous week, he delivered an impassioned speech to the vice president and other Republicans, insisting that this vote constituted “our generation’s rendezvous with destiny  —   a real chance to roll back the size and scope of the federal government, returning some liberty back to the people through our actions to repeal Obamacare. ” In a text to me, Duncan pointed to history: “39 men in a hot room in 1787 had the courage to break from the norm and empower a nation. ” But now the   congressman was, for the first time in his life, sitting across the table from a president who was personally appealing for his support. The White House was offering concessions and agreeing to them in writing. Duncan left the meeting and spent a few hours pondering, as he would later put it, “the greater opportunity we as Republicans have. ” By that evening, Trump had won Jeff Duncan’s vote. It wasn’t enough. The next afternoon, Ryan pulled the House health care bill, conceding that neither he nor the White House could muster enough votes. “You get about nine months to do the big things,” Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, told me at the beginning of the year. Nine months seemed like a long time then, the calendar spacious and the legislative   possibilities plentiful. But more than two of those months are gone already  —   and the path to future wins, as Trump foresaw in his meeting with the Freedom Caucus, is now more complicated. When he took office, Trump relished the prospect of becoming a new kind of deal maker in the White House. By the time I spoke with him in early March, however, he already seemed to be taking stock of the limits to his powers. He still saw himself as the closer in chief  —   but then that was “typical, I would think, of a president,” he mused. “Some more than others. ”</td>\n",

He says “instead, less government is more freedom. Higher wages and a better standard of life for all of us. ” Cruz blasts Trump for wanting to compromise on Supreme Court Justice and religious liberty and declaring his neutrality re:  .

He says Marco’s history and passion “inspires me. ” “Marco can paint a picture, can weave a tapestry of the promise of America like nobody else. ” Cruz says. Cruz welcomes Rubio supporters and says only two campaigns have a plausible path to the nomination —  “ours and Donald Trump’s. ” He says only his campaign has beaten Trump over and over again. Cruz asks if Republicans want a candidate who “shares your values” or someone who has spend decades opposing them. He says network executives who are “partisan Democrats” who are “ready for Hillary” want Donald Trump because Trump may be the one person who can lose to Hillary. He says the media aren’t going to decide the election —  “the voters will. ” He says this election will focus on three issues —  jobs, freedom, security. Cruz says the question is whether one understands the principles that made America great. Structure of Cruz’s speech remarkably similar to Clinton, another   politician. Cruz says that he his vision is of an America that is “greater tomorrow than it is today than it was yesterday. ” And then he talks about the three things his campaign is about. Clinton said voters voted for “our tomorrow” to be better than “our yesterday. ” And then talked about the three things her campaign was about. 10:45: This man is delusional.

He says Kasich sounded like he just won a governor’s race in Ohio.

He says even though he labored in obscurity for so long while being counted out, he out one foot in front of other and wants to remind voters that he will “not take the low road to the highest office in the land. ” 9:24: Kasich wants the rating agencies to eat their words about doubting Ohio. He says his whole life has been about creating opportunities for people. Kasich says “you want to believe again” that wages can rise, that we can have job security, and our children can have a better America than our mothers and fathers. He says he wants people in Ohio to know that he understands these tough issues because “he grew up in these situations” in a   town. He says his father was a mail carrier and his grandfather worked in the coal mines. Kasich says “I represent you” and it is his job is to “listen to  you” and then to and fix the problems. He says if he has to take some heat, “that is the price of leadership in America. ” 9:23: Kasich says he thought he could sneak in and grab a quick meal at a Cleveland restaurant and people started to cheer. Kasich says his reaction was “please don’t do that because you’re going to make me cry. ” Kasich says to have people believe in you and “bring people together and strengthen our country  …    ” He thanks the people of Ohio. “I love you. ” Kasich cites his record of leaving nobody behind —  not the   the working poor, the mentally ill. 9:21: Kasich says you appreciated good, peaceful protests when you went to college in the 1960s. Kasich says when you are in the arena and you leave your family to go out on the campaign trail and deliver a message to America because you believe you are the best qualified to be president and put it all out on the  along with your family  …     And he wants the crowd to give a great response to Marco Rubio. 9:20: Crowd chanting “USA, USA” and “Kasich, Kasich!” 9:19: Kasich says “you better believe it is about America” by “pulling us together” and “not pulling apart. ” 9:17: A victorious Kasich comes out on stage in Ohio. He is being lauded for holding serve and winning his home state (Is it a big deal if Ivo Karlovic or John Isner hold serve? ). 9:00: Clinton is up at the 9 p. m. EST hour and says she is closer to securing the nomination in November. She sounds hoarse and says her campaign has earned more votes than any other candidate —  Democrat or Republican. She congratulates Sanders for the vigorous campaign he is waging.  Clinton says voters voted for “our tomorrow to be better than our yesterday” because “that’s how American can live up to its potential, too. ” She asks supporters to “keep contributing” at her website.  She says this is one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. Clinton says the next president will  have to make a positive difference in America, keep Americans safe, and “bring our country together again. ” She says the next president cannot privatize Social Security. She talks up “equal pay for equal work. ” She speaks about “more good jobs in infrastructure” and “more good jobs in manufacturing” and “more good jobs in small businesses” and “more good jobs in clean energy. ” She says we’re going to “stand up” for the American middle class and American workers. Sounding like Trump and Sanders, she vows that China, Wall Street, and overpaid corporate executives will not take advantage of America. With no hint of irony whatsoever Hillary Clinton says we should avoid candidates who ”embarrass the country.” #Benghazi #ClintonEmails,  —   Dan Bongino (@dbongino) March 16, 2016,  Taking a shot at Sanders, she says every candidate “owes it to you to be clear and direct about what our plans cost” and how they will work. She sys that is the difference between running for president and being president. She says Trump is “wrong” and not “strong” for embracing torture, wanting a temporary ban on Muslims and wanting to deport illegal immigrants. 8:54: On CNN, Kasich says he is so appreciative of the people of Ohio for his third consecutive statewide win and he says he has “one more to go” in the fall because he is best positioned to beat Hillary Clinton. Kasich says he will “have all the money we’ll need” after tonight’s results. Kasich says “this is the little engine that can” and says he’ll get into a covered wagon and hope for a breeze. He compares himself to Cinderella teams in March Madness.

Exit polls, per CNN: Majorities want to continue Obama’s policies —  except in Ohio.  —   Overall, majorities of Democratic voters in each state said they hoped the next president would continue President Barack Obama’s policies, with the exception of Ohio, where about half said they hoped to see Obama’s policies carried on.  —   About 1 in 5 voters in each state said they made up their minds in the final days of the campaign, about on par with the average of 17% across all states with exit or entrance polls so far. That dipped to 1 in 10 in Florida. 5:25: Exit polls: 71% of GOP primary voters would definitely or probably vote for Trump if he were the nominee. 75% of GOP primary would definitely or probably vote for Cruz if he were the nominee. 5:25: More exit polling: 57% of GOP primary voters would be satisfied with a Trump v.

That dips to 6 in 10 in Ohio. Still, 1 in 5 or fewer in each of the five states voting today say they feel they personally are falling behind financially.  —   Majorities across three of the states voting today  —   Ohio, North Carolina and Illinois  —   said trade with other countries takes away U. S. jobs, while about a third in each of those states said it creates jobs.  —   Majorities of Republican voters across all five states today say they feel betrayed by the Republican Party, but not all were seeking someone from outside the establishment to carry the Party’s mantle. Majorities in Missouri and North Carolina said they wanted an outsider, as did about half in Florida and Illinois, and slightly less the half said so in Ohio.  —   Anger with the way the federal government is working is a bit more tempered here than it has been in other primary states. Between   and 4 in 10 GOP voters in each state said they were feeling angry about the way the government has been working.

The subject quickly turned to Christie, and Clinton wondered: “Why did he support him?” Matthews explained that Christie and others who support Trump “want a future” politically. “Did he have a debt?” Clinton mused. 1:00  —   From Breitbart’s Alex Swoyer: Kevin Bray, who is on the ground volunteering for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, told Breitbart News he was asked to leave a polling location on Tuesday where he was passing out flyers.

The County Clerk Shane Schoeller told Bray he had to leave the property since it was private property. Bray argued that he was 25 feet away from the door, obliging to the law, but that he shouldn’t have to leave if the premises is being used as a polling site. Breitbart News reached out to Schoeller for comment, but did not receive a response. Bray supplied Breitbart News with a photo and videos of the exchange.  12:58  —   WashPost: Trump is officially qualified to receive the nomination per RNC rules after his Marianas victory: See, in the Northern Marianas, Tuesday began 14 hours before it began on the East Coast.

In doing so, the Northern Marianas became the eighth state or territory in which Trump won a majority of the delegates. (The others: South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Hawaii and Mississippi.) And according to the rules of the Republican convention, a candidate must “demonstrate the support of a majority of the delegates from each of eight (8) or more states, severally, prior to the presentation of the name of that candidate for nomination. ” No eight states, no nomination. 12:39  —   Kasich presser: he appears to blame Trump for the violent Chicago protests, also says video on Trump’s comments about women offended him.

But these aren’t normal times, and our man Trump is not a normal candidate. And the people supporting him are not to be found out there on the grassy expanses of Hamptons lawn parties. No, you are far more likely to find them, as I have, downtown in Sag Harbor at the LT or the Corner Bar. Trump’s people out here aren’t in the     outright racist 25 percent who responded to his early campaign dog whistles like Labradors in a duck blind. His Hamptonites are by and large male and   or older, and they work with their hands for a living: They run machines in the factory on the Turnpike, or they paint houses and they repair plumbing some of them work for the big landscaping companies that trim the Gin Lane hedges and mow Sagaponack lawns. They tend to occupy the next 25 percent, in other words  —   the people a suddenly gentler Trump is working to win over now, those who feel left out and left behind economically, whose thirst was supposed to be quenched by Reagan’s   economics but who have been waiting nearly forty years for the first drop to fall. Many of the people who hire Trump’s legions out here run hedge funds and investment banks and real estate investment trusts. Most are Republicans, very wealthy Republicans, and as we know, these Establishment Swells are not happy with Mr. Trump  —   a while back they dispatched a   poodle called Mitt Romney to warn everyone how dangerous he is. But the people who work for Establishment Swells in the Hamptons, they like Mr. Trump a lot. You want to know why? Because after decades of promises and kabuki economics, they’ve figured out that the only trickle that’s ever reached them has been from a busted pipe after a winter freeze at one of the Swells’ summer houses, when they were called in to clean up the mess. 12:17  —   Do re mi fa so la  …     I will bring our jobs back to the U.

And, you know, when I look at what they’ve accomplished, and what they’ve been able to amplify in terms of saving lives —  by getting the price of drugs for   down in   Africa. It’s quite astonishing. And I would hate to lose that creativity, that imagination, that —   extraordinary flexibility. So, I think the answer is transparency. And there is no doubt that there will be  …     complete transparency about  …     donations. ” [No   question from Maddow. That’s all, folks.] So far, Maddow’s interview with Clinton is batting practice..  —   Jeff Greenfield (@greenfield64) March 31, 2016,  But when you have hundreds of thousands of people who are donating —   as they do —   I think that —   the best —   answer for that is what we have been doing for the last several years. And that is —   to be transparent about it. And let —   you know, let voters and others make their judgment. 9:48: Clinton doesn’t want any daylight between her and Obama and Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Garland. 9:43: She claims the media were in “awe” of the “ratings spike” with Trump and ironically claims that Trump basically went “unchallenged. ” [Clinton doesn’t give networks a ratings spike but she may have gone even more unchallenged.] 9:42: Clinton also blasts Trump for wanting to racially profile Muslims and “Cruz talking about policing Muslim communities. I can’t let that go unanswered. You know, I’m fighting to unite our country. And I don’t think you wait and then take on these outrageous, offensive, dangerous statements. ” 9:41: Clinton says she is not surprised that Sanders is still in the race. She says she went to June in 2008 “So, why would I expect anybody running against me to give up or quit before the process is done? I don’t expect that at all. I expect to win it. I expect that I will be the nominee. But I respect the process. And so I’m going to go after every vote in every contest going forward. ” 9:39: When Maddow asks Clinton if she thinks Trump is “manifestly unqualified to be president,” she responds, “Well, I’ll let voters decide that. ” She says if she faces Trump in a general election, she will be “going after him on issues. ” She says once she presses Trump on issues, voters who have been watching the election like a “  TV show are going to start saying, ‘He is scary. He is dangerous. We can’t  …     you know, we can’t let him go forward. ’” 9:29: Clinton says Trump is wrong about wanting to ban Muslims because “we have to form coalitions with predominantly Muslim nations. ” She also blasts Trump for “turning his back” on NATO sounds like Trump when she says NATO nations have to do more for themselves and “change some of their laws so they can be better partners with us. ” Clinton says “we will pay a big price” if we “build a wall around the United States. ” She adds that “You don’t, I think, get what you need out of NATO countries, all of them, including the smallest ones, by acting as though you could walk away from it. That could lead to the politicians and the forces within, let’s say the Baltic countries, who are favorable toward Russia, like   populations. To say to their fellow leaders, ‘Hey, you know what? The U. S. is outta here. We better start making accommodations with Russia.’ This all is a very complex set of circumstances that I don’t think he even has studied, or cares to understand. ” 9:28: Clinton blasts Trump for wanting to deport “11 or 12 million immigrants” and “going after Mexicans as rapists, and criminals. Insulting women. Barring Muslims. ” “You know, that reflects a certain strain of belief within the Republican party. It’s not totally outside the pale of what many of their leaders have been saying, campaigning on, winning elections on,” she says. “What they’ve done is to create the environment where someone emerges who is truly, in their view, a personality they don’t know what to do with. And on issues, they should look in the mirror. ” 9:25: Clinton says she is in favor of two strong political parties and thinks the GOP candidates “are much closer in their ideology and their position on issues than their personal animus perhaps suggests” even though there is a “lot of turmoil” going on that the party needs to sort out. She also adds that “whoever emerges, whether it’s one of the three, or they engineer some kind of convention coup  …     is going to be on the wrong side of what our county needs to do. ” She blasts the “  economics snake oil” that doesn’t work. [Clinton really sounds like she will be   going up against   in a potential general election against Trump.] 9:23: Clinton, like Trump, doesn’t like caucuses. She says that she got more votes than he did in the Arizona primary and “caucuses are a very unusual way for some states to” choose delegates. 9:20: Clinton says she doesn’t understand the argument made by the Sanders campaign that he will try to persuade super delegates to switch their allegiance to him at the convention. “Well, I don’t understand the argument. If I have more popular votes and more delegates, then I think it’s pretty clear that —   the people who turned out and voted —   chose me to be the nominee,” Clinton says. She dodges Maddow’s question about super delegates and whether the process is fair. 9:18: Clinton says she is gratified that she has more votes than anyone in this election. She says she has “a delegate count that is a higher margin between me and Senator Sanders than it ever was between me and President Obama. ” “So, I think we are on a very good path to getting the nomination. But I’m not taking anything, or anyone, or any place for granted. And I’m going to work really hard,” she adds. “Now, I hope that if I am fortunate enough to secure the nomination —  that we will come together as a party, as I did —   when we ended our very tough —   contest, and I endorsed —   then Senator Obama. I nominated him —  at our convention in Denver, and worked my heart out to get him elected. Because that’s what I think you do when a primary is over. ” 9:17: Clinton dodges Maddow’s question about whether she thinks Sanders will win Wisconsin. She says “we’ll see who turns out and votes on Tuesday. ” 9:05: Maddow explains that Trump made his comments on abortion to Matthews while she was taping her town hall with Clinton and she chased Clinton back down to ask her about Trump’s remarks. Clinton blasts Trump’s “inflammatory” and “destructive” rhetoric. She says Trump’s comments were “outrageous” and “dangerous. ” She says Trump is on the “real spear point of this assault on women’s rights. ” She says the “press needs to cover it” and the “outrage needs to be forthcoming. ”   taped around same time as      so both Todd  Maddow went back to candidates for reax on abortion,  —   Erika Masonhall (@ErikaMasonhall) March 31, 2016,  8:55: Trump on borders: “We have borders, we have to have borders.  We can’t let people just walk in and out of our country like we do right now.  We don’t have borders.  People are pouring into the country. ” Trump says the Border Patrol just want to do their jobs but they are not being allowed to after touting their endorsement of his candidacy. 8:54: Trump says he was not the guy who gave people nicknames in high school. 8:53: Trump: I don’t trust Mitt Romney. 8:50: Trump says he hopes nothing bad happens at the convention if he is denied the nomination but there will a lot of angry people. He describes why his candidacy is resonating: Look, people are being disenfranchised in this country.  They looked at me as somebody and they look at me as somebody that’s going to bring them back.  We haven’t had  —   you haven’t had a real salary increase, if you’re a   worker, in over 12 years.  They’re getting  —   it’s getting worse and worse and worse.  These are smart people.  These are people that have always had good jobs.  Their jobs have been taken away.  They’ve been sent over to China, Mexico and many other countries and they’re not doing as well as they were doing 12 and 15 years ago. 8:40: Trump for medical marijuana but not sure about legalizing recreational marijuana: I think that as far as drug legalization, we talk about marijuana, and in terms of medical, I think I am basically for that.  I’ve heard some wonderful things in terms of medical.  I’m watching Colorado very carefully to see what’s happening out there.  I’m getting some very negative reports, I’m getting some OK reports.  But I’m getting some very negative reports coming out of Colorado as to what’s happening, so we’ll see what happens. I think a lot of people are really looking at Colorado (ph) for prison reform.  I think our  —   as you know, our prison system is a disaster, it’s complete disaster all over the country.  Almost everything we have, Chris, if you want to know the truth, is a disaster. 8:38: Questioner asks Trump about gay marriage and transgender rights on MSNBC town hall event. Trump says he would have preferred the states making the decision on gay marriage “but the courts have decided. ”  On transgender rights, Trump says, “I would say that I’m going to go by the laws of the courts and the courts said  —   really, it’s very much up in flux right now, but I’ll go by the laws. ” [Why are Republicans participating in MSNBC town halls and why do they get tougher questions from   hosts than Democrats do from Fox News host in the rare instances they do a Fox News event?] 8:32: [MSNBC now airing Trump’s comments on abortion that dominated today’s media cycle. See below for full transcript of exchange.] He points out that this presidential election will be important for   advocates re: the Supreme Court. 8:27: Trump says “we going to be just fine” if China dumps U. S. Treasuries. Trump says nations we defend have to reimburse us and pay their fair share of costs. 8:26: Trump says minorities will support him because he is going to bring back jobs from China and Mexico. 8:25: Chris Matthews says Ryan is “not trustworthy” on enforcing immigration laws because he wants cheap labor. Matthews tells Trump “I’m with you” re: needing borders. 8:23: Trump on immigration: “I want a lot of people to come into the country, but they have to go through a process, they have to do it legally. We have to have a strong Southern border, drugs are pouring across the border, tremendous problems  —   we’re having tremendous problems with crime. You understand that, everybody understands it. We’re going to have very, very strong borders, we’re going to have a wall, it’s going to happen. ” He says the wall will be at least 35 feet and it’s getting higher all the time. He says we don’t have a country if we don’t have voters and assures Matthews Mexico will pay for it. Trump wants a “huge financial penalty” for employers who hire illegal immigrants and “it could be beyond a financial penalty. ” 8:18: When asked if he is more hawkish than Clinton, he says he is more intelligent. Despite Matthews’s repeated attempts to get him to take nuclear strikes off the table, Trump refuses to do, saying he would be a bad negotiator if he took anything off the table. Matthews asks, “Can you tell the Middle East we’re not using a nuclear weapon on anybody?” Trump says, “I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table. ” 8:15: Trump on temporary Muslim ban: “I think banning until we figure out what’s going on is an important thing. And I take a lot of heat for it and a lot of people like me for it, to be honest with you. ” Trump also says we have to “look at the mosques” and “we’re making enemies by doing nothing. I mean, we’re knocking down World Trade Centers, we’re shooting planes into the Pentagon. ” 8:12: Trump says people who have seen the   tape are saying “give me a break. ” He says not one person thought his campaign manager did anything wrong when he asked his audience and he says “I think a lot of woman would say give me a break. ” On her bruises, Trump says “I don’t know who crated those bruises.  I really don’t know.  I mean, you know, two days later, she comes in and she said she had some bruises. ” 8:07: Regarding the RNC pledge, Trump says “I have not been treated properly. People understand.  They haven’t stuck to the pledge. ” He wonders why   Republicans would want to turn their backs on millions of new voters and risk four liberal Supreme Court Justices if Clinton wins the White House. 8:05: Matthews: Romney is “up to something, he wants it, you can tell he wants it. ” He also says “Paul Ryan is making himself very clearly available with the statement he made last week. ” 8:04: When Matthews asks Trump what his leverage is at a GOP convention, he says “the voters. ” I have millions more votes than anybody else.  It’s not even close.  You know, because you have reported on it.  We’re setting records in terms of Republican primaries  …    . And that’s what my leverage. ” “Now, without me, they lose millions of  —   I think millions of people, and nobody is going to have a chance,” he says. “I will beat Hillary Clinton.  And I haven’t started that process yet. ” 8:03: At a town hall event in Green Bay, Chris Matthews says Trump has to win “NFL places” like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan if he is going to win the general election. 7:58: When asked if he is concerned about the Cleveland GOP convention, Kasich says, “we’ll be prepared. We work with the Secret Service, the Cleveland police, our National  —   the National Guard maybe to some degree. And the Ohio Highway Patrol. ” He says Trump’s language about potential riots “is not good. ” 7:52: Kasich says he would be the worst vice president when asked the question. When asked how he can govern Ohio while campaign so much, Kasich says there’s this thing called cell phones. Kasich says he had five jobs when he was out of government. 7:40: When asked how he will gain the trust of   voters, Kasich cites his work with Nina Turner, who is supporting Sanders and Kasich says may be mayor one day, to bring police officers an community members together. When Todd says that “Ohio the sixth worst state to raise a black child in” according to a  study, Kasich says there are political motivations behind nearly all studies.  He says he received 26% of the   vote, “which is unbelievable,” because “the community says basically we trust them, we know that he is doing his best to help us. ” 7:32: Kasich on whether   Korea should get nuclear weapons: I don’t think we want them to have nuclear weapons. We don’t need to have anybody else developing nuclear weapons, including Iran. If we find that, I’m for suspending that agreement. If we find out they’re developing, we’re going to have to act. No more nuclear weapons. We need to control this. These are the weapons of mass destruction. This is so bad, and that’s the thing I worry about for our children and for my daughters. 7:28: Kasich also says  many people in the political establishment hate him and say he can’t get along with people because he led the fight to balance the budget. 7:27: Kasich says he doesn’t hate the establishment but knows how to move it and has always been a reformer fighting for people who have had no voice. He adds: So here’s the problem. You send somebody down there that doesn’t understand how it works, then you’re going to have more drifting, and the only thing I can tell you is, we won’t drift if I’m there because I know how to move the system and I want you to know one other thing. My dad carried mail on his back. His father died of black lung, was a coal miner. My mother’s mother could barely speak English. All of my lifetime, I have been a reformer for people who have no voice. 7:25: When she asks Kasich what he can say to get her off of the Trump Train, Kasich says he has the best chance of beating Clinton and he offers solutions. 7:20: Town hall audience applauds when questioner Nina de Blasio says she is not related to Bill de Blasio. 7:18: Kasich says”I love that song by Rihanna. ” And says he loves New York and wishes they played it all the time. 7:17: Kasich again says the “strength of country in neighborhoods” and he says coming to New York is like “having a transfusion into life when you come here. This is a precious place, a precious city. It’s, frankly, the apple of the world, not just of the United States. But, that’s the way I feel, not just to the big towns, but to small towns as well. I mean, this is America, and we are strongest when we pull together. ” 7:15: Kasich says running for president has made him free because he can say what’s on his mind. 7:14: Kasich again slams Cruz for wanting to patrol Muslim neighborhoods. He says we need to get intelligence information from Muslims and “the easiest people in the world to attack are Muslims. ” “Our key, the key for America, and the president is to unite the civilized world, to get over the egos, the turf protection, and fight this. And, stop it now. Both killing ISIS in the Middle East, and the good intelligence that we need, and the policing that we need worldwide so we can be safe,” he says. “Now, if you’re going to polarize one group on a basis of religious tests, how are you going to get the information?” 7:11: Kasich won’t take the bait from Todd when Todd asks him if he thinks Trump is a “sexist. ” He says “I’m not going there. ” 7:10: Kasich on Trump: “It’s a roller coaster is the way I see him. Sometimes he calms down. In the last debate we had he was very calm. ” He then slams Cruz for saying we should patrol Muslim neighborhoods. He says Trump won’t be the nominee but has not figured out whether he would support him if he’s the nominee. 7:09: Kasich says he would have gotten rid of Lewandowski and when asked if Trump is responsible for the culture of his campaign, he says Trump has “driven people farther and farther into gloom and doom, and I don’t think that’s what a good leader does. ” Kasich, who has supported trade deals that has devastated   communities, says, “I think we’re doing pretty well in America. I mean, yeah, we have our problems, but look how much longer people live. Look at the improvements in education. Look at the improvements in transportation. ” He says “America is great” and asks, “does anybody deny the greatness of our country? Where would you like to live if you didn’t live here?” He says the key is “to convince the people here that if they can live a life bigger than themselves, and I can go, and I can get the jobs going, and take care of the national security, we’re going to be fantastic, and our kids are going to have a great life. I mean, what are we thinking about here?” 7:07: When asked what the organizing principle in today’s GOP is, Kasich says it’s jobs. But he says once we have economic growth, we can’t leave anyone behind: “The mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, the developmentally disabled, our friends in the minority community, everybody has to have a sense that they can rise. ”  He also mentions that “the spirit of our country rests in your neighborhood. ” 7:05:  Kasich at MSNBC town hall event with Chuck Todd on what’s going on in the GOP: Well, look, a lot of these people that are here today, they, they think the system is ripping them off. I mean they’re worried about their jobs, Chuck. They’re worried about getting a wage increase. They put their money in the bank and remember you used to get interest, remember that? And now they don’t give you anything. And they’re worried about their kids. We got a lot of kids here today I’m told and they’re worried are their kids gonna have a good America. And they’re worked up about it. And then I think on top of it, there have been politicians that have promised things that they could never deliver and then of course the talk show hosts and the television pundits and all that, they drive this as well. And people are stirred up. 6:45: Heidi   at one of Cruz’s Wisconsin campaign office: Fiorina  Heidi Cruz stop at Fond du Lac campaign office pic. twitter.   —   Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) March 30, 2016,  6:30: More on Sanders Being Left Off Ballot: Bonds says she’s confident Bernie’s name will be on June 14 ballot. ”It would be foolish for the District of Columbia to deny due process.”  —   Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) March 30, 2016,  DC Dem party registration was open until a 7:00 p. m. deadline, but the board of elections was only open until 4:45 p. m.  —   Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) March 30, 2016,    DC Dem chair Anita Bonds tells me city council needs to pass emergency legislation to get Bernie on ballot after  paperwork deadline snafu.  —   Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) March 30, 2016,  5:35: Sanders not yet on D.

On the important issue of the sanctity of life, what’s far too often neglected is that being   is not simply about the unborn child it’s also about the mother  —   and creating a culture that respects her and embraces life. Of course we shouldn’t be talking about punishing women we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they have to bring life into the world. ” 5:00: Trump campaign issues another statement on abortion comments: NEW Trump statement says he would NOT prosecute women getting abortions, only doctors performing them: pic. twitter.   —   Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 30, 2016,  4:53: Trump Says He’s More Intelligent than Hillary: Trump: I’m ”more intelligent than Hillary” https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   The Hill (@thehill) March 30, 2016,  4:50: Heidi Cruz confident about Wisconsin: ”I do think we will win Wisconsin,” @heidiscruz says during a stop with  @CarlyFiorina in Sheboygan. pic. twitter.   —   Shaquille Brewster (@shaqbrewster) March 30, 2016,  4:46: Jane Sanders, Bernie Sanders’s wife, says Trump will never be President because of his abortion comments in an interview with MSNBC. 4:45: Planned Parenthood, NARAL on Trump’s abortion comments: Reax to @realdonaldtrump abortion news from @PPact pic. twitter.   —   Noah Gray CNN (@NoahGrayCNN) March 30, 2016,  . @NARAL issues statement on  : pic. twitter.   —   Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) March 30, 2016,  4:39: Full transcript of Trump’s abortion comments per MSNBC: QUESTION: Hello. I am (inaudible) and have a question on, what is your stance on women’s rights and their rights to choose in their own reproductive health? TRUMP: OK, well look, I mean, as you know, I’m  . Right, I think you know that, and I  —   with exceptions, with the three exceptions. But pretty much, that’s my stance. Is that OK? You understand? MATTHEWS: What should the law be on abortion? TRUMP: Well, I have been  . MATTHEWS: I know, what should the law  —   I know your principle, that’s a good value. But what should be the law? TRUMP: Well, you know, they’ve set the law and frankly the judges  —   I mean, you’re going to have a very big election coming up for that reason, because you have judges where it’s a real tipping point. MATTHEWS: I know. TRUMP: And with the loss the Scalia, who was a very strong conservative  …    MATTHEWS: I understand. TRUMP:   …     this presidential election is going to be very important, because when you say, “what’s the law, nobody knows what’s the law going to be. It depends on who gets elected, because somebody is going to appoint conservative judges and somebody is going to appoint liberal judges, depending on who wins. MATTHEWS: I know. I never understood the   position. TRUMP: Well, a lot of people do understand. MATTHEWS: I never understood it. Because I understand the principle, it’s human life as people see it. TRUMP: Which it is. MATTHEWS: But what crime is it? TRUMP: Well, it’s human life. MATTHEWS: No, should the woman be punished for having an abortion? TRUMP: Look  …    MATTHEWS: This is not something you can dodge. TRUMP: It’s a  —   no, no  …    MATTHEWS: If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under law. Should abortion be punished? TRUMP: Well, people in certain parts of the Republican Party and Conservative Republicans would say, “yes, they should be punished. ”MATTHEWS: How about you? TRUMP: I would say that it’s a very serious problem. And it’s a problem that we have to decide on. It’s very hard. MATTHEWS: But you’re for banning it? TRUMP: I’m going to say  —   well, wait. Are you going to say, put them in jail? Are you  —   is that the (inaudible) you’re talking about? MATTHEWS: Well, no, I’m asking you because you say you want to ban it. What does that mean? TRUMP: I would  —   I am against  —   I am   yes. MATTHEWS: What is ban  —   how do you ban abortion? How do you actually do it? TRUMP: Well, you know, you will go back to a position like they had where people will perhaps go to illegal placesMATTHEWS: Yes? TRUMP: But you have to ban itMATTHEWS: You banning, they go to somebody who flunked out of medical school. TRUMP: Are you Catholic? MATTHEWS: Yes, I think  …    TRUMP: And how do you feel about the Catholic Church’s position? MATTHEWS: Well, I accept the teaching authority of my Church on moral issuesTRUMP: I know, but do you know their position on abortion? MATTHEWS: Yes, I doTRUMP: And do you concur with the position? MATTHEWS: I concur with their moral position but legally, I get to the question  —   here’s my problem with it  …    (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: No, no, but let me ask you, but what do you say about your Church? MATTHEWS: It’s not funny. TRUMP: Yes, it’s really not funnyWhat do you say about your church? They’re very, very strong. MATTHEWS: They’re allowed to  —   but the churches make their moral judgments, but you running for president of the United States will be chief executive of the United States. Do you believe  …    TRUMP: No, but  …    MATTHEWS: Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no as a principle? TRUMP: The answer is that there has to be some form of punishmentMATTHEWS: For the womanTRUMP: Yes, there has to be some formMATTHEWS: Ten cents? Ten years? What? TRUMP: Let me just tell you  —   I don’t know. That I don’t know. That I don’t know. MATTHEWS: Why notTRUMP: I don’t know. MATTHEWS: You take positions on everything else. TRUMP: Because I don’t want to  —   I frankly, I do take positions on everything else. It’s a very complicated position. MATTHEWS: But you say, one, that you’re   meaning that you want to ban itTRUMP: But wait a minute, wait a minute. But the Catholic Church is  : I’m not talking about my religion. TRUMP: No, no, I am talking about your religion. Your religion  —   I mean, you say that you’re a very good Catholic. Your religion is your life. Let me ask you this. .MATTHEWS: I didn’t say very good. I said I’m Catholic( LAUGHTER) And secondly, I’m asking  —   you’re running for President. TRUMP: No, no  …    MATTHEWS: I’m not. TRUMP: Chris  —   Chris. MATTHEWS: I’m asking you, what should a woman face if she chooses to have an abortion? TRUMP: I’m not going to do that. MATTHEWS: Why not? TRUMP: I’m not going to play that game. MATTHEWS: Game? TRUMP: You have  …    MATTHEWS: You said you’re  . TRUMP: I am  . MATTHEWS: That means banning abortionTRUMP: And so is the Catholic Church  . MATTHEWS: But they don’t control the  —   this isn’t Spain, the Church doesn’t control the governmentTRUMP: What is the punishment under the Catholic Church? What is the  …    MATTHEWS: Let me give something from the New Testament, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. ” Don’t ask me about my religion. TRUMP: No, no  …    MATTHEWS: I’m asking you. You want to be president of the United States. TRUMP: You told me that  …    MATTHEWS: You tell me what the law should be. TRUMP: I have  —   I have not determined  …    MATTHEWS: Just tell me what the law should be. You say you’re  . TRUMP: I am  . MATTHEWS: What does that meanTRUMP: With exceptions. I am  .I have not determined what the punishment would be. MATTHEWS: Why not? TRUMP: Because I haven’t determined itMATTHEWS: When you decide to be   you should have thought of it. Because  …    TRUMP: No, you could ask anybody who is    …    MATTHEWS: OK, here’s the problem  —   here’s my problem with this, if you don’t have a punishment for abortion  —   I don’t believe in it, of course  —   people are going to find a way to have an abortion. TRUMP: You don’t believe in what? MATTHEWS: I don’t believe in punishing anybody for having an abortionTRUMP: OK, fine. OK, (inaudible) : Of course not. I think it’s a woman’s choice. TRUMP: So you’re against the teachings of your Church? MATTHEWS: I have a view  —   a moral view  —   but I believe we live in a free country, and I don’t want to live in a country so fascistic that it could stop a person from making that decision.

In the United States, the people make the decision, the courts rule on what’s in the Constitution, and we live by that. That’s why I say. TRUMP: Yes, but you don’t live by it because you don’t accept it. You can’t accept it. You can’t accept it. You can’t accept it. MATTHEWS: Can we go back to matters of the law and running for president because matters of law, what I’m talking about, and this is the difficult situation you’ve placed yourself in. By saying you’re   you mean you want to ban abortion. How do you ban abortion without some kind of sanction? Then you get in that very tricky question of a sanction, a fine on human life which you call murder? TRUMP: It will have to be determined. MATTHEWS: A fine, imprisonment for a young woman who finds herself pregnant? TRUMP: It will have to be determined. MATTHEWS: What about the guy that gets her pregnant? Is he responsible under the law for these abortions? Or is he not responsible for an abortion? TRUMP: Well, it hasn’t  —   it hasn’t  —   different feelings, different people. I would say no. MATTHEWS: Well, they’re usually involved. Anyway, much more from the audience here at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay. We’ll be right back.

       "        <td>‘Have you seen the latest polls? I’m beating Hillary. ” Donald Trump was on the phone with a man he had never met, a Republican delegate in Pennsylvania. It was May 2, one day before the Indiana primary election, and the private plane bearing his last name in gigantic letters was taxiing along a runway at Indianapolis International Airport. Trump proceeded to quote the numbers to the man in Pennsylvania: ahead of Clinton by 2 points in that day’s Rasmussen poll, 3 points behind her in the previous week’s George Washington University poll. These were the only two national polls at the moment that did not show him lagging behind the Democrat by a wide margin in the general election, but Trump was a businessman who preferred to negotiate using numbers that were in his favor. “I’d love your support, Phil,” the candidate said as he squinted at his own handwriting, a scrawl in black marker on a piece of paper. “You know, you’re the only delegate I’ve talked to. But I saw you on television, and you appreciate what I do  —   I won your county by a massive amount, and you’re respectful of that, and I just appreciate what you’ve said: ‘Having a moral obligation to support the winner’  —   I hadn’t heard a delegate say that before. ” Trump thanked the delegate and hung up just as the Boeing 757 took off, en route to a final campaign stop in South Bend. He settled into his plush leather seat, beside a large cardboard box containing various documents relating to the Trump Organization’s sundry enterprises. “It’s hard negotiating elevator rates while you’re running for president,” he said. On the table before him were some notes for a speech on law and order prepared by his senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, who sat behind the candidate around a table with a few other aides, including Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. On the more conventional presidential campaigns I have covered  —   George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney  —   the candidate’s mobile inner sanctum was a hive of activity, the advisers hovering constantly over their boss, rattling off the latest polling data or words of unsolicited advice from a big donor. On Trump’s plane, the aides spoke when spoken to and otherwise kept to their labors on their laptops. Trump’s attention was on the large   TV on which various Fox News pundits were forecasting his probable victory in Indiana’s Republican primary the following day and the bleak implications for his opponent Ted Cruz. The Republican contest, they all seemed to agree, was pretty much over. The    billionaire now appeared destined to be Clinton’s opponent in the general election. The Fox commentators, even the ones who favored Trump, seemed to struggle for the words to convey this eventuality. The candidate took in the good news with an oddly inert expression. “Maybe I’ll get beat tomorrow,” he said, for at least the third time that day. Not a single poll had given him cause for worry. But for all his swagger, Trump had an awareness of unseen,   contingencies that held his triumphalism in check. He was compulsively superstitious twice on other plane trips I had seen him toss a few granules of salt over his left shoulder after eating. And here he was, on the day before he would effectively clinch his nomination, calling a single obscure delegate in a state he had already won in a landslide  —   an implicit nod to the forces aligned against him before resuming the affect of indomitability. On the TV, Fox had moved on from the election to footage of the smoky aftermath of a bombing in Baghdad. Trump rose from his seat and walked over to the screen for a closer look. “Boy, this ISIS,” he murmured. I asked Trump if he had ever been to Iraq. “Never!” he said, sounding horrified by the thought. “What’s the most dangerous place in the world you’ve been to?” He contemplated this for a second. “Brooklyn,” he said, laughing. “No,” he went on, “there are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously. ” It was a stark reminder of what set Trump apart from every other politician in recent memory who had occupied his current position: how little of the world he had seen beyond the archipelago of boardrooms, golf courses and   hotels he inhabited, how utterances that by now would have torpedoed a more normal campaign continued to roll off his tongue with impunity. That Trump would emerge as the last candidate standing from a field that once included 17 seemed at times unimaginable over the five spasmodic weeks I had spent intermittently in the company of the Trump campaign. More than during any other stretch over the past year, everyone  —   at times even Trump and his loyal advisers  —   seemed hellbent on denying him victory. Now it was clear that there would be no technicalities, as some had long suspected, to keep the victory from him no   fatal error, as so many had assumed. No, this was it: the final stage of a process by which Americans accepted that this man, wholly unlike any politician they had ever seen, was going to definitely, not maybe, become the   of one of the two political parties of the most powerful nation on earth. On the TV, the Fox News pundits were speaking consolingly of the     Cruz’s political future. Standing in front of the oversize screen, Trump scoffed: “I don’t think he has much of a future. ” He returned to his seat and proceeded to scratch out a few notes for what would be his final speech as a Republican competing for the nomination. “This is probably the most successful club anywhere in the world,” Trump informed me. “I have the best building and the best location. ” It was early on the evening of March 23 at the   bar of    Trump’s private resort in Palm Beach, Fla.: an estate that was envisioned after the death of its original owner, the cereal magnate Marjorie Merriweather Post, as a winter presidential retreat and that could conceivably be, by next January, a   Camp David. Trump strolled in wearing a navy blazer and white dress shirt  —   no tie  —   and appearing slightly tanner than usual. We were supposed to have met late that morning, to begin my several weeks of following the campaign. But his communications director, Hope Hicks, emailed shortly before the scheduled  : “Something has come up, and the boss is going to be occupied for a few hours. ” I deduced  —   correctly, as it turned out  —   that Trump had ditched me for a golf game. It was the first sunny day all week, and the previous evening the candidate had crushed Cruz in Arizona, which occasioned some celebration. Now Trump apologized for having kept me waiting. “Are you going to have dinner with us tonight?” he asked. Trump sat down across the table from me and next to Hicks and Lewandowski, who were poring over their smartphones. Opposite them loomed a painting of a much younger Trump in tennis whites. A waiter materialized and poured him a Coke. (Trump says that he has never touched alcohol.) The month of March had been Trump’s best thus far as a presidential candidate. Although he had, early on, privately rated his chances of winning the Republican nomination as one in 10, he now seemed poised to do just that. On March 1, he clobbered Cruz across the South, winning five of the seven primaries in the region that day  —   victories that wiped out hope, among the many Republicans who viewed Trump as an apocalyptic threat to their party, that Cruz’s support among evangelicals would form a bulwark against the interloper. Two weeks later, Trump decisively won Illinois and North Carolina, and seemed to have squeaked by in Missouri, though the narrow margin there meant that the result wasn’t yet official. More astounding, he won Florida, beating its native son, Senator Marco Rubio, by nearly 19 points and forcing him out of the race. Less than two months earlier, the   senator was the Republican Party’s favorite son: precocious and upbeat but exquisitely calibrated, never in danger of wandering    —   in short, the antithesis of Donald Trump. By early March, Trump had baited him into the tar pit, where he was reduced to questioning the penis size of the man who called him “Liddle Marco. ” “He was branded beautifully,” Trump said, slouching contentedly in his chair. He turned to Lewandowski. “Did they ever announce the results of Missouri?” “Sir, they’re still certifying the counts of the delegates,” Lewandowski said. “Am I leading? Have they taken anything away from me?” “So far you’ve lost a net of three votes. ” “So when will we know?” “They’re trying to certify this by Friday. They’ve allocated 25 delegates to you, 15 to Cruz  —   there’s still 12 out there. ” Trump’s brow wrinkled. “So are they saying I won Missouri by doing that?” he asked. “Not yet,” Lewandowski patiently explained. “You’ve won a series of congressional districts. You won five of them, which is 25 delegates. Cruz won three  —   so 15 for him. ” Distaste clouded Trump’s face. Like most Americans, he had until recently been almost completely ignorant of the obscure mechanics by which a candidate became the party nominee. To win the nomination, he needed the support of 1, 237 delegates. Achieving this was not as straightforward as simply winning the most votes in primaries. In each state, lifelong party officials largely controlled the   process. This was the Republican establishment’s last front in its war against Trump  —   and Trump feared, not without cause, that his rivals would resort to whatever connivances were necessary to deny him a 1, 237 majority and throw the Republican convention into a melee of multiple balloting and    . “What I don’t like,” Trump said, “is Cruz has a guy working for him”  —   his campaign manager, Jeff Roe  —   “that’s one of the most powerful guys in Missouri. So when I hear there’s a revote”  —   there wasn’t, actually  —   “I know too much about politics, so I get it. And I don’t like it. ” Cruz was, perhaps, the only candidate as   among Republican Party hands as Trump was, but Trump plainly saw the Cruz campaign’s machinations as a reflection of the party establishment’s ferocious determination to stop him. It was no secret that many Republicans viewed Trump as an explosive device poised to obliterate in a single blast the party’s economic orthodoxy and its ability to project an image of tolerance. Trump himself had vowed to blow up the party’s “rigged system. ” And yet he remained somewhat puzzled as to why the party was so opposed to him. In his view, he had arrived on the scene as something of a gift to the G. O. P. He had attracted to the polls hordes of Americans who had previously given up on the party, or on politics as a whole. Viewers were tuning in to the   Republican debates in   numbers  —   and this, he argued, was “100 percent Donald Trump. ” The party had become too obsessed with ideology. “One thing I’ve seen over the years,” he observed, “is that the Democrats stick together, and the Republicans eat their young. That’s why they lose so many elections. You know, a normal, very nice, very likable Republican would be hard pressed to win. ” Trump did not accept the concern that his more incendiary statements had alienated women and minorities and thereby made him unelectable. “I’m going to be better to women on women’s issues than Hillary Clinton and everybody else combined,” he would later tell me. Now, sipping his Coke, he cited his     view that Planned Parenthood was a valuable women’s health care organization, albeit one that should not receive federal funding as long as it performed abortions. “Frankly, for the general election I think that’s a very good issue for me,” he said. “Structurally, it’s very hard, almost impossible, for a heavily conservative Republican to win, because of the Electoral College. Whereas I bring in Michigan. Look at what I did in Michigan  —   I won it in a landslide, it wasn’t even close. So I bring in Michigan. I maybe bring in New York. Republicans don’t even go for the general election to campaign in New York, because there’s no chance. ” “Illinois!” Hicks chimed in. “I win Illinois,” Trump said of a state in which, by the latest polling from early March, he was trailing Clinton by 25 points and which a Republican had not won since 1988. “The reason they did an autopsy of the party,” Hicks said, referring to the Republican National Committee’s internal analysis following the defeat of 2012, “was because the party was dead! People are accusing Mr. Trump of killing the party  —   well, that’s already been done. He’s bringing the party back to life!” Trump said: “By the way, I’m going to do great with the   vote. One poll came out saying Donald Trump’s going to get 25 percent of the   vote. ” Trump was referring to last September’s SurveyUSA poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percentage points. (In 1960 against Kennedy, Nixon received 32 percent of the black vote. Since then, the highest share of the black vote any Republican nominee has received was Reagan’s 14 percent in 1980.) “And I said, Huh  —   why not more? I’m going to do great with the  . I’m going to bring back jobs. And I’ve had good relations with them. ” And, he said, “I’m going to do far better with Hispanics than anyone thought. I have thousands working for me. When this is over, one of my first pictures is going to be me at the Doral”  —   his golf resort near Miami  —   “with a thousand of my people working there, most of whom are Hispanic and all who love Trump. ” As we moved to the patio for dinner, Trump signaled for Lewandowski and Hicks to join us, which seemed to surprise them. We were seated at a table that afforded a view of the beach while also placing the resort’s owner in the center of everyone else’s attention. Trump accepted the greetings, congratulations and selfie requests with rote magnanimity  —   posing for the camera phones, his forced wince of a smile looked as if someone were grinding a shoe into his toe  —   before dispatching each   with an “Enjoy your evening. ” He regarded the parade of men in   or   blazers with a flicker of amusement. “Right out of central casting,” he said. Melania Trump joined us on the patio Trump doted on her throughout the meal, often touching her shoulder or leg and calling her “baby. ” His eldest son, Donald Jr. sat with his wife at a nearby table, as did Trump’s grandchildren and his youngest son,    Barron. Melania’s   and Lewandowski and Hicks’s deferentiality  —   both referred to Trump as “sir” and “Mr. Trump”  —   lent the whole tableau an Old World texture, like a Habsburg patriarch in repose. “This is fun, right?” Trump exclaimed. “Really! We’re having a good time!” Sometime after 10, he and his wife rose from the table and said good night. Back in his bedroom just before midnight, he checked his Twitter feed, as he often did when, he told me, he felt the passing urge to “knock the crap out of” somebody. Tonight, one of his eight million Twitter followers had tweeted a pair of photographs: a flattering image of Melania alongside one of Cruz’s wife, Heidi, with a sort of   expression, with the caption “A picture is worth a thousand words” and the hashtag #NEVERCRUZ. Trump retweeted it from his own account  —   his last public statement of the day. The next morning, a Thursday, Lewandowski drove Hicks and me from    to Trump’s nearby golf resort in one of the candidate’s many cars. “I’m Corey,” Lewandowski, in shorts and loafers, explained to the security guard at the entrance. Then, more emphatically: “With Mr. Trump’s campaign. ” The guard eyed him skeptically as we drove past. Though he was Trump’s top aide, Lewandowski was viewed by some political observers in Washington as a glorified body man  —   he seldom left the candidate’s side, and he lacked the   credentials usually characteristic of   campaign strategists. Lewandowski handled the details, not the vision. He was not a guru. Had he been, Trump, who is his own guru, would not have hired him. In his briefcase, Lewandowski carried a bulky black binder. It contained virtually everything of significance in Trump’s political universe: the daily, weekly and monthly master schedules the full staff list with everyone’s contact information a similar list of the campaign’s various contractors daily talking points for staff and surrogates a running tally of the delegate count a list of Trump endorsers a metrics chart of field activities in each state, including the daily number of calls made and doors knocked position papers on each major issue various documents requiring the candidate’s signature and drafts of coming speeches. When he was not taking orders from the candidate, he was on the phone executing them, pacing around with his hand cupped over the receiver like an offensive coordinator furtively calling in plays. What Lewandowski did have in common with David Axelrod, Karl Rove and other marquee strategists was a romanticized view of his candidate  —   one that even Trump, for all his   didn’t seem to share. Lewandowski saw him as a     tilting against a party elite that had not seen fit to embrace either of them. Though Lewandowski had kicked around in the political circles of New Hampshire for much of the past two decades, he had never seen thousands of people turn out to greet a candidate there the way they did his new boss. Nor had he expected the campaigns of more experienced candidates run by   consultants to collapse so quickly and spectacularly in the face of Trump’s challenge. Today, 15 months into the job, Lewandowski plainly admitted that he was not this campaign’s “architect. ” Instead, he described himself to me as “a jockey on American Pharoah. You hold on and give him a little bit of guidance. But you’ve got to let him run. ” Over coffee in the club’s sunny dining room overlooking the links, Lewandowski and Hicks joked about the “toxic infighting” that some media outlets had claimed was bedeviling the campaign. Its four principals  —   Lewandowski, Hicks, the deputy campaign manager, Michael Glassner and the   director, Dan Scavino  —   were, Hicks insisted, extremely close. They had also been made aware of two things by Trump: There was only one star of the campaign, and there was also only one communications director. Unlike most who held her job title, Hicks did not tend to the campaign’s messaging strategy. Nor did Hicks, who is 27, see it as her job to spend evenings sharing    insights over drinks with the traveling press corps. The rest of the Trump team felt similarly. This, combined with the campaign’s unusually long blacklist of media outlets it deemed unfair or unfriendly, had left reporters with few of the usual means of interpreting the campaign’s inner doings, requiring them to rely instead on more   sources. Among those was Trump’s longtime adviser Roger Stone, an inveterate   in the dark seams of American politics who lived by the credo that, as he put it, “the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. ” Depending on whom you believed, Stone had either been dismissed by Trump last August or had quit. Trump had also parted company with Stone’s former protégé, Sam Nunberg, who worked for Trump from 2011 until last August, when it was disclosed that he had previously posted racist messages about Obama and the Rev. Al Sharpton on his Facebook page. Nunberg no longer spoke to the candidate Stone remained on good terms with Trump but communicated with him infrequently, usually when Trump called to compliment him on a TV appearance. Both harbored an intense dislike for Lewandowski, who they believed had tried to wall off their access to the candidate  —   Stone, whose formative years were spent working for the   campaign of President Richard Nixon, described Lewandowski to me as having “all of Bob Haldeman’s negative traits and none of his good ones”  —   and merrily disseminated tales of his imminent professional demise. Outside Trump World, these whispers dovetailed with a sense in the media and the political class that a campaign that began as an odd novelty was evolving into something darker. Trump’s rhetoric had been inflammatory since his announcement speech in June, in which he castigated Mexico for sending “rapists” to the United States in December, after a    team of Islamic State sympathizers shot 35 people in San Bernardino, Calif. he issued a statement calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on. ” Now reports and videos were surfacing of Trump supporters flinging racial slurs and, sometimes, attacking protesters at his rallies. “If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?” Trump told a crowd in Iowa on Feb. 1. “Seriously. O. K.? Just knock the hell  —   I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. ” Then on March 8, Lewandowski grabbed the arm of Michelle Fields, then a reporter for Breitbart News, when she approached Trump at a campaign event at the golf club where we were now sitting, leaving bruises. Fields filed a complaint, and the stories now circulating portrayed a Trump campaign in a state of “serious existential threat,” as one Politico article put it. Stone had been quoted in that article, and Nunberg, who would later announce his support for Cruz, had reached out to Fields through an acquaintance and suggested lawyers to her. Inside Trump World, these matters were regarded as drastically overblown. Trump had no intention of punishing Lewandowski for the Fields incident the way Cruz had thrown his national spokesman Rick Tyler overboard the month before for   Facebook and Twitter posts. Nevertheless, Trump quietly issued the order that his rally venues for the time being be smaller, and thus more easily controlled, even as he stood by his campaign manager and defended his revolution as a nonviolent one. At the golf resort, I brought up the more strategic criticism that had been leveled at the campaign, that Trump needed to turn his guerrilla squad into something resembling a more conventional operation, and asked Lewandowski and Hicks how that might happen. “Ever since we won Nevada, all these guys have been calling us and saying we had to build out the team,” Hicks said. The campaign’s core staffers had received this advice with   recognizing it as a worldview at odds with their own  —   and from time to time would draw up imitation organizational charts imagining what an expanded Trump World would look like: But a small cloud was gathering in the otherwise unblemished sky over Palm Beach. That evening, a Wall Street Journal article by Reid J. Epstein was published online under the headline “Ted Cruz Gains in Louisiana After Loss There to Donald Trump. ” Epstein wrote that although Trump had won that state’s primary, Cruz’s team was exploiting the state party’s arcane rules to help draw many of the delegates their way. The man Trump called “Lyin’ Ted” was running a campaign operation that, in the view of Trump World, wasn’t half as brilliant as the media had given it credit for. After all, who had won the evangelical vote in South Carolina? Who had swept nearly all of the South? Who had snatched victory in Missouri from the jaws of Cruz’s supposed wizard Roe? Still, Cruz’s campaign had found a different way to win. Trump read the story at    the next day. Unnerved, he called Roger Stone. “Can they really steal this thing from me?” Stone later recalled Trump asking him. Stone told him that yes, such a feat was entirely possible. The last time anyone in the Republican Party had felt the need to prepare for a brokered convention was 1976, when former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California mounted an insurrectionary challenge to President Gerald Ford. Among the operatives managing Ford’s short but intense   fight was Paul Manafort, a    protégé of Ford’s campaign manager, the future secretary of state James Baker. Manafort went on to advise several subsequent Republican presidential campaigns, but since the  ’80s, much of his counsel had been devoted to helping foreign leaders including Ferdinand Marcos and Vladimir Putin’s ally in Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. Still, with his pinstripe suits and   deftness, he represented a steady and   contrast to Trump’s whippetlike campaign manager. He was also more than 25 years Lewandowski’s senior  —   a true peer to Trump, who often referred to his traveling entourage as “the kids. ” As it happened, he lived on the 43rd floor of Trump Tower, and was Stone’s former business partner. At Trump’s request, Manafort had dinner the evening of March 24 with the candidate at   . Manafort offered his services pro bono  —   he was already plenty wealthy, and presumably preferred an optimized blend of influence and independence. Four days later, on the morning of Monday, March 28, members of the campaign staff assembled at the Washington office of Donald McGahn, Trump’s campaign lawyer, for a secret meeting. The team conferred for three and a half hours. The manager of Trump’s shoestring delegate operation, Ed Brookover, and his deputies Brian Jack and Alan Cobb, began with a review of the campaign’s current   status state by state. But midway through the presentation, the discussion spilled over into a deeper examination of the state of the campaign  —   of how the candidate’s message should be shaped and how his operation should be broadened. As the newcomer in the room, Manafort was deferential but also pointed in his observations. He told Lewandowski he was taking on a new role now, according to two people present at the meeting. He was bigger than just a campaign manager, he said. Senators would want to meet with him directly, and he should leverage that when he was in Washington. Such leveraging was, of course, exactly the skill of an establishment hand like Manafort, not an outsider like Lewandowski. (A spokesman for Manafort said he did not recall this being said.) The next morning, March 29, Lewandowski turned himself in to police in Jupiter, Fla. and was charged with simple battery for the incident with Michelle Fields. Ultimately the state attorney for Palm Beach County would decline to prosecute him. What lingered in significance, however, was the complete senselessness of his denial that he had ever touched Fields. (The episode was captured on video.) Instead, Lewandowski had followed the example of his pugnacious boss, which he and Hicks characterized to me during our meeting at Trump’s golf resort in Palm Beach: Don’t back down. Double down. Trump, meanwhile, had other problems. He was now campaigning in Wisconsin, where   forces were mounting a fierce and skillfully coordinated effort to deny him the nomination at the convention. “I’ve never said this before, but if I don’t win it on the first ballot, the dishonest establishment will never allow me to win,” Trump told me aboard his 757 on the morning of April 5. We were departing Milwaukee, where voters were going to the polls, and the Fox News pundits on his TV were dissecting what had been the worst   stretch of his young political career  —   one that had begun with his campaign manager’s arrest. When one commentator made reference to Trump’s recent “unforced errors,” Trump said, “O. K. you can turn the sound down now. ” Scavino obliged. Referring to the results of the Wisconsin primary that would arrive that evening, Trump asked me, “What do you think is going to happen?” “You’re probably going to lose,” I said. He shrugged. “I have the whole machine against me. ” Surveying his recent setbacks, however, he allowed that he had perhaps made some mistakes. He had come to regret his decision to retweet the Heidi Cruz photo that night at    which had dogged him for weeks now. “I could’ve done without it,” he gruffly acknowledged. “Some people were offended. ” I asked him if it was strategically wise to have spent the past week in Wisconsin repeatedly attacking the state’s governor, the former presidential candidate Scott Walker  —   who, granted, was a Cruz supporter but who also enjoyed an 80 percent favorability rating among the state’s Republicans. “Maybe not,” Trump mumbled. “We’ll see. ” Then there was his interview the previous week with the MSNBC host Chris Matthews, who asked him whether his   views meant that he also supported criminal penalties for a woman who had an abortion. Trump had replied that yes, there should be “some form of punishment. ” Now he argued to me, rather unconvincingly, that he had been misinterpreted: “I didn’t mean punishment for women like prison. I’m saying women punish themselves. I didn’t want people to think in terms of ‘prison’ punishment. And because of that I walked it back. ” A more believable explanation, furnished by a senior adviser for the Trump campaign, is this: Trump, a serial   initially saw nothing wrong with his remark and refused to walk it back. Only when every network chief executive and over 100 media outlets besieged the Trump campaign with requests for additional comment on how women should be punished for abortions did the Trump campaign turn to an ally: Chris Christie, whose tenure as the Republican governor of the blue state of New Jersey had given him experience placating both social conservatives and the moderate voters Trump hoped to attract in the general election. A member of Christie’s political team helped draft a statement that essentially repudiated Trump’s earlier one. In any other presidential campaign, this string of failures would have cost someone his or her job. But no heads had rolled in Trump World  —   a tacit acknowledgment by the candidate, perhaps, that responsibility for the campaign resided in the man with the office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower. The campaign’s inner circle remained intact Hicks now sat directly behind Trump on the plane, pecking away at her laptop alongside Lewandowski, whose eyes were haunted with fatigue and who had lost so much weight recently (15 pounds, he would later tell me) that his blue blazer drooped like a cloak around his shoulders. I asked Trump if his campaign manager’s job description had been affected by recent developments. “Zero,” he insisted. That evening Trump lost Wisconsin by 13 points to Cruz. Further setbacks followed in Colorado and Wyoming, where Cruz’s team outmaneuvered Trump’s in the   process, as even some of Trump’s staff members would concede to me. Lewandowski thought highly of the 1993 Bill Clinton campaign documentary “The War Room,” and admiringly regarded Clinton’s team as a roomful of “killers. ” The able but   Trump delegate crew, which included Jack, Brookover and Barry Bennett  —   all alumni of Dr. Ben Carson’s recently shuttered campaign  —   did not seem to have the appetite for the jugular that Cruz’s team did. At 8 in the morning on Saturday, April 16, Trump’s top staff members convened on the fifth floor of Trump Tower. Ten months into the race, the candidate’s headquarters looked more like the dingy redoubt of a     mayoral campaign than the hypercaffeinated situation room of a presidential  . On ordinary days, no more than eight or 10 staffers inhabited the warehouselike floor, which in the manner of many campaigns was decorated like a   dorm suite: a model White House topped with pink flamingos,   posters of John Wayne and Ronald Reagan, an oversize plush lion the team had named Lion Ted. A recent description in New York Magazine of its spartan condition offended the building owner, who protested to me, “It’s this beautiful raw space!” He conceded that Hillary Clinton’s campaign offices in Brooklyn might be better appointed  —   “though she never had my location. ” Manafort and Lewandowski had gathered the team to discuss the campaign’s new structure  —   which would now have Manafort overseeing the entire delegate operation and Lewandowski the campaign apparatus  —   and to introduce its new members, including Rick Wiley, the national political director, previously Scott Walker’s campaign manager. The candidate strolled into the conference room. “Wow, this looks like a professional group of people,” he said, smiling, according to two sources who were present. “All right, guys. I need you to go win. And we’re going to make sure you have what you need to win. ” After speaking for less than two minutes, Trump walked out. For the rest of the meeting, much was said by everyone in the room, but nothing was decided, because Manafort and Lewandowski had thoroughly opposing visions of how the campaign should be run. The   strategist believed it was time for Trump to close out the primaries by taking a more scripted, mollifying approach. The campaign manager held to the view that people attended a Trump rally fully expecting the same type of raucous, unpredictable drama they saw at a sporting event. Trump apparently was listening to both men now. But it was not obvious that morning whose view would prevail  —   or even which of the two had the authority to give orders. One attendee told me that he came out with no more clarity than he had before the meeting. When Politico broke the news of the secret meeting two days later, on the evening of April 18, Trump was en route to a campaign rally in Buffalo aboard his smaller Citation X airplane, with Hicks, Lewandowski and Ivanka Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, who was informally advising the campaign. It was the day before the New York primary, and Trump sat in the front of the   plane. “I have to think about my speech now,” he told me, and began composing one on the spot. He leafed through various talking points and issue memos, from which he culled a few ideas that he then scribbled on another piece of paper. Once he was done with the other documents, he tore them in half lengthwise and let the scraps flutter to the floor. The plane touched down at the airport, and the waiting fleet of black sedans whisked the candidate and his entourage to the city’s hockey arena, where the rally would take place. Trump was posing for photographs with campaign volunteers when Hicks’s phone buzzed. It was Paul Manafort, calling to try to head off another   controversy. A woman whom Trump had briefly considered hiring in 2015 to help with communications strategy, Cheri Jacobus, was suing the candidate, his campaign and Lewandowski for libel after Trump tweeted that she had “begged my people for a job,” in addition to a few other disparaging remarks. Trump wanted to punch back  —   it was what he did and in Lewandowski’s view, the candidate’s brawling, politically incorrect impulses were what had made him the   to begin with. At the candidate’s direction, Hicks had prepared a statement chiding Jacobus’s threat. Manafort was now on the phone urging Trump not to release the statement. Attacking Jacobus yet again struck him as unnecessary, not to mention a distraction from the task at hand: winning big in tomorrow’s primary. It also flew in the face of Manafort’s publicly stated vow that his new client would now be evincing a more “presidential” affect. Trump grew more   as he heard Manafort out. Then he said, “Don’t tell me how to [expletive] do P. R. ” He stepped into a private room to fix his hair, then posed for a few more photos with the man who was about to introduce him to the crowd, Rex Ryan, head coach of the Buffalo Bills. That evening, addressing a hockey arena filled with perhaps 17, 000 delirious Trumpophiles, he bellowed: “I don’t want to really act more ‘presidential’ until we win!” The following evening at Trump Tower, the man who stepped out before the press  —   heralded by Sinatra’s “New York, New York”  —   to celebrate his   victory in his home state’s primary appeared uncharacteristically subdued. He referred to his vanquished opponent not as “Lyin’ Ted” but as “Senator Cruz. ” He held his usual grievances in check. After eight minutes, he departed the lectern without taking any questions. Manafort had managed to impose a veneer of Beltway respectability on the campaign. More field organizers were now materializing in states like Pennsylvania, where local volunteers had hitherto been left largely to fend for themselves. Supporters who previously received no direction from the campaign before going on TV to expound on the candidate’s policies  —   “I just make [expletive] up,” Representative Duncan Hunter of California confessed to a Trump senior adviser  —   were now receiving daily talking points. But the       —   where to go, whom to see, what to say and how to say it  —   still rested almost exclusively upon the whims of Trump and, secondarily, with the person in his immediate proximity, who was almost always Lewandowski. That became apparent to me on the morning of April 25, the day before the string of Northeastern primaries that would restore Trump’s indomitability. The candidate was seated in the front of his Citation as it departed the airstrip of Warwick, R. I.  —   a stop that, Manafort and Lewandowski agreed, had been a complete waste of the candidate’s time, given that he was ahead of Cruz there by 40 points. But when Trump told Lewandowski, “I can’t just not go there,” there was little point arguing. Lewandowski began making calls to his advance team on Sunday morning. Some 24 hours later, Trump walked into a sweaty and delirious tented gathering adjacent to a Warwick hotel  —   exulting, with customary hyperbole: “We set this up 12 hours ago! There’s thousands outside  —   we need a bigger tent!” Later that day, en route to West Chester, Pa. Trump’s thoughts kept wandering afield from politics. He sat with a large stack of newspaper clippings  —   some of them with handwritten notes from his daughter Ivanka  —   at his feet. To his right sat his    son Eric, whom I heard Trump refer to as “honey. ” He perused some documents relating to a land deal he was considering, pausing to fret over the fate of his friend Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback whose   suspension for his role in the Deflategate scandal was upheld that morning by a federal appeals court: “He should’ve sued the N. F. L. in Boston at the very beginning. ” He asked Lewandowski whether his campaign schedule would allow him to attend the June 25 grand opening of his Turnberry golf resort on the coast of Scotland. “If we get to 1, 237, you’re there,” Lewandowski said. “If we’re at 1, 100, you’re going nowhere. ” Trump scowled a bit but did not protest. I was reminded that Trump was still fundamentally a real estate developer with exactly zero previous campaign experience, who had gotten this far by spending only a fraction of what his opponents had and against the wishes of his party  —   who was as new to the idea of a Trump candidacy as the rest of us were. Although his political maturation over the past year had not been altogether linear, it seemed clear that an understanding of what his candidacy meant to his supporters was taking root. Trump seemed aware, despite his insistence that voters of all stripes were drawn to him, that his constituency came chiefly from white   Americans who felt left out of the Obama recovery and cheated by what they saw as a rigged economic system. Playing to this sentiment, he had begun to include in his speeches a litany of dire economic statistics pertaining to whichever state he happened to be visiting at the time. The data, compiled by Sam Clovis and Stephen Miller, senior policy advisers, invariably cited the collapse of that local manufacturing sector over the past two decades. It had become axiomatic in Trump World that wherever jobs had been lost was also where Trump’s voters could be found. “They’re great people,” he murmured back on the plane after the event in Buffalo. “And they want help. ” His face crinkled in disgust. “They don’t want hope. They want help. ” It was a sobering reminder of the expectations that a President Trump might find on his shoulders come January. But the moment passed, and his mood seemed to regain altitude, the desperate souls on the rope line reaggregating into an adoring mass of     yugeness. “So you’ve covered other people  —   nobody comes close to this,” he said. “Two guys from Fox said they’ve never seen anything like it. ” We rose upward through the skies in the vehicle Trump referred to as “just about the fastest plane made,” eventually passing over the Ferry Point golf course that Trump said he had built faster than anyone else could, and finally toward the great Manhattan skyline that Trump had made even greater  —   a taste of what he could do for America, if its great people would only let him.</td>\n",

All times eastern.  —   10:17:  Weld answers “Monkey Business” when asked what he would title a novel based on the 2016 election. 10:11: The candidates get a question about the libertarian movement supports the “Black Lives Matter”movement. Weld, sounding like a Boston Brahmin, says he is a pluralist and his wife read from the Quran to various groups that make up the diaspora. Speaks about various “diversity” initiatives he instituted as governor. Johnson says we’d like to bring an end to the drug war. Both candidates seem out of touch with the questioner. 9:55: Johnson says he’s tired of the   system and it wouldn’t bother him if he hurt either Trump or Clinton in the general election. On taxes, he says he if he could waive a magic want, he would eliminate the income tax and corporate tax and abolish the IRS. He would then institute a consumption tax. He says 80% of the lobbyists would go away if these taxes were eliminated. 9:45: Johnson talks about various grades of heroin and says marijuana should be legal but heroin should  not. A woman whose son is in a wheelchair and was permanently disabled due to a heroin overdose has been challenging Johnson on his past statement re: legalizing all drugs. Johnson says that prohibition does more harm than good. 9:35: When Johnson asks whom he would pick if he had to choose between Trump and Clinton, he says he knows there will “always be a libertarian choice” on the ballot and punts. When pressed, Johnson says he’s not going to give in to voting for one or the other. Weld definitely answers “Mrs. Clinton” and insists that Clinton is well qualified to be president while Trump is not. 9:33: Johnson says Trump’s desire to build a fence and deport illegal immigrants is “incendiary. ” He says wanting a border wall is “insane. ” Johnson says illegal immigrants “aren’t taking jobs that U. S. citizens want. ” Weld now takes the opportunity to slam Trump’s foreign policy. Weld invokes Anne Frank in doubling down on his previous comments where he compared Trump’s immigration policy to Nazi Germany. Johnson wants to make it as easy as possible for people to get work visas so the line keeps moving. 9:32: Johnson says he doesn’t go to church, and he says the God that he speaks to doesn’t have a particular religion. 9:30: Questioner asks what the federal government’s role to ensure a woman’s right to choose in every state. Johnson says the law of the land is the woman has a right to have an abortion up to the viability of the fetus. He says we’re not looking to change the law of the land in any way. Johnson says Planned Parenthood “does a lot of good” and Republicans alienate voters when they talk about defunding it. 9:25: Debate now turns to health care. Johnson says there should be some “safety net” in the states and says he hasn’t seen a doctor in three years. He says he favors a   approach to health care. He says we would have insurance for catastrophic situations and not ongoing medicare care. Johnson says we have no idea what it’s going to cost to go to doctor and what the outcome will be. He says there will be “dramatic savings” if there is a   approach to healthcare. 9:19: Johnson says you shouldn’t close off the debate on more gun control. He says that “automatic weapons” have been illegal in the United States. Weld says ISIS should be treated like a “gigantic organized crime family. ” Johnson says the   lists are subject to error and doesn’t agree with the   that is taking place right now in the House. Cuomo, taking the liberal line on gun control, tries to make the case that there is “due process” for people on   list. Johnson keeps pointing out that the lists are subject to error that can impact people’s lives. 9:12: And there you have it. LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATES PRAISE CLINTON, SLAM TRUMP  ON CNN. 9:10: Johnson says Obama is a “good guy. ” Weld says Obama has been a “ ” president. When asked about Hillary Clinton, Johnson says Clinton is a “wonderful public servant. ” Weld says he has had a “lifelong bond” with Clinton. When asked about Trump, Johnson says he’s sure there’s something good one could say about Trump. He says had he been in the GOP debates, he would have said that he would not support Trump. Weld calls Trump a “huckster. ” 9:02: When asked to introduce himself, Johnson notes he is an athlete and a former governor.  He says a “libertarian” is fiscally conservative, socially accepting and  . He points out that being a   does not mean one is an isolationist. Weld says they want government out of people’s pocketbooks and bedrooms. [Interesting that CNN would devote an hour to the libertarian ticket. Green Party candidate Jill Stein got 7% compared to Johnson’s 9% in CNN’s latest national poll.  But giving the Green Party an hour on television may take away votes from Clinton.] 9:00: CNN is hosting a libertarian town hall with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. 6:50: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox Tweets “Never Trump. ” The “Never Trump” movement is doing as badly as Mexico’s soccer team did against Chile.

He says he has been told by a number of his colleagues that he gave a “very good speech. ” When pressed on Trump’s opposition to the TPP, Ryan says the TPP still has “promise” and hopes the agreement can be changed into a “ ” agreement.  CNN’s Blitzer, now putting on the Dem. uniform since it’s the general election, doing his best to use Ryan as the useful tool to make Trump seem “extreme” asks Ryan if he “totally disagrees” with Trump on building a wall, deporting illegal immigrants, and instituting a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants. Ryan says he has “no plans” to host fundraisers for Trump’s presidential campaign. Ryan, while undermining Trump’s general election chances, says Clinton can’t be elected because Republicans will lose the Supreme Court for a generation. Ryan talks about his “Better Way” agenda, not realizing that almost everyone outside of the Beltway has no idea what’s in it. Ryan says “it depends on the issue” when asked if he trust Trump. 6:08: The ambitious career politician needs a title to plan another run for president: 9 times Senate candidate Marco Rubio told us he didn’t like the Senate https:  .  via @GregJKrieg pic. twitter.   —   CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) June 22, 2016,  6:03:   fundraising getting better: #BREAKING Since Tuesday morning the @realDonaldTrump campaign and the JFC have raised over 5 million online,  —   Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) June 22, 2016,  5:59: Media can’t wait to “fact check” every utterance Trump makes.

CNN’s Manu Raju does a great job pushing Rubio on his Gang of Eight bill, his missed votes in the Senate. He calls him out when Rubio says if he was intending to run in 2020, which means he is assuming the GOP will lose in 2016 (?) he would not be running for reelection. Rubio, though, doesn’t rule out a   bid and sounds like the typical politician who always talks out of both sides of his mouth. Why else would Rubio be running?  He needs a “title” for a future presidential run. Stop insulting the intelligence of regular people with these answers crafted by Beltway consultants. That’s why Rubio never caught on in the primary campaign where voters wanted an outsider. 3:20: Makes you wonder if Sanders really initially entered the race with the intention of winning it: The reason she hasn’t had to defend the foundation, by the way?

She supports apprenticeship programs where people can “earn” while they “learn. ” After railing against “wage theft,” Clinton says she supports an “exit tax” on corporations that try to move overseas. 2:50: Clinton mentions that black unemployment is twice as high as it was in the 1990s, but she doesn’t mention her support for amnesty legislation and the possible impact that may have or that it went up during Obama’s presidency. Clinton says she doesn’t support the   Partnership, but she says it without much enthusiasm. 2:45: Clinton is making the Dem. argument that comprehensive amnesty legislation will be “smart” for our economy. Trump made the argument that Clinton can’t argue that she’s a friend of minority communities and working Americans when she is advocating for policies that will bring in massive numbers of workers who will take their jobs or lower their wages. Clinton shifts to “breaking the down the barriers” of “systemic racism” that are holding people back from fully participating in our economy. 2:40: Clinton now talks about five ambitious goals the federal government should adopt after saying economic benefits should be more “fairly distributed. ” She speaks about making “college debt free for all. ” She is now talking about the need for investments at home, something Trump has spoken about since the beginning when he has discussed America’s   airports and roads. Clinton wants to “build better” and connect every household to broadband by 2020. She wants a “cleaner and more resilient” power grid. She then advocates raising the national minimum wage. 2:38: While Trump made specific attacks against Clinton, Clinton is attacking corporations and making the same Dem. arguments against generic Republicans. That may work against generic, robotic candidates like Paul Ryan, but it is not likely to stick to Trump. 2:30: Clinton says it’s not an understatement to say Americans face a choice in November. She robotically slams Trump for spewing “reckless ideas. ” Clinton says she’s here to offer an “alternative. ” She says we need to make sure our economy works for everyone [Trump has a compelling case, though, that her immigration policies and past support for globalist trade deals have devastated the economy. ]. Clinton now talking about her     plan for growth. 2:28: Clinton says she has “double the grandmother clothes” and she says you don’t have to be a granddaughter of a Secretary of State to have every opportunity available in the country (sounding a bit like John Edwards in North Carolina). 2:25: In North Carolina, Clinton ready to respond to Trump: Clinton takes the stage in Raleigh, North Carolina. pic. twitter.   —   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) June 22, 2016,  1:55: Clinton will reportedly respond to Trump’s speech in North Carolina: Clinton will use part of her speech in North Carolina today to respond to Trump’s NY speech, per an aide.  —   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) June 22, 2016,  1:15: Palin to join Trump in Colorado: Sarah Palin to join Trump at Denver’s Western Conservative Summit https:  .  via @denverpost @joeybunch #copolitics,  —   Chuck Plunkett (@chuckplunkett) June 22, 2016,  1:13: Ted Cruz allies still scheming: . @TedCruz allies in Georgia are pressuring delegates there to vote against Trump at the convention: https:  .   —   Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) June 22, 2016,  12:50: Washington Post wasn’t credentialed for today’s Trump speech: Washington Post was not credentialed for Trump’s speech today.

He goes out of his way to say some of Trump’s statements “about women and minorities” are “not just offensive but unacceptable. ” The prospect of a Trump presidency is also worrisome to me. It is no secret that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump. His positions on many key issues are still unknown. And some of his statements, especially about women and minorities, I find not just offensive but unacceptable. If he is elected, we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him. I’ve proven a willingness to do both. Tony Lee: Trump needed to give this speech in front of a packed crowd in a city that has been devastated by bad trade deals. Second, Trump took a step forward but needs to keep improving as a candidate. Today, he often sounded like a Congressman at a hearing reading something that was written for him by career staffers. It didn’t feel like he viscerally owned the speech and its themes, which is something he needs to get down before the general public starts paying attention to the general election in a month. Third, Trump’s speeches never have a thread that binds everything together. Trump needs to show some vulnerability and talk about how he was underestimated and dismissed when he tried to get into New York’s real estate market from Brooklyn. He needs to then talk about some of his setbacks and then argue that   can roar back like he did. 11:37: The elite media tip their hand re: what may resonate with voters by their apoplectic reactions. David Gergen on CNN says Trump’s use of Clinton Cash to attack Clinton was “slanderous. ” That overreaction tells you that Gergen knows those attacks may well stick in the general election. 11:35: CNN’s Margaret Hoover, one of the network’s establishment GOP pundits, shows how clueless she is when he says Paul Ryan may have hijacked Trump’s Teleprompter when speaking about Trump’s comments to revitalize the inner cities. There’s a huge difference. Trump is vowing to end amnesty and curb illegal immigration in order to help those in the inner cities get better jobs. He is vowing to make better trade deals to bring jobs back to the inner cities. He said he wants to use the funds dedicated to admitting more Syrian refugees to revitalize the inner cities. Paul Ryan’s “better way” plan for the inner cities is just a bunch of gobblyedgook from a person who has spent his whole life in the politics and still speaks like a career staffer adept at giving power point presentation. 11:28: Trump also vows to support our police and law enforcement because we can’t ever forget the “great job they do. ” He also promises to appoint “great Supreme Court Justices. ” Trump says parents will start dreaming big for their children again, including parents in our inner cities, when he becomes president. He says Americans are going to start believing in the future of our country and vows to make America “rich” and “safe” again. 11:25: Trump talks about bringing America back. He says massive factories will come back. Inner cities will be rebuilt. He says construction is what he knows and wages will be going up along with “new jobs, jobs, jobs. ” Trump says Clinton’s   policies will drive down wages and get rid of even more jobs. 11:20: Clinton can’t say she cares about   and Hispanics when she wants to bring in millions of workers to compete against them for jobs. Trump says he will change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans opportunities to get good jobs. He vows to stand up to countries that cheat us on trade. Trump also discusses tough ethics rules for the office of the Secretary of State. He says the one common theme in all of his reforms: “It will be America First. ” Trump says Clinton’s message is “old and tired. ” He says Clinton’s message is that “things can’t change” while his message is things have to change and this may be the only chance to do so. Trump says we need “real change” and “not Obama change. ” 11:18: Trump reads a letter from a mother whose child was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Trump says Mrs. Mendoza wrote that “Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms way. An   policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I. ” Mendoza believes Clinton needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes against our country. Trump adds that we could rebuild every inner city in America with the amount of money she intends to spend on admitting Muslim refugees. 11:17: Trump says immigration policy “national security is also immigration security and Hillary wants neither. ” Trump says Clinton has put forward the “most radical” immigration platform in the history of the United States. He says Clinton wants massive amnesty and complete “open borders” due to lack of enforcement of immigration laws. He says the first victims of her radical policies will be poor   and Hispanic workers who need jobs. 11:15: Trump says America’s enemies probably have a “blackmail file” on Clinton, and that is why we can’t elect her to be president. Trump says her “deepest, darkest secrets” are probably in the hands of our enemies because her private server was probably hacked. 11:12: Trump, again citing Clinton Cash, points out that Clinton gave approval to transferring 20% of our Uranium to Russia for $125 million in donations to her Clinton Foundation. Trump also points out that Clinton took millions from countries that oppress women and gays and suggests she set up a private server to conceal her private dealings. 11:09: Trump: Clinton refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by radical Islam. He slams her for wanting a 500% increase in Syrian refugees while hundreds of immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorism. Trump says he only wants to admit people who “share our values and love our people. ” Trump says Clinton wants to bring in people who want women enslaved and gays put to death. He says Clinton “may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States. ” 11:06: Trump: Clinton has opened the “Pandora’s Box of radical Islam. ” Trump says ISIS threatens us because of the decisions Clinton has made along with President Obama. He says ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the world. Trump says Clinton’s bad judgment started with her decision to support the Iraq War and learned nothing from Iraq. Trump says Clinton “rushed us into war in Libya. ” He says Clinton lacks the “judgment” and “temperament” to lead the country and should not be president “under any circumstances. ” 11:03: Trump says Clinton’s foreign policy has “unleashed ISIS across the world. ” Trump says Ambassador Stevens was left to die while Clinton was sleeping. Trump then blasts Clinton for lying about Benghazi. Trump says “it was a different world” before Clinton was sworn in and then “in four years, Sec. Clinton almost singlehandedly destabilized the entire Middle East. ” Trump says thanks to Clinton, Iran is now the dominant power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons. 10:59: Trump says Clinton’s performance as Secretary of State was “disgraceful. ” He also says China has taken billions and billions of dollars of our intellectual property while Clinton gave China our best jobs. Trump mentions Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweitzer’s Clinton Cash book and says Clinton gets rich while making you poor. Trump says Clinton “sold out” our country to Beijing and points out that Clinton has been one of the top proponents of the   Partnership. Trump says that Clinton is pretending to be against the deal and mention that she deleted a section from her book where she effusively supports the deal. Trump says that the government could find Clinton’s emails if it really wanted to. Trump says if Clinton is elected, she will adopt the   Partnership and we will lose our “economic independence for good. ” He says TPP will be worse than NAFTA. Trump says he wants trade deals that are great for the country and workers. 10:57: Trump says “we have to make America rich again. ” Trump says our country will be great again when we start making its own products again and bring back its manufacturing base. Trump points out that one of the major bills that George Washington signed dealt with the encouragement and protection of manufacturing jobs. Trump also quotes Lincoln re: protecting the country’s manufacturing base. [Why is Trump not giving this address in one of the areas impacted by NAFTA?] 10:56: Trump says Clinton thinks she’s “entitled” to the office. Trump says his response to Clinton’s “I’m with her” campaign slogan is “I’m with you, the American people. ” Trump says Clinton thinks “it’s all about her. ” Trump says the country lost its way when it stopped putting the American people first. Trump says we’ve got here because we went from “Americanism” to “globalism” all to the detriment to the American worker and the American economy. “This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats,” Trump says. “This is a wave of globalism that wipes out our middle class and our jobs along with it. ” 10:55: Trump says the special interests “own” clinton. Trump says Clinton doesn’t have the “temperament” or the “judgment” to be president. 10:53: Trump says this election will decide whether we’re ruled by the people or the politicians. Trump promises to end the special interest monopoly in D. C. Trump says Clinton has “perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft. ” He says Clinton ran the State Department like a “personal hedge fund” while doing favors for oppressive regimes in exchange for cash. 10:52: Trump, now defending his businesses, says he started off in Brooklyn with a “small” loan and now has an empire worth $10 billion. Trump says he is running for president to end the unfairness and put the American worker first. “We’re going to put America First, and we’re going to make America great again,” Trump says. 10:50: Trump calls Clinton a “world class liar. ” Trump attacks Clinton for her “phony landing in Bosnia. ” He says Brian Williams’s career was destroyed for saying much less. 10:48: Trump says we can’t fix a rigged system by counting on the same insiders who rigged it in the first place. Trump asks Sanders’s supporters to join his movement so “we can fix the system” together. “This includes fixing all of our disastrous trade deals,” Trump says. Trump says the “whole economy” is rigged in addition to the political system. 10:45: In New York (why is he not in a swing state like Ohio or at least Florida?) Trump says he is running for president to give back to the country that has been “so very good to me. ” Trump says only he can fix the country’s problems like its crumbling infrastructure and bad trade policies.   10:15: Clinton in D.

When another protester interrupts Trump’s rally, he says “we want to love our protesters. ” Then he promptly says, “get ’em out of here. ” He calls the protester a “disgusting guy” for putting on a KKK hat. 6:26: Trump says protesters are sent in by “Bernie” and “Hillary. ” Trump says as soon as the police started arresting the protesters who were blocking the road to his earlier rally, they all dispersed. 6:25: Trump rally interrupted by protester. “We love our protesters, don’t we?” Trump says. 6:22: Trump reportedly meeting with Congressional Republicans ahead of AIPAC speech. 6:15: Arpaio says “we locked up some demonstrators and threw them in jail. ” Arpaio says he wants to “pay a visit” to agitators outside who are trying to disrupt the event.

Ask yourselves this: Are they good at combating   media on their turf? Nope. Democrats like Axelrod, Begala wipe the floor with these people. Are they good at appealing to young voters, urban voters, minorities? Do these people look like folks regular Americans would want to hang out with? Nope. None of these voters will take them seriously —  just like they won’t take “Reformicons” or Eric Cantor or Paul Ryan seriously. Are they good at understanding the concerns of the GOP base? Nope —  or they would have seen that Trump —  and his message —  would resonate a long time ago. So what are these hacks good for except being professional   tacticians? Notice the politicians that drive them the craziest are the ones —  like Dr. Ben Carson, Palin, Trump —  who don’t need them to be middlemen to get their message out to the people. These people are insecure to begin with and realizing that they aren’t even relevant anymore in politics just makes them angry. None of these people seem like they are content with their lives, so it must be even more upsetting to realize they no longer matter in the one industry in which they though they were relevant and in the “in crowd” of dweebs.] 5:49:   folks in the conservative industrial complex floating Rick Perry, one of the faces of the conservative industrial   as a possible   candidate.

A few fresh faced young girls arrived, humorous signs in tow  —   ambling around looking for their supporters and friends. In the meantime, there were a handful of   people arguing with passers by. Police outnumbered protesters by noon by around 20 to 1. As time drew on, scores of people entered the circle, eventually taking over just one small segment of it, waving their banners and selling their badges labelled “DUMP TRUMP” and “SAY NOT TO CAPITALISM”. While there were clearly many Bernie Sanders fans in attendance, the vast majority of those in attendance seemed to be   AND  . This is a hard line, revolutionary socialist protest. Chants included “refugees are welcome here”  —   exactly the same slogans you heard on London’s streets today, as the same type of left wing activists engaged in running battles with nationalist counter protesters on Oxford Street. Curiously, much of the protest in New York this afternoon revolved around a soccer team, with many of the organisers wearing “New York Cosmos” apparel and waving “AntiFa” ( ) banners. The early crowds were very clearly mostly people of Latin American backgrounds, chanting in Spanish, a bunches of young women wearing hijabs. Then came the revolutionary socialists. One woman told me she would abolish the presidency and have the United States run as a Soviet,   country. Others dressed up as death, the Statue of Liberty, and waved signs insisting that everyone was an immigrant once. “Fuck Trump,” was a common catchphrase, as various speakers lined up with a small megaphone to shout in the direction of the crowd. Consensus appears to be that there were around 350 people on Columbus Circle  —   a busted flush when you consider the event had over 5, 000 confirmed attendees on its Facebook page. Journalists looked equally confused and disappointed, as did the rally goers whispering to each other: “We thought there would be more. How come there’s not more?” At the time of writing the protest is still on Columbus circle, and due to move down Central Park South towards the Trump Tower.  1:45: “Brandon’s life matters,” she says. She also said that Trump has been a voice for “all of us who have had a loved one killed by an illegal. ” She says no politician has “ever stood up for us. ” She also said, “isn’t it time that out government gave a damn about Americans?” She says there are plenty of   programs for illegal immigrants but none for victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. #Trump Brandon Mendozas mom telling story of her son a Mesa police offer killed by illegal. #fox10phoenix,  —   John Hook (@JohnHookfox10) March 19, 2016,  #Trump in fountain hills.

       "        <td>ATLANTIC CITY  —   The Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel is now closed, its windows clouded over by sea salt. Only a faint outline of the gold letters spelling out      remains visible on the exterior of what was once this city’s premier casino. Not far away, the   Trump Marina Hotel Casino was sold at a major loss five years ago and is now known as the Golden Nugget. At the nearly deserted eastern end of the boardwalk, the Trump Taj Mahal, now under new ownership, is all that remains of the casino empire Donald J. Trump assembled here more than a   ago. Years of neglect show: The carpets are frayed and   chandeliers dangle above the few customers there to play the penny slot machines. On the presidential campaign trail, Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, often boasts of his success in Atlantic City, of how he outwitted the Wall Street firms that financed his casinos and rode the value of his name to riches. A central argument of his candidacy is that he would bring the same business prowess to the Oval Office, doing for America what he did for his companies. “Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me,” Mr. Trump said in an interview in May, summing up his   history here. “The money I took out of there was incredible. ” His audacious personality and opulent properties brought attention  —   and countless players  —   to Atlantic City as it sought to overtake Las Vegas as the country’s gambling capital. But a close examination of regulatory reviews, court records and security filings by The New York Times leaves little doubt that Mr. Trump’s casino business was a protracted failure. Though he now says his casinos were overtaken by the same tidal wave that eventually slammed this seaside city’s gambling industry, in reality he was failing in Atlantic City long before Atlantic City itself was failing. But even as his companies did poorly, Mr. Trump did well. He put up little of his own money, shifted personal debts to the casinos and collected millions of dollars in salary, bonuses and other payments. The burden of his failures fell on investors and others who had bet on his business acumen. In three interviews with The Times since late April, Mr. Trump acknowledged in general terms that high debt and lagging revenues had plagued his casinos. He did not recall details about some issues, but did not question The Times’s findings. He repeatedly emphasized that what really mattered about his time in Atlantic City was that he had made a lot of money there. Mr. Trump assembled his casino empire by borrowing money at such high interest rates  —   after telling regulators he would not  —   that the businesses had almost no chance to succeed. His casino companies made four trips to bankruptcy court, each time persuading bondholders to accept less money rather than be wiped out. But the companies repeatedly added more expensive debt and returned to the court for protection from lenders. After narrowly escaping financial ruin in the early 1990s by delaying payments on his debts, Mr. Trump avoided a second potential crisis by taking his casinos public and shifting the risk to stockholders. And he never was able to draw in enough gamblers to support all of the borrowing. During a decade when other casinos here thrived, Mr. Trump’s lagged, posting huge losses year after year. Stock and bondholders lost more than $1. 5 billion. All the while, Mr. Trump received copious amounts for himself, with the help of a compliant board. In one instance, The Times found, Mr. Trump pulled more than $1 million from his failing public company, describing the transaction in securities filings in ways that may have been illegal, according to legal experts. Mr. Trump now says that he left Atlantic City at the perfect time. The record, however, shows that he struggled to hang on to his casinos years after the city had peaked, and failed only because his investors no longer wanted him in a management role. There are those here who fondly remember Mr. Trump’s showmanship, the thousands he employed in a struggling city, and the tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue his casinos generated. “He was a great person for the company,” said Scott C. Butera, the president of Mr. Trump’s company at the time of its 2004 bankruptcy. “With his oversight, his brand and marketing, he’s really adept. ” Many others were glad to see him go. “He put a number of local contractors and suppliers out of business when he didn’t pay them,” said Steven P. Perskie, who was New Jersey’s top casino regulator in the early 1990s. “So when he left Atlantic City, it wasn’t, ‘Sorry to see you go.’ It was, ‘How fast can you get the hell out of here? ’” Donald Trump darted beneath the 70   minarets and nine carved elephants that lined the roof, through the lobby and across the casino floor, seemingly oblivious to the spectators’ cries of “Donald, Donald,” and the gamblers clutching bricks of $100 bills at the blackjack tables. It was April 1990, and Mr. Trump was officially opening his third gambling resort in Atlantic City, the biggest project of his career: the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal. “It’s truly going to be an incredible place,” he told reporters. “We’re calling it the eighth wonder of the world. ” The Taj was certainly of outsize proportions: Its   tower was New Jersey’s tallest building, and the casino was the world’s largest. In a remarkably short time, Mr. Trump had become a commanding figure in Atlantic City, with his casinos accounting for nearly a third of its gambling revenues and employing more than 8, 000 people. Trump Plaza came first. In the early 1980s, Mr. Trump gained control of a prime spot on the boardwalk. Unable to get financing to build a casino, he forged a partnership with Harrah’s Entertainment, a national gambling operator. Harrah’s agreed to provide Mr. Trump, who did not put any additional money into the deal, with $220 million in financing to build the project, to pay him a $24 million construction management fee and to give him half the profits. The   Harrah’s at Trump Plaza opened in 1984. From the start, the partners were at odds over its marketing and whose name should be paramount. “It wasn’t a   partnership,” said Philip G. Satre, the retired chairman of Harrah’s. “We were a big company with an institutional approach to running a business, and he was a real estate entrepreneur who kind of shot from the hip. ” Then Mr. Trump bought Hilton’s nearly completed casino in the marina district for $320 million, calling it Trump Castle. His company issued $352 million in bonds to finish construction and open the casino, and tacked on an additional $32 million. That casino opened in 1985 and competed directly against his partner’s first casino, Harrah’s Marina. The following year, Harrah’s scuttled its partnership with Mr. Trump and sold him its stake in Trump Plaza for more than $220 million. Next Mr. Trump went after the biggest casino of all, the Taj Mahal, which Resorts International, builder of Atlantic City’s first casino, was erecting. After buying a controlling interest in Resorts from the estate of its founder, Mr. Trump battled the talk show host Merv Griffin for control of the company. In the end, Mr. Griffin got the company, while Mr. Trump won the   Taj Mahal. Even before the Taj opened, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission was concerned about the casino’s viability given its rapidly escalating costs and considered revoking its operating license. Regulators closely monitored the financial performance of the Trump casinos and the developer’s empire. Mr. Trump told the commission in 1988 that he could rein in expenses, because conventional lenders were lining up to give him money at low interest rates. He said he abhorred junk bonds, which were then popular, because they carried a bigger risk of default and thus came with higher interest rates. Within months, he reversed course, issuing $675 million worth of junk bonds, with a 14 percent interest rate, to finish construction and get the Taj open. In recent interviews, Mr. Trump has said that with each financing he routinely took money out of the casinos to invest in Manhattan real estate. Total debt on the Taj exceeded $820 million. Less than two weeks before the casino opened, Marvin B. Roffman, a casino analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, an investment firm based in Philadelphia, told The Wall Street Journal that the Taj would need to reap $1. 3 million a day just to make its interest payments, a sum no casino had ever achieved. “The market just isn’t there,” Mr. Roffman told The Journal. Mr. Trump retaliated, demanding that Janney Montgomery Scott fire Mr. Roffman. It did. “It was doomed way before the start,” said W. Bucky Howard, who was promoted by Mr. Trump to president of the Taj five days after it opened, in a recent interview. “I told him it was going to fail. The Taj was underfunded. ” Almost immediately, Mr. Trump had trouble making the debt payments on the Taj and his other casinos. It was also clear that the Taj was cannibalizing the Castle and the Plaza, whose combined gambling revenues dropped by $58 million the year it opened. After more than tripling as new casinos opened through the 1980s, gambling revenues in Atlantic City flattened in 1990, rising by just 1. 35 percent, as gamblers grew more cautious in light of a national recession. All were hurt, recalled Mr. Perskie, the casino regulator, but none were in the catastrophic financial shape of Mr. Trump’s. At the same time, Mr. Trump’s real estate empire in Manhattan, where the recession cut property values, was also failing. In an August 1990 report, New Jersey regulators noted the “sheer volume of debt” on Mr. Trump’s holdings: $3. 4 billion, including $1. 3 billion on the casinos and $832. 5 million in loans personally guaranteed by Mr. Trump. Regulators warned then that “the possibility of a complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization was not out of the question. ” The Taj Mahal missed its November debt payment. The Castle was also late. By December 1990, when Mr. Trump needed to make an $18. 4 million interest payment, his father, Fred C. Trump, sent a lawyer to the Castle to buy $3. 3 million in chips, to provide him with an infusion of cash. The younger Mr. Trump made the payment, but the Casino Control Commission fined the Castle $65, 000 for what had amounted to an illegal loan. As all of his ventures neared collapse, Mr. Trump’s lenders insisted that he submit a business plan, appoint a chief financial officer for the Trump Organization and sell, among other things, the Trump Shuttle airline, his yacht and his stake in New York City’s Plaza Hotel, which also filed for bankruptcy protection. They also put him on a $   budget for personal and household expenses. Just over a year after it opened, the Taj Mahal was in bankruptcy court, followed in 1992 by both the Plaza and the Castle. In the plan that was worked out, Mr. Trump ceded to the lenders a 50 percent stake in the businesses in return for lower interest rates. The lenders agreed to defer certain principal and interest payments and hold off on personal claims against Mr. Trump for five years. But there was little or no reduction in the enormous debts that would plague his gambling empire far into the future. Mr. Trump now says he looks back on the period as his golden era in the casino business. “Early on, I took a lot of money out of the casinos with the financings and the things we do,” he said in a recent interview. “Atlantic City was a very good cash cow for me for a long time. ” Others were hurt. “He helped expand Atlantic City, but he just did not put the equity into the projects he should have to keep them solvent,” said H. Steven Norton, a casino consultant and a former casino executive at Resorts International. “When he went bankrupt, he not only cost bondholders money, but he hurt a lot of small businesses that helped him construct the Taj Mahal. ” Beth Rosser of West Chester, Pa. is still bitter over what happened to her father, whose company Triad Building Specialties nearly collapsed when Mr. Trump took the Taj into bankruptcy. It took three years to recover any money owed for his work on the casino, she said, and her father received only 30 cents on the dollar. “Trump crawled his way to the top on the back of little guys, one of them being my father,” said Ms. Rosser, who runs Triad today. “He had no regard for thousands of men and women who worked on those projects. He says he’ll make America great again, but his past shows the complete opposite of that. ”  Donald Trump has said that his brushes with financial disaster in the early 1990s reminded him of a lesson his father had taught him: Do not leave yourself on the hook for loans. “My father knew, like I knew, you don’t personally guarantee,” Mr. Trump is quoted saying in “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,” by Timothy L. O’Brien, a former reporter for The Times. “I’ve told people I didn’t follow my own advice. ” His agreements with lenders and the two casino bankruptcies in those years still left Mr. Trump personally responsible for more than $100 million in debt, and his agreements had only delayed the day of reckoning to June 30, 1995. He dealt with that danger by first shifting much of his personal debt onto his casinos, then onto a new group: shareholders. Step 1 came in 1993, when his company sold more junk bonds, adding another $100 million in debt to the Trump Plaza casino. More than half of the new money went to pay off Mr. Trump’s unrelated personal loans. Then, in June 1995, with the risk of being forced into bankruptcy just weeks away, Mr. Trump shifted ownership of the Plaza casino to a new, publicly traded company: Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts. In the initial public offering, 10 million shares were sold at $14. At the same time, the company also sold another $155 million in junk bonds, at a 15. 5 percent interest rate. Becoming a public company burdened Mr. Trump with the responsibility of putting shareholders’ interests first. But Mr. Trump, the largest shareholder and chairman of the board, could generally meet that obligation by obtaining approval from his board of directors and disclosing financial details in securities filings. The board’s three outside members were widely seen as bowing to his wishes. A week after the initial public offering, the new company began using some of the almost $300 million it had raised to clear Mr. Trump’s personal debts. During his financial pinch two years earlier, Chemical Bank had forced Mr. Trump to give up his ownership of the Trump Regency, a hotel next to the Trump Plaza. He held an option to buy it back for $60 million, which included debt on the hotel and $35. 9 million that he personally owed the bank from his purchase of a Manhattan property. The new company exercised that option, in effect transferring Mr. Trump’s debt to its own balance sheet. In 1996, the public company issued more stock and sold $1. 1 billion in junk bonds. The money was used in part to pay off $330 million in bonds on the Plaza that had been guaranteed by a company Mr. Trump controlled, as well as almost $30 million that Mr. Trump personally owed to two banks. The company also bought the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Castle  —   soon renamed the Trump Marina  —   shifting more of Mr. Trump’s debt to shareholders. Mr. Trump celebrated his 50th birthday that June at the Taj Mahal, with the Beach Boys onstage. A flurry of news articles said he was “back” some even quoted Mr. Roffman, the analyst whom Mr. Trump had gotten fired, giving Mr. Trump credit for turning things around. (Mr. Roffman had won a $750, 000 arbitration award from Janney Montgomery for his dismissal and settled a lawsuit against Mr. Trump for an undisclosed sum.) But some analysts  —   and the stock market  —   saw the $525 million that the public company had paid for the Castle as too much. The stock began a long slide, falling from about $35 a share before the sale, to $12 months later. Shareholders sued, alleging that the Castle’s purchase price, which included roughly $175 million in cash to Mr. Trump’s private holding company, had been a “gross and unjustified” sweetheart deal for Mr. Trump. (He later settled the suit.) Another crucial deadline came in 1998. Mr. Trump personally owed $13. 5 million to Donaldson, Lufkin  Jenrette, the investment bank that had underwritten the initial public offering in 1995 under the terms of that loan, he was in danger of defaulting, because the stock price of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts had fallen so low. A default would have made him lose control of the company. Instead, the casino company lent him the money to pay back the bankers. A shareholder sued, accusing the board of directors of breaching its fiduciary responsibility. “T. H. C. R. is a casino and entertainment company,” the lawsuit, filed in 1999, said. “It is not in the business of loaning money. The company desperately needed (and needs) cash to shore up its deteriorating financial condition. ” (The suit was dropped in 2000, shortly after Mr. Trump paid the company back.) Indeed, the company posted losses of $66 million in 1996, $42 million in 1997 and $40 million in 1998. Those losses would continue. Still, Mr. Trump made money, receiving $1 million a year for what was essentially a   job. In 1996, he was paid a $5 million bonus. The public company lent him $3 million to cover costs he had incurred while exploring whether to open a casino in Indiana, then forgave the loan when the stock met price targets. The casino company leased office space in Trump Tower in Manhattan, and Mr. Trump’s other businesses were paid to entertain its “  customers. ” It was later alleged in a lawsuit that at least part of the money was paid for   performers, including Celine Dion, Tony Bennett and Billy Joel, who had appeared at    Mr. Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, Fla. In its response, Mr. Trump’s company did not challenge that allegation. Trump casinos reported paying about $300, 000 a year in “pilot costs” to transport high rollers in Mr. Trump’s jet. The company never disclosed in securities filings just how much the jet was used for casino purposes. The public company’s collapse began in 1999. Just three years after spending about $60 million to buy back the former Trump Regency Hotel and pumping in millions for renovations, the company closed it. The company spent another $26 million to demolish the building, taking a $125 million  . In 2000, Mr. Trump fired the chief executive and installed himself in the role, promising he would turn things around. The share price was by then hovering near $3. “Stock price is always a concern,” Mr. Trump told The Associated Press at the time. “I was focused very much on my Manhattan real estate over the last number of years. Now, I’m going to be focused much more in Atlantic City. ” Though he has acknowledged mistakes in piling crippling debt on Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, Donald Trump has steadfastly maintained that his resorts were the   and   casinos in Atlantic City. “The casinos have done very well from a business standpoint,” he told Playboy magazine in 2004. “People agree that they’re well run, they look good and customers love them. ” In reality, the revenue at Mr. Trump’s casinos had consistently lagged behind their competitors’ for a decade before larger forces ravaged the industry. Beginning in 1997, his share of the Atlantic City gambling market began to slip from its peak of 30 percent. Revenues at other Atlantic City casinos rose 18 percent from 1997 through 2002 Mr. Trump’s fell by 1 percent. Competition grew more intense in 2003, when the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa opened. The $1. 1 billion,   resort redefined the concept of an Atlantic City luxury casino. Revenues at Trump casinos dropped another 6 percent in a little more than a year. Had Mr. Trump’s revenues grown at the rate of other Atlantic City casinos, his company could have made its interest payments and possibly registered a profit. But with sagging revenues and high costs, his casinos had too little money for renovations and improvements, which are vital for hotels to attract guests. The public company never logged a profitable year. “There’s something not right when every single one of your projects doesn’t work out,” said Mr. Roffman, the casino analyst. In a recent interview, Mr. Trump attributed his declining market share in those years to the fact that his three casinos were competing with one another, a tacit acknowledgment that he overbuilt. “That was the bad news,” he said. “The good news is that I saved a lot of money in terms of dealing with costs. ” The year the Borgata opened, Mr. Trump was already asking his bondholders to accept less money, in preparation for a third casino bankruptcy. Yet, at the same time, he managed to pull more money out of the company for himself, The Times found. Since taking Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts public, Mr. Trump had been bound by a “contribution agreement” that required him to engage in the gambling businesses only through his own company and banned him from personally owning more than 5 percent of the stock in any other casino company. So when he bought 10 percent of the shares in Riviera Hotel and Casino, a company based in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump was required to grant an option to purchase the shares to his public corporation. However, when Mr. Trump sold the Riviera shares in April 2004, the company, which was entitled to the proceeds, simply canceled the option, without explanation. The company’s description of the sale did not disclose Mr. Trump’s profit or how he had sold the shares. But in its securities filings, Riviera reported that Mr. Trump had sold the shares in a privately negotiated sale for $10 a share, well above the going price. That would have generated a gain of more than $1 million. Asked to review the transaction by The Times, James D. Cox, a professor at Duke University Law School who specializes in corporate and securities law, said such “material omissions of fact” in the filings by the Trump company could have resulted in criminal charges “if it is knowing and willful,” though such charges are rare. “I think the biggest thing is, it understates his compensation,” Mr. Cox said. At the time, the company was also asking its lenders for a break, and headed toward another bankruptcy. “Basically, that sounds like a fraudulent conveyance,” said David Skeel, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. “The company is throwing away money,” Professor Skeel said. “It’s the equivalent of giving big bonuses to your executives right before you file for bankruptcy. ” But lawyers involved in the bankruptcy case said the transaction had apparently gone unnoticed. In a recent interview, Mr. Trump said that he did not recall the transaction or why the board had canceled its option. Months later, in November 2004, the company filed for bankruptcy protection, the third such trip for Trump casinos. This time bondholders took a $500 million loss. Mr. Trump, who stepped down as chief executive but remained chairman of the board, agreed to invest $55 million of his own money in the company, perhaps his first cash investment. He still received $2 million a year under a “services agreement,” which included the use of his name. Shares sometimes traded below a dollar, but Mr. Trump said the problems had been fixed. “For the first time ever, this will be a deleveraged company,” Mr. Trump told The Las Vegas Sun in 2005. Not everyone agreed. Mr. Trump’s longtime investment bankers at Donaldson, Lufkin  Jenrette had backed out of a deal with Mr. Trump to invest in the company shortly before the bankruptcy was filed. Suing for $26 million in fees, the bankers said in court papers that the casinos would be back in bankruptcy court within five years because Mr. Trump’s revenue projections were too rosy and the company was still carrying too much debt. “The Trump name does not connote   amenities and   service in the casino industry,” lawyers for the investment bank said. “Rather,” the Trump name is associated with “the failure to pay one’s debts, a company that has lost money every year, and properties in need of significant deferred maintenance and lagging behind their competitors. ” (The dispute was later settled.) When Donald Trump has been pressed on his casinos’ performance during his presidential campaign, he has repeatedly said he left Atlantic City at the right time. “Atlantic City is a disaster, and I did great in Atlantic City,” he said during a Republican Party debate last September, according to a transcript. “I knew when to get out. My timing was great. And I got a lot of credit for it. ” That would suggest Mr. Trump willingly left sometime around 2006, the year that revenues peaked in Atlantic City and that Pennsylvania allowed its first casino to open, a development that marked the start of a rapid downward spiral in the city. The   was exacerbated by the recession that began in 2008. But in early 2009, as Trump casinos lurched toward bankruptcy for the fourth time, Mr. Trump was still trying to hang on. At loggerheads with board members who had been selected by bondholders after the 2004 bankruptcy, he offered to buy all or a part of the casino company bearing his name. He was rebuffed, and he quit the board soon after. Testifying in bankruptcy court in Camden, N. J. Mr. Trump argued that the company could not use his name, since shortly before filing the bankruptcy it had stopped paying him the $166, 000 a month he received under the services agreement. He testified that his brand was worth $3 billion. He also testified that he was personally negotiating the settlement of a lawsuit in Florida that would yield more than $100 million for the company. And contradicting what he had said after the prior bankruptcy, he testified that the company’s debt load was still too high. “This time, the debt is being cut by a lot, and the company is really poised,” he said. There were odd moments on the stand. Mr. Trump, for example, vastly understated his role, saying he “became very much less involved with the company” during years when he was actually chairman of the board and chief executive, and “was on the board in a very minority position” during years when he had been chairman. As in previous cases, others warned that Mr. Trump’s promises should not be trusted. This time it was Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor who had a major stake in the company. (The two men now describe themselves as friends and Mr. Icahn supports Mr. Trump’s candidacy.) Mr. Icahn’s team argued that the remaining debt was still unsupportable, that the Trump name was replaceable, and that a windfall from the Florida lawsuit was wishful thinking. Under Mr. Trump, the company had a long history of making rosy revenue projections and never meeting them, Mr. Icahn’s lawyer argued. But a judge approved the Trump plan and noted that Mr. Trump and his supporters had established “that the Trump brand is worth millions of dollars” to the casinos. This time, bondholders gave up about $1. 3 billion in exchange for control of the company. For the first time, Mr. Trump had no official role at the company he had founded, and he owned no more than 10 percent. In a recent interview, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he left Atlantic City when he did because he failed in his effort to buy back the casinos. But he said the timing worked out well for him, in the end. “In 2009 they were worth a hell of a lot more than they are now,” he said. “Sometimes you’re better off lucky than good. ” Trump Marina was soon sold for $38 million, less than 10 percent of what the company paid Mr. Trump for it in 1996. The Plaza was shuttered. The Florida lawsuit that Mr. Trump had valued at more than $100 million produced nothing for the company. Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka sued the company, saying their brand was being tarnished by the ramshackle appearance of the Taj Mahal. Mr. Trump continued to earn money from the casinos. In 2011, the casinos reported leasing a Trump helicopter for $390, 000 and spending $236, 000 for “Trump labeled merchandise,” including $197, 000 for Trump Ice bottled water. In retrospect, David Hanlon, a veteran casino executive who ran Merv Griffin’s Atlantic City operations at the time of the Resorts battle, said, Mr. Trump succeeded in repeatedly convincing investors, bankers and Wall Street that “his name had real value. ” “They were so in love with him that they came back a second, third and fourth time,” Mr. Hanlon said. “They let him strip out assets. It was awful to watch. It was astonishing. I have to give Trump credit for using his celebrity time and time again. ” In 2014, the casino company filed for bankruptcy protection for the fifth time. The chief executive cited the debt level after the 2009 bankruptcy as the primary reason. For a time, Mr. Trump lent a glamorous sheen to the faded resort city. But some of his former investors no longer see the value. “People underestimated Donald Trump’s ability to pillage the company,” said Sebastian Pignatello, a private investor who at one time held stock in the Trump casinos worth more than $500, 000. “He drove these companies into bankruptcy by his mismanagement, the debt and his pillaging. ”</td>\n",

He wants America to provide more economic assistance in the Middle East and do more re: water issues and the “devastation in Gaza. ” He wants money to go into the region for schools, infrastructure, healthcare instead of for weapons of mass destruction.

She says “on balance” the Iran Deal was the rights step to take but the “slightest infraction” must have consequences. She says it has to be “distrust but verify. ” On Donald Trump, she says he has been engaging in “bluster” and “bigotry” and there are “serious questions” about his qualifications. He says Trump would qualify as a “bully” for inciting his supporters to “go after” protesters. “Who knows?” Clinton says when Cooper asks if there is a “different Donald Trump” that she knows of. When Cooper asks if the skills used in business are the same ones involved in running government, Clinton says you have much more control over employees in a business than in government. Clinton says “in general” there is a difference and Trump’s behavior raises “questions about what he will do. ” Clinton says potentially moving the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem is something that has to be looked at in a potential   solution. She says she favors using the U. S.’s veto power in the U. N. to protect Israel. She says she was the last person who brought Netanyahu and Abbas together. She says she got more encouragement to pursue a   solution after listening to that meeting along with George Mitchell. Clinton says if Cruz moves the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem on the first day of his presidency, that would end any chance of attaining a   solution. She says it could make things more dangerous for Israel.   8:48: Cruz says his staff and Rubio’s staff have not had any conversations about a   unity ticket. Cruz again states that he will support Trump if he becomes the nominee but insists Trump will not be the nominee. 8:47: Cruz says he will win a contested convention against Trump if Trump can’t secure enough delegates before the convention. 8:45: Cruz says he has “zero interest” in being Trump’s vice president and says Trump may be the only candidate Clinton can beat in a general election. 8:43: Cruz says every time Trump gets scared, he starts lashing out and insulting people. Cruz says Trump’s entire campaign is built on a lie. He says the lie behind Trump’s campaign is that he’ll stand up to Washington. Cruz says Trump has made millions buying influence in Washington while Clinton has made millions selling influence in Washington. [Tony Lee: People aren’t buying this argument because they think Trump knows the system and will fight for the   as fiercely as he gamed the system for himself. Will say it again —  Trump is the athlete people hate but would love to have on their team.] 8:41: Cruz says it was a “remarkable miracle” for Graham to hold a fundraiser for him after recently “calling for my murder. ” He says that is a sign of Republicans uniting around his campaign because it is the only that has repeatedly beaten and can beat Trump. 8:26: Cruz says he listened to some of Trump’s speech and it is clear he hired someone to write the speech for him. Cruz says when Trump says he wants to be “neutral” re:   he is buying into the “moral equivalency” pushed by the media. Cruz says Trump is an interesting character because he can have multiple policy positions in a day. Cruz says in order to have a peace deal, the Palestinians need to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and renounce terrorism, stop paying the families of terrorists. He says   both accept “moral equivalency. ” He says Trump’s knowledge of the world is limited and again dings him for referring to “Palestine. ” Cruz says   won’t move the embassy to Jerusalem. Cruz says moving the embassy to Jerusalem will send a message to our friends and allies. “It makes a statement to every one of our allies that America is back,” Cruz says. He says though Iran will be furious, it makes a statement to the radical Islamic terrorists that America will stand up to them and the era of appeasement under   is over. Cruz defends foreign policy adviser Frank Gaffney, and he praises Gaffney’s work fighting jihadism and potential EMP attacks. When Blitzer keeps pushing him on Gaffney’s past quotes, Cruz says he refuses to play the media’s “gotcha” game and wants to talk about issues Americans care about. He blasts Obama for sipping mojitos with Communist dictators in Cuba but not having the time to meet with dissidents. He blasts the left for glorifying “chic” dictators.   8:20: Kasich says Trump’s language re: riots is “not acceptable” but does not answer question re: whether he will call the Ohio National Guard for the convention. 8:18: Kasich blasts Romney for his robocalls. He notes that CNN’s poll found him doing the best against Clinton in the general. He says he has the   policy experience to beat Clinton. When asked about Cruz’s comments that Kasich is auditioning to be Trump’s vice president, Kasich says there is “zero” chance he will be the vice president for either. 8:15: Kasich again says he favors a path to legalization and not citizenship re: immigration. He’s given the answer about 767, 765. 46484 times this election season. And reporters keep asking him the same question. [Tony Lee: At some point, these candidate forums that the networks have to get ratings become tedious. Viewers may want to just rather watch NIT basketball, the women’s NCAA tournament or even shows like Gotham and Castle. Town hall events where regular people get to ask unscripted questions are much more compelling.] 8:02: CNN reporters are interviewing the five candidates tonight. First up is Kasich with Anderson Cooper. He says there could be some   communications that could lead to peace in the Middle East. When asked about Jerusalem being the “eternal capital” of Israel, Kasich says “take the statement for what it is. It is the eternal capital of Israel. ” Kasich, responding to Trump’s comments on NATO, says we have to strengthen NATO because “we want our allies to share intelligence with us” and they have to be in the coalition that would destroy ISIS. He says he would never speak like Trump re: NATO because you have to be careful what you say as a leader. “He’s dead wrong on NATO,” he says. Kasich says it was a “terrible mistake” to overthrow Qaddafi in Libya.   8:00: Joel Pollak’s grades for all of the candidates at AIPAC. 7:28: According to one reporter, crowd more enthusiastic about Trump than Cruz: Ted Cruz just gave a     speech to AIPAC, and he got less applause than Donald Trump did.

Trump says there are children being taught every day to hate Israel and the Jews. “It has to stop,” he says. “When  you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the  heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can’t let this continue. ” Trump says you can’t have peace when martyrs are treated as heroes. 6:44: Trump says you can’t reward terror and “there’s only one way you treat that kind of behavior —  you have to confront it. ” He also says a U. N. peace deal would “delegitimize” Israel and he would veto any U. N. deal that would impose its will on the Jewish state. Looks like @realDonaldTrump is killing it at #AIPAC. Not for everyone.

Mark “OZ” Geist said: “We, perhaps more than any Americans, know the absolute and imperative reason that we elect Donald J. Trump as President of the United States. First and foremost, under a Trump administration, the request for additional security by an ambassador would have been heeded, and second, there is no question, when the attack came, he would have moved heaven and earth to provide the necessary forces to protect and reinforce our warriors. Mr. Trump is the bold, decisive leader America needs at this time. ” John Tiegen said: “It is very clear to see the groundswell of support, never seen before in recent politics.

He says “you’re a phenomena. We’re all a phenomena. ” He points out that he is on top while spending the least amount of money. And he says wouldn’t it be great if the country got a similar back for its buck. 6:33: Trump praises THE ALABAMA CRIMSON TIDE football team and says “I love champs. ” “You got a helluva coach,” Trump says of Nick Saban, who grew up in West Virginia among hardscrabble,   Americans similar to ones who are supporting Trump and may arguably be the greatest college coach ever. Trump says he has never met Saban and doesn’t know his politics. 6:32: Trump says American can’t become great until we become a “rich nation. ” Trump says “I don’t want your money” but “I want you to do one thing” —  vote on Tuesday. 6:31: Trump says illegal immigrants are treated better than the vets and taken care of better. “We’re not going to let that happen anymore,” Trump says. 6:29: After a plane flies overhead, Trump blasts today’s depleted military. Trump blasts military leaders for telling the enemy that our military is depleted. He says building up our military is the “cheapest thing to do” for our national security. Trump insists he doesn’t want to use it. Trump says China is building a military fortress in the South China Sea without going through environmental impact studies. He mocks Obama for complaining about the carbon footprint while taking Air Force One to Hawaii to play golf. Trump says Obama plays more golf than people on the PGA tour. “We’re going to get our jobs back,” he says. “We’re going to take care of our military  …     we’re going to take are of our vets. ” ”It’s ISIS get ‘em down,” @realDonaldTrump says as small single engine plane flies overhead,  —   Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) February 28, 2016,  6:25: Trump says “we’re losing our country” because of unfair trade deals. He says China is the greatest chess master at manipulating currency. He says he loves that Sessions is opposed to Obamatrade because it is “another Iran Deal” that is “horrible” and will “destroy jobs. ” He will levy a 35% tax on Carrier, Ford and other countries that move their plants overseas. He blast the “bloodsuckers” who support Rubio. He says they have “such power” over our Senators. He says the Senators know these deals are bad but agree to them because they get paid in campaign contributions and “things we don’t know about. Probably other things. ” Trump says he is 100% sure that these companies will stay in America when he is president. 6:24: Trump: “When I get Jeff Sessions, that means a lot to me. ” 6:23: Trump: “I’m becoming mainstream” with all these endorsements. 6:22: Trump says “we’re going to turn things around” on trade. He says we have the greatest business minds in the world and we don’t use them. Trump says we instead have political hacks who get their positions because of their political contributions to negotiate trade deals. 6:20: Trump praises Jerry Falwell Jr. and Sarah Palin. He says Falwell said Trump most reminds me of my father. Trump says Falwell Jr. told him his father endorsed Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter even though Reagan was less religious because he thought Reagan would be a better president. 6:17: Trump calls Karl Rove a “moron” and says Republicans will never win another election listening to people like Rove.  He mocks the mainstream media for saying he has hit his ceiling every time his poll numbers go up. Trump says the media first thought his ceiling was at 15% and now he is at 44% in a Reuters poll. 6:13: Trump says he won’t be beholden to lobbyists like  . He says his whole life has been about “money accumulation” but now he has to turn down millions of dollars.

Trump says what China has done to the United States is the “greatest theft” in the history of the world. Trump’s says he wishes our leaders were doing to China what they are doing to us. He says he won’t buy Carrier air conditioners after the company moved to Mexico. 6:05: Trump says “little Marco” and Cruz said they would build a border wall after Trump first made the promise. He says Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed him, which means he is the strongest on the border. Trump says after he, in Rush Limbaugh’s words, took so much “incoming” for standing against illegal immigration, then people came over to his side. He says he talked about borders and trade and “it morphed into something much different” after the   Bernardino attacks. He says “people started to look at me for safety and protection. ” Trump says “we’re going to protect our country” militarily and at the border. Trump says our country can’t lose $500 billion to China because of terrible trade deals. Trump says he is a free trader but we have to get something out of it and he is not a free trader if we are going to lose $500 billion to China. 6:02: Trump says “all hell broke loose” when he talked about illegal immigration when he announced his campaign. He says he has friends  in California and Texas who have told him about the illegal immigration problem. He also has friends who have been addicted to drugs and knew about the illegal immigration problem when D. C. elites were clueless. He says we wouldn’t be talking about illegal immigration had it not been for him. 5:58: Trump slams Rubio for supporting Disney’s plan to bring in foreign workers. He blasts the Omnibus budget and says “we are going to have wonderful budgets” and build up our military, “which is so depleted. ” He says our military is so depleted from mismanagement and listening to people like Lindsey Graham saying drop bombs on everybody.  Trump says Putin will not get anything for calling Trump a “genius. ” He says “what’s wrong with having Russia” work with us to drop bombs on ISIS. He seems flattered that Putin called him a genius and says he won’t disavow it. 5:55: Trump says the New York Times is one of the most dishonest media outlets. He says it is “losing its shirt” and someone is going to buy it as a vanity project. 5:52: Fox News is not televising Trumps rally. It has an Oscars special on instead.

He says, “isn’t it fun to be at a Trump rally. It’s part of the deal. ” Trump blasts Bernie Sanders for allowing Black Lives Matter protesters to take over his microphone. He says nobody will take over his microphone because they are “taking it away from you. ” Trump says Clinton should not be allowed to run because she broke the law. He vows to hammer her on her email scandals. [Earlier, Andrea Mitchell said the Clintons are worried that Trump will attack Clinton on her scandals in ways they can’t prepare for in advance] 5:48: Trump says he thought Rubio was going to faint at the debate. He says “we don’t need a fainter” to negotiate with Putin or knock out ISIS. Trump says Rubio is now trying to act tough. He blasts Rubio for charging personal expenses on the Florida GOP’s credit card and only reimbursing the party after he got caught. He also slams Rubio for selling his home to a lobbyist who had business before him. Trump says, unlike Rubio, he is   his campaign and not beholden to special interests that need to be taken care of. 5:47: “All Lives Matter,” Trump says to Black Lives Matter protesters.

He calls him “nasty” and “little Marco. ” 5:42: “That is so great,” Trump says. “He’s an incredible guy. ” Trump says there has never been at time where we’ve made so many decisions that have been so wrong like the Iran Deal and the border deal. He is honored that he received Sessions’s first presidential primary endorsement as a Senator. “You’re going to be so proud of your president,” Trump says. “They’re not proud now. ” 5:41: Sessions says the American people have known for years that these trade agreements have not been working for them. Sessions says Trump will ensure that Obamatrade, which will undermine our sovereignty, does not pass as president. Sessions says Trump doesn’t take money from political groups and lobbyists and is “committed to leading this country in an effective way. ” Sessions says nobody is perfect but “it is time to make America Great again. ” He puts on one of Trump’s hats as the crowd chants “USA!

He asks, “have they done it?” Crowd responds, “no. ” Sessions says “Donald Trump will do it. ” 5:37: Trump says Sessions is the “expert” on borders and almost everything else. “We want strong borders,” Trump says. “We want the wall. ” Trump blasts   President Vicente Fox for using a “horrible,  horrible” word. Trump says Fox is “very angry” because he is not used to Mexico being told what to do. Trump says people will only come into our country legally. 5:35: Trump takes the stage to “Sweet Home Alabama. ” “This is amazing,” he says. “I can listen to that music all day long. ” 5:30: Nearly 20, 000 people are watching the lifestream of Trump’s Alabama event.

Jeff Sessions ( ). Sessions, the intellectual leader of the future of the conservative movement, has provided the brainpower behind the populist nationalist revolt against political elites that’s been emerging since at least 2013. At a warm and windy rally here with thousands present in a packed football stadium just outside Huntsville, Sessions will appear on stage with Trump to back him for president. Sessions’ endorsement provides Trump with even more legitimacy as Trump’s two remaining serious opponents —  Sens. Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) —  attempt to undermine him in a desperate bid by the donor class to regain control of the party from populists revolting in elections around the country. Sessions backing Trump is a significant blow to both Rubio and Cruz, as now the powerful Alabamian will be putting his entire operation all in behind Trump.

       "        <td> (CNN) CNN commentators and guest analysts offer their take on Sunday night’s second presidential candidate debate. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors, David Gergen: Trump blows a big one  Whatever chance Donald Trump still had of capturing the White House largely evaporated Sunday night in his second debate with Hillary Clinton.   Coming off the worst 10 days of any campaign in recent history, Trump desperately needed a win in order to reverse his slide in the polls.  He was indeed better than in the first debate and she was not as commanding.  Even so, he blew his opportunity for victory in the first 20 minutes and could never fully recover.  CNN’s poll found that by  % a majority of voters watching them thought she got the best of him.   His loss came through a series of bizarre moments.  The first was his surprise   appearance with four female accusers of Bill Clinton. While a case can be made for   their claims of long ago, the event seemed like a stunt and Trump never made real use of it in the debate.   But more damning still was the way he handled the disgusting video from 11 years ago in which he made vulgar sexual remarks.  Trump could possibly have achieved a measure of forgiveness if he had issued a sincere, thoughtful apology about his past as well as some ugly incidents in this campaign. But his apology was limited in scope, seemed slightly dismissive, and went off track when he mixed ISIS into the conversation.   Adding insult to injury, he then went into an incredulous rant about Hillary’s deleted emails. It was an entirely legitimate attack until he vowed that if elected, he would ”instruct” his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue her and that if he were President today, she would be in jail. Say what?  Those are the way   dictators act, jailing their political opponents.  If he had done a half hour studying up (something that seems beyond him) he would know that under the law, a president can request    but not order    the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor and Justice must then make a decision independent from White House control.  Trump has a strange tropism toward Richard Nixon, forgetting that such safeguards were put in place precisely because of his abuses of power.   Overall, Trump’s debate performance may have given heart to his base supporters, stopping his slide, but did little to bring new voters into the fold, especially women.  Voter preferences are now hardening, and more trouble could lie ahead.   In the next few days, we will learn whether the RNC and other GOP stalwarts rally behind him or pull more plugs.  We will see, too, whether he and his vice presidential pick, Michael Pence, patch up their differences.   Having told moderator Anderson Cooper that he never actually groped or assaulted any women the way he bragged about in the tape, Trump’s apology also leaves him wide open to new women contradicting his claims and to new tapes of scurrilous remarks.  Hillary’s team shouldn’t yet measure the drapes in the Oval Office, but I bet their transition folks are now working with fresh energy.  Victory    and perhaps a big one    seems almost within their grasp.  Errol Louis: Trump’s shocking threat, Donald Trump, with his campaign on the ropes, came out swinging. He made a few solid points, especially on reforming the tax code, but otherwise seemed irritated and irritable, in a continuation of the meltdown that began after a leaked video on Friday showed him making lewd comments about women.  Trump struggled with the town   format, frequently looming over Clinton as she answered questions, interrupting her frequently and bickering with moderators Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper over whether he got enough time to respond to questions.  At other points his assertions were downright shocking, such as his blunt threat to, as president, have a special investigator look into Hillary Clinton’s emails and potentially jail her. He also admitted not having paid federal income tax for decades, implying that other wealthy Americans do the same and blaming Clinton for not reforming the tax code during her years in the Senate.  Another startling moment was Trump’s admission he and his running mate, Mike Pence, haven’t discussed key Syria policies and actually disagree on the key issue of whether to launch military strikes at the forces of Syrian dictator Bashar   a direct contradiction of what Pence said at the recent vice presidential candidates’ debate. Trump did well enough to keep his campaign alive and give hope to his supporters    but his debate performance did little to counter Clinton’s main angle of attack: that he’s simply not qualified or prepared to serve as president.  Errol Louis is the host of ”Inside City Hall,” a nightly political show on NY1, a New York   channel. Tara Setmayer: Trump’s strategy    Attack, attack, attack  Donald Trump’s behavior during the first 20 minutes of the debate was cringe worthy.  To no one’s surprise there was no sign of the ”humility” or ”contrition” many, including his own supporters, called for in response to the devastating video released on Friday showing Trump bragging about groping women in the most vile terms.  Instead, he chose to pivot and go directly on the attack against Hillary Clinton every chance he got.     At times, Trump brought the level of discourse embarrassingly low with all sense of presidential decorum thrown out the window. Gone were the pleasantries and respect with Trump referring to Mrs. Clinton as a pronoun (she, her) throughout the evening. Clearly this was done on purpose to diminish Clinton.  She handled it like a seasoned professional, making her look like the adult in the room. Trump once again demonstrated why he’s temperamentally unfit for the presidency.   However, once the conversation turned to more substantive topics, Trump was able to focus more on Clinton’s failed record, forcing her to play defense for much of the night, particularly on her emails,  Obamacare and energy policy.     Trump did falter badly on Syria. He seemingly sided with Putin over his own running mate, emphatically saying he disagreed with Mike Pence on the policy and hadn’t even spoken to him about the crisis in Syria.   Heading into this debate, Trump’s campaign was possibly mortally wounded. He performed well enough to stop the bleeding, for now. But did he do anything to close the gap with key swing state constituencies he needs to win? Doubtful. Fortunately for Trump, Hillary Clinton is such a flawed candidate, she was unable to land the knockout blow.  This one was a draw.  Tara Setmayer is former communications director for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,   and a CNN political commentator.   Tim Stanley: Will Trump’s good night make a difference? Donald Trump had a good night. It started poorly because it had to start poorly discussion of his ”locker room” banter was bound to be personally embarrassing. He sounded like he was giving a legal deposition. When Clinton and the moderators demanded greater clarity, he lost his temper and called Bill Clinton an abuser of women. I suspect he didn’t intend to do that. The man has skin as thin as gossamer. But after that the debate turned to Clinton, and Trump’s constant attacks were effective. The problem is that while Trump is an eccentric candidate, Clinton is a poor one. She struggled to explain why she was running, overused cliches and gave lawyerly answers that sounded like she was squirming. She even let Trump tell a good gag at her expense about Abraham Lincoln. But how do we judge victory in this unpredictable climate? For Trump it will be warm words from senior Republicans and an end to GOP withdrawals from his campaign.  That does not spell victory in November. Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain’s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of ”Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L. A. and D. C. Revolutionized American Politics.”   Sally Kohn: A depressing spectacle, I’m depressed.  I’m depressed that Donald Trump could be caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women and try to laugh it all off in a debate as ”locker room talk.”  But what were the debate moderators supposed to do Sunday night?  Spend more than a few minutes conveying America’s utter disgust at this latest example of Trump’s pattern of misogyny?  Nah, a few minutes is enough I guess.  So on to policy, right?  No, because almost as depressing was Trump’s repeated unwillingness to actually answer the questions that were posed to him.  How would Trump ensure that   conditions are still covered by health insurance without some sort of universal coverage mandate?  We don’t know, he didn’t answer.   What would Trump do about the refugee crisis in Syria?  We don’t know, he didn’t answer  —   twice.  Question after question, Trump said nothing.  I mean, words came out of his mouth but they barely formed sentences and they definitely didn’t form thoughts.  He basically vomited fragments of nothingness all over Hillary Clinton and America.  And like Clinton, we all just had to sit there  —   frustrated and annoyed.    What’s especially depressing is that our media, let alone our democracy, seems   to handle anything like Trump.  Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper tried, but fact checking Trump doesn’t work because Trump doesn’t care about facts.  In fact, he denies he’s lying as he’s lying and then, for extra audacity, accuses everyone else of being liars.  I keep waiting for the ghost of George Orwell to show up on the debate stage and bite Trump on the ankles.  Donald Trump is a perverse man who is perverting not only our democracy but the very concept of truth.  He tried to win the debate just like one wins a limbo contest  —   by lowering the bar.  That should depress all of us.    Sally Kohn, a CNN political commentator, is an activist and columnist. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn.  She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency. S. E. Cupp: A night of missed opportunities, After the past 48 hours, it’s difficult to determine on what basis either candidate would win Sunday night’s debate. Donald Trump was emerging out of the fallout from a blistering, embarrassing, potentially fatal recording of him suggesting he’s used his celebrity to sexually assault women. In the hours before the debate, he gathered four women who claim they’d been victims of either Hillary Clinton’s husband or her to exploit their pain for his own personal gain.  Clinton, on the other hand, suffered a significant, if overshadowed, leak about her previously private speeches.  But it’s safe to say, Clinton came in with the advantage, and Trump came in with an almost impossible recovery mission. He did little to recover, but it’s also hard to see where she used that advantage effectively. He was undisciplined and puerile, whining about the moderators treating him unfairly, which is never a winning strategy. He missed obvious openings to attack Clinton, for example, on the revelations she’s advocated for open borders in those private speeches. He lurked behind her uncomfortably while she spoke, a visual he was either unaware of or maybe actually totally aware of.  But while Clinton was cool and collected, and seemed far more comfortable than he did, she had a clear strategy to wait for Trump to hang himself, instead of going for the jugular on the easy issue. She had an opportunity tonight to end his campaign for good, either by baiting him into a trap or just throwing a knockout. I’m not sure she did either.  Undecided and independent voters will have to decide if they respect her for taking the high ground, or judge her for failing to more aggressively call him out.  S. E. Cupp is the author of ”Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media’s Attack on Christianity,”   of ”Why You’re Wrong About the Right” and a columnist at the New York Daily News. Jeff Yang: Moderators were winners, Trump was not  It’s hard to imagine that there are pundits who are calling this debate a draw    or even a ”victory on points” for Trump. He blustered, he blathered, he blazed a   trail of spite and fury across the stage, and through it all, Clinton remained cool, collected and, dare I say it, presidential.  Every slur and slander from 30 years of unhinged Clinton hatred was dragged before the audience of ”uncommitted voters” (is there really such a thing as a Muslim American uncommitted voter? ). None of the attacks stuck, because they seemed nasty and irrelevant, and put Trump in the position of being a barker for a particularly unpleasant sideshow.  What did stick was the impression that even a modulated Trump is entirely unfit for office. His fascistic vow to investigate and jail Clinton upon election his throwing of his running mate Mike Pence under the runaway Trump Train his inability to directly answer any of the moderators’ questions    none of these could’ve given comfort to members of his party that a Trump win would be anything but Pyrrhic.  And as for the moderators Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz: Did someone slip PEDs into their drinking water? This is the first time we’ve seen this kind of muscular, unyielding and disciplined questioning from the floorkeepers at a debate, and the demand that the candidates actually engage the topics being asked was bracing and refreshing. More of the same at debate 3, please. ..if there is one after this utter fiasco of a week for the Trump campaign.

So it’s a good thing the moderators brought it up at the   giving Trump a chance to reiterate his apology, let Clinton get a jab in, and move his campaign forward.  Trump failed. He failed to take the opportunity to bury the story and instead   on the ”locker room talk” explanation. Trump failed to show his understanding of modern social norms, instead sticking to a sensibility stuck in the culture of the ’70s Playboy mansion. And he failed to assuage his Republican colleagues, who are abandoning his campaign in droves, that he can speak to women voters.  Even scarier, Trump openly admitted to not understanding laws designed to protect women in response to a direct question from moderators, Trump ”wouldn’t say that” grabbing women’s genitalia is considered sexual assault.  On Friday night, President Obama signed the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Rights Act. By contrast Trump spent the next 72 hours defending ”locker room talk” and rape culture. Expect the narrative and evidence of Trump being harmful to women to dominate this coming week.

She supports Hillary Clinton. Peniel Joseph: It’s officially the ’Hunger Games’ With the revelation of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump’s bragging about sexual assault during a 2005 taping of an entertainment television show, the 2016 presidential election has officially turned into a ”Hunger Games” styled nightmare for the American people.   Trump’s repulsive comments about women cast a shadow over Sunday night’s second presidential debate in St. Louis. Over the weekend, scores of   members of the Republican establishment finally reached their breaking point, openly calling for Trump to drop out of the race.  Moderator Anderson Cooper bluntly asked Trump whether he realized his comments about kissing and groping women without permission amounted to a confession of sexual assault.   Trump characterized his comments as ”locker room talk” and claimed to have ”great respect for women.” Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton identified Trump as unfit to lead, by virtue of the latest controversy and the litany of racist, sexist and xenophobic comments the billionaire real estate developer has made throughout the campaign.  Trump, who invited to the debate three women who claimed to be victims of sexual harassment and assault by former President Bill Clinton, responded with a surreal defense of his own words by attacking former President Bill Clinton as a sexual predator enabled by Hillary Clinton.  The most bizarre presidential debate in history featured Trump, a candidate rejected by many of his own party’s leaders, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to reopen the FBI investigation into her emails. Clinton countered that she was grateful a man like Trump was not president. ”Because you’d be in jail,” Trump shot back, in a line that served as red meat to his core base of supporters.   Faced with insurrection in the ranks of the Republican Party on a historic scale, Trump fought back through his most unvarnished display of anger, petulance and disingenuous concern for the plight of   and Latinos, two groups he’s routinely offended during his campaign.    Clinton found her rhetorical footing answering questions about rising Islamophobia that Trump’s calls for bans on Muslims have greatly contributed to. Clinton offered a nuanced vision of American society that included Muslim Americans and differentiated between religious extremists who advocate terror and ordinary Americans who happen to practice the Islamic faith.  Ultimately, this second debate, which featured no opening handshake between two candidates who apparently despise one another, illustrated more than just the polarizing nature of contemporary American politics.  Trump’s fitness for the presidency has now been openly questioned by some of the leading figures in his own party, including former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice (who asked him to withdraw) and Arizona Sen. John McCain (who rescinded his endorsement).   Verbal fisticuffs between Trump and Clinton over emails, tax returns, and sexual assault have turned a presidential contest into a brutal spectator sport filled with vulgar exchanges that made the spectacle unfit to be watched by children. A largely substance free example of the worst kind of political theater  —   one largely devoid of serious policy discussion  —   this debate exemplified how modern day American politics has reached a historic low.

He is the author of several books, most recently ”Stokely: A Life.”  Julian Zelizer: Clinton missed a knockout punch, Donald Trump attempted to move away from the ”Access Hollywood” controversy by returning to the themes that animated his primary campaign. He returned to threats from ISIS, illegal immigration, liberal Supreme Court justices and Hillary Clinton’s scandals  —   from   to paid speeches to her husband’s sexual past.  At moments he lashed out against Clinton in Trumpian fashion, going so far as to call her the ”devil” and saying that if he was president she would be in jail. He painted her as a liar and professional politician who says one thing and then does something else.  If the goal was to stop, at least temporarily, the incessant discussion of his comments on the bus with Billy Bush and the calls for him to step down, Trump was successful. He probably   some of his base and turned attention back to Clinton’s controversies. There were several moments when Clinton found herself on the defense and stumbled in her responses. The problem is that the debate can’t remake the basic character of this candidacy or the problems that he has created. The ”Access Hollywood” tapes were the tip of a very big iceberg. He apologized for the comments, yet without much gusto. On top of that, there are very likely more Trump controversies on the way.  The long list of prominent Republicans who have announced they now will not vote for Trump is well known. The deep record of polarizing and controversial positions and statements won’t go away.  Within this debate itself, there were many occasions when Trump reminded undecided voters about why so many Republicans are not on his side. When he threatened to put his opponent in jail on live television he crossed another boundary in campaign history. He even seems to disagree about policy with his vice presidential running mate.  The reason the tape had such an impact was because of who Trump has been and the kind of campaign that he has run since entering the race. It is hard to see how this debate enables Trump to broaden his electoral base, which is essential if he wants to win.  While Trump was able to use this debate to shift attention away from the recording, he didn’t score a ”win” in terms of the overall quality of the debate (his answers were filled with misstatements, vague references and scattershot statements on unrelated issues) and he didn’t erase the problems that he has created for his party. However, Clinton didn’t accomplish the kind of ”knockout” punch that her supporters were hoping for.  Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ”Jimmy Carter” and ”The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.” Frida Ghitis: Trump showed he doesn’t get it, The top question on everyone’s mind was how Trump would handle the issue of the tape in which he speaks in deeply offensive ways about women. On that topic, he showed he absolutely does not get it. ”This was locker room talk,” he said several times (then awkwardly pivoted to talk about ISIS.) And even though he added, ”I’m not proud of it. I apologize. ..,” the repeated mantra that it was ”locker room talk” showed he believes it’s only natural, really OK for men to refer to women in those terms, and perhaps even to sexually assault women in the way he described in that tape. That may satisfy his core supporters. In fact, his entire performance may have played well with his most devoted followers, but it’s hard to imagine that many independents watched this debate and decided to vote for Trump. His base feels good now, but he didn’t persuade many undecideds, and certainly didn’t peel away any Clinton supporters. He came across as a rude, overbearing and nasty man. ”She has tremendous hate in her heart,” he said, looming over Hillary Clinton and pacing while she spoke. When he spoke, she sat listening, almost never interrupting him, even when he lied a painful sacrifice Clinton has decided she must make in order not to be seen as ”pushy,” or ”unlikable,” or some other ”unfeminine” trait. In one   moment, Trump threatened to put Hillary Clinton in prison if he becomes president, marking a new low for American democracy in an election season filled with new lows.  Some of his attacks on Clinton landed forcefully, such as on her emails and speeches. Clinton could have defended herself more forcefully and attacked more frequently.  But the overwhelming tone of the debate was one of Trump making harsh personal attacks against his rival, pleasing   and turning off voters trying to make up their minds. On foreign policy, it was also one shocking statement after another. He said he disagreed with his running mate Mike Pence and his roundly praised statements on Syria. Pence said he would consider attacking Russia and the Syrian regime if they don’t stop the slaughter in Aleppo. Trump said no, and offered a policy that surely brought cheers in Damascus and Syria.  Then he made bizarre statements, such as ”Russia is new in terms of nuclear, we are old and tired.” Trump repeated old lies, such as the claim that he opposed the war in Iraq. When Clinton said that claim had been debunked (as it has) he cut in, leaning into the microphone and uttering ”Has not been debunked,” sounding like Alec Baldwin playing Donald Trump. On the whole, Trump put on a performance that undoubtedly made his diehard fans feel reassured, but one that confirmed that he does not understand what is wrong with his attitude toward women, toward Muslims and toward Russia, and reminding us that he has a jumbled, dangerous foreign policy, and continues to undercut America’s fundamental democratic traditions.

Haroon Moghul: The real message of the night, We shouldn’t have invaded Iraq, Donald Trump now says. But he also says we should’ve ”taken their oil.” Guarding immobile, sometimes flammable infrastructure, while plundering and pillaging a sovereign nation is colonialism. Had more Republicans actually paid attention to ”take their oil,” at least they wouldn’t have been surprised by ”grab them by the    .”  Because Islamophobia is misogyny is racism. My God, my race, my wealth, my gender, or what have you, permits me to do unto you as I’d never accept being done unto me. Take their oil. Settle their land. Grope their bodies.  In response to a question about Islamophobia, Trump told an allegedly undecided Muslim voter —   a term that makes about as much sense as ”clean coal”    that we have to keep in mind the problem of terrorism.  If the moderators had been bolder, they’d have asked Donald Trump if the violence by radical white supremacists permits us to infringe on the rights of white Americans generally.  We should not, as Melania Trump pleaded, simply forgive her husband’s indiscretions, and move on to ”the important issues.” The average Trump voter is not motivated by economic anxiety. Stop finding politically correct terms for blatant racists. They’d rather we undo decades of social progress than yield an inch on exploitative structures that keep them powerful.  As we were reminded this Friday, that privilege isn’t ever benign. It came about through violence, and maintains itself through violence: over bodies, over land, over culture. I’d hoped Trump would be out of the race by this weekend, but it seems even sexual predation isn’t enough to wake our country up. Don’t ask if Clinton won or lost. Ask what happened to us.

Raul Reyes: Trump’s   performance  Here is a note to all candidates at presidential debates: If you find yourself engaged in combative behavior with the moderators, you have lost the debate.  At the combination town   debate that Politico described as ”the most consequential forum in history,” Donald Trump repeatedly clashed with the moderators and made himself look awfully small over the course of 90 minutes.  Overall, Hillary Clinton’s steady presence triumphed over Trump’s typically uneven performance.   From the start, Trump seemed exhausted and ”low energy” as he faced off with Clinton.  The first question of the night, about whether each candidate was modeling appropriate behavior for young people, was one that was certainly expected.  But Trump blew it.  He missed his chance to show genuine contrition for his recently revealed behavior.  Instead his explanation for his lewd remarks about the ”Access Hollywood” host and a soap opera actress was that it was ”locker room talk.”  This was a weak rationalization that will not improve his standing with women    or anyone who has ever been in a locker room in their life.      Trump’s body language was especially revealing tonight.  He fidgeted.  He paced the stage.  At times he lurked behind Clinton, giving off a creepy stalker vibe.  And, just like the last debate, he seemed stricken with a case of the sniffles.  These were all distractions on top of his rambling answers.  Consider that he answered a question from a Muslim woman about Islamophobia by apparently encouraging racial profiling of Muslim Americans.  Or that he may have conceded that he did not pay federal income taxes for years.            Worse, once again Trump could not resist interrupting Clinton, or making coarse comments    like his statement that if he were president, he would have a special prosecutor investigate her and that she would be jailed.  Does he not understand that using the judicial branch to go after your political opponents is against the law?  His statement that Clinton has ”tremendous hate in her heart” showed a stunning lack of   from the man who has disparaged Latinos, immigrants, a Gold Star family, a former Miss Universe, and people with disabilities    among others.      For her part, Clinton provided clear answers on her positions on everything from the Affordable Care Act to Syria. She was prepared for the inevitable questions about WikiLeaks and her deleted emails.  Her best answer of the evening was likely when she enumerated the qualifications she would look for in a Supreme Court justice.   This was the rare evening where Trump faced a high bar in terms of what he had to accomplish.  Not only did he not manage effective damage control of his latest scandal, it seems unlikely that he won over any undecided or independent voters tonight.  However, he likely may have alienated some with his boorish, petulant behavior on full display.   Toward the end of this town hall debate that featured relatively few questions from the audience, Trump described the American nuclear program as ”we’re old, we’re tired, we’re exhausted.” He could have been describing his   performance.

Roxanne Jones: A pitch to his base, If I were watching a Vegas lounge act, I may have gotten a few chuckles at some of Donald Trump’s quick comebacks during the debate. Too bad, this is a campaign for the highest office in the land, and not a comedy night. It’s not   most voters are looking for but substance, strategy and clear vision to move America forward. We deserve so much more from the man who wants to be President. After coming out of the box sounding more like a playground punk, Trump  picked it up a bit when he took Hillary Clinton to task for deleting thousands of emails while she was Secretary of State.  She apologized (again) took responsibility (again) and said if she had it to do over again, she would not have used her private server. Clinton  was wrong. She was investigated and cleared of any illegal acts. You either believe her, or not. Move on. Unemployment rates in the U. S. stand at 5. 0% that’s 7. 9 million out of work Americans. For blacks and Hispanics, the picture is bleaker (Black 8. 3% Hispanics 6. 4%). And notice that Trump did not deny sending jobs to China by buying   Chinese metal to build his buildings. Not exactly a winning jobs strategy for Americans.  Voters are worried about sending their children to college, about Social Security, clean air, terrorism. Will the next President send our sons and daughters to war? Trump doesn’t seem to be too worried about the Middle East. He shockingly admitted that he ”hadn’t talked to Pence” about Aleppo, and when pressed by moderator Martha Raddatz, he couldn’t come up with one detailed answer about how he would handle the war in Syria. One of the major issues of our time and he has no plan. That’s beyond troubling.  But then again, I suspect, talking about foreign policy, a solid jobs plan, college costs are not topics that come up during ”locker room banter,” where apparently Trump does his best talking, bragging about groping women and encouraging sex assault. So while Trump may have looked more poised than what we saw in his bombastic behavior during the first debate, he did little to appeal to voters outside of his diehard followers, for whom he can do no wrong. And he’ll need more than them to win.  I’ve been in my share of locker rooms covering sports over the past 20 years and while lewd talk is real, I’ve yet to hear an athlete use the crude, childlike words Trump used describing how he approaches women: ”Grab them by the p —  y. . .. You can do anything.”  Clinton was in a tough position, after Trump’s ”groping” video was released. She did well to avoid wading too deep into Trump’s gutter. The win goes to Clinton for staying on course. (And Martha Raddatz, the best moderator thus far.)

Tim Naftali: Bewildering debate didn’t move the needle, This debate was bewildering. The town hall forum at its best brings the issues down to the level of the individual citizen. This one did not and for that reason will not move many voters in either direction. Trump decided to bring his stump style to the national debate stage and Hillary Clinton responded more combatively than in the first debate. There was little chance of a policy debate, but with the exception of a few moments on health care and on the selection of a Supreme Court justice, most of the night descended into charges and countercharges. Trump looked better but his arguments on foreign policy, especially, though forceful, still did not meet the reality test. Clinton was clear but not as crisp this time. A draw.

Ruth  : Just words, folks?  They matter,  ”It’s just words, folks,” was Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s refrain during this debate. And yet words served him well in his strategies of denial, obfuscation, and direct attack.   Trump tried to talk his way out of his most recent offenses toward women, claiming his words were ”just locker room talk” while in the same sentence bizarrely calling in ISIS as an aid and a distraction: those crotch grabs? Not anything important, like ISIS chopping peoples’ heads off. Did I mention I will defeat ISIS? If you had trouble following his logic here or at other moments of the evening, you were not alone.    Clinton had a strong enough performance, but some of her fire was missing. Perhaps she wanted to give Trump the space to damage himself, but his repeated gambit of turning policy answers into personal attacks on her warranted a more energetic response.    The winner of this debate? The gentleman at the end who asked the candidates if there’s anything they respect about one another. He reminded us that words do matter. They can incite violence they prepare action. Yet they can also build bridges, something we’ll need an awful lot of after this election.

It was more tawdry, more personal, and nastier that any political event I’ve ever witnessed. Everyone felt the effects. I sat next to a Trump supporter and directly in front of a   Democrat. They maintained decorum, but wrapped it in disgust.  The debate broke little new ground substantively, but the tone set a new standard for nasty, personal and brutish.  Donald Trump looked like a wounded animal on stage    pacing, lashing out in anger, snarling the words ”disaster” and accusing his rival of ”lies” so many times, I lost count. When he threatened to appoint a special prosecutor if he’s elected and send her to jail, the room gasped. So did my Trump and Clinton   ”focus group.}   Hillary Clinton was more controlled. She perched on her chair whenever she could, perhaps to keep her disdain for Trump from exploding into the open.  What do you suppose she was thinking when Trump went after Bill Clinton’s affairs and her role running interference? There was some debate on the issues    Syria, the Supreme Court, health care and jobs. But the focus was on the candidates, each trying to outmaneuver, insult or corner the other.  St. Louis made history of sorts and I’ll remember lots of things about it. Like when the house lights went down in the minutes before the debate and it struck me just how dark it got.

       "        <td>Every week or so during the spring, I met with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the party headquarters on Capitol Hill. We fell into a familiar routine. I would enter his office, usually chaperoned by Sean Spicer, the R. N. C. ’s chief strategist and head of communications. Priebus has a healthy appreciation for gallows humor, which is not a bad thing for an R. N. C. chairman these days. “I haven’t started pouring Baileys in my cereal yet,” he says often enough that it has become a signature line. I would regularly break the ice with something sarcastic, like asking Priebus how his party’s Hispanic outreach program was going on the morning after the committee’s head of Hispanic outreach resigned rather than work another day for Donald Trump’s election. “The scent of party unity is in the air,” I said in May when Paul Ryan reported that he was “not there yet” on supporting Trump. “No, that’s incense,” Priebus said, pointing out that he had been burning some behind his desk. As suits a man occupying what might be the toughest political job in America, Priebus does his best to stay availed of serene distractions. He plays jazz piano at home late at night and gazes into the   saltwater fish tank that he keeps next to his desk. “You see that big eel?” Priebus asked one day, pointing out a black slithery creature on the bottom, before noting others. “That’s a yellow tang, hippo tang, a spotted puffer. There’s an anemone. An urchin. An orange clown fish. ” He took a hunk of shrimp from a refrigerator and dangled it with a set of tongs into the water. A race to the bottom ensued as bits fell away and the fish vied for pieces of flesh. It was difficult to look away from the feeding frenzy. The big orange clown fish flailed at front and center. I asked Priebus if it reminded him of anyone. “That’s not funny,” he said with something between a slight grunt and chuckle. No matter how much Trump has roiled the Republican water, it remained Priebus’s job to carry it. The presumed Republican nominee appears on many days to be at open war with the party that is about to nominate him. The entire campaign, meanwhile, has been a proxy battle for the proverbial “soul of the party” that has been escalating between the G. O. P. ’s populist grass roots (captured by Trump) and “party leaders” (embodied by Priebus, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell). Is the G. O. P. now the “party of Trump”? Priebus bristles when people ask him this  —   or taunt him. I asked Priebus some variation on this question during each of my visits. “Donald Trump is Donald Trump,” Priebus says. “And the party is the party. ” “Priebus” is a German name, pronounced like the Toyota Prius with a “b” stuck in the middle. Reince (short for Reinhold, rhymes with “pints”) is 44 but has an  ’s vibe. He is often underslept, has the beginnings of jowls and tiny goose pimples clustered under his eyes like those on the belly of a toad. He speaks in the slow and slightly   manner of an adolescent whose parents are always hassling him about the nightmare house guest. The Trump issue, in other words. It’s never far from anything, and really, these days, what else is there? Plenty, Priebus kept trying to convince me. The Republican Party had its own distinct identity and principles and points of pride. It controls both chambers of Congress and holds more federal and statewide seats than at any time since 1900, he said. What keeps eluding Republicans is the White House. They have lost the popular vote in five of the last six national elections. “Cultural elections,” Priebus calls them  —   “the big ones. ” A chief reason for this is that many voters dismiss Republicans as being culturally and demographically stuck in 1900. It was Priebus who commissioned and endorsed the findings of the G. O. P. “autopsy” after Mitt Romney’s defeat in 2012. Formally christened as the “Growth and Opportunity Project,” the report warned that the G. O. P. was “increasingly marginalizing itself” to a point where it would be “increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future. ” That is, the report concluded, unless the party expanded its aging white base to include more immigrants, ethnic minorities and women, precisely the groups the next likely   has so splendidly repelled. Priebus refers to himself as a “party guy. ” He spent much of his youth in Kenosha, Wis. organizing pizza parties for Republican volunteers, putting up yard signs and listening to Newt Gingrich speeches on cassettes in his car  —     things. His first date with his future wife included a trip to a Republican Lincoln Day dinner, an evening sexed up by the presence of two Republican congressmen: James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Henry Hyde of Illinois. Being a “party guy” can come off sounding a little   nerdy, like being a   guy. But Priebus speaks of this identity with sincere pride, and his allegiance is clear: to “the party,” not any one nominee. Still, our meetings sometimes took on the feel of therapy sessions, with Priebus playing the role of the betrayed spouse trying to convince me that his tormentor really could change. Trump would soon be “pivoting” into a more “presidential” mode, Priebus kept promising. But after a while it became clear that Trump’s outrages would continue unabated. Within the space of a few weeks, he suggested that Bill Clinton had committed rape and (along with Hillary) might have killed his former aide Vince Foster and that Ted Cruz’s father might have associated with Lee Harvey Oswald and that Mitt Romney walked like a penguin and. . .. Priebus pretty much stopped bothering with “presidential. ” On this particular day, cable news was    with stories: the surfacing of an audio tape of someone sounding a lot like Trump claiming to be a Trump “spokesman” the discovery of a Facebook post from Trump’s longtime butler calling for President Obama to be killed and news that the Trump campaign had selected a white nationalist leader to be a California delegate (the delegate wound up resigning). Priebus eventually pivoted to Trump’s supposed “authenticity. ” Yes, “authenticity” was a better word, more latitude. He settled on the idea that Trump was a “unique” candidate who had created a new standard for what a politician could say and get away with. “He’s carved out this idea that he’s this earthquake in a box,” Priebus says. Priebus was saying in effect that it would be possible to build a wall around Donald Trump and not have the G. O. P. pay for it. Trump did not define its values in the long term, even if he might temporarily defile them. “We’re the party of the ‘open door,’’u2009” Priebus told me, as he often does. Not big, beautiful walls. For a while this spring, it seemed possible to contain the earthquake. Trump showed flickering signs of “maturing” as a candidate, and Republicans seemed willing to “support the nominee,” if not endorse him. The “normalization” of Donald Trump became a media watchword, the idea that his daily affronts could be integrated into the routine paces of a quadrennial exercise. Formerly hostile primary opponents like Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal and Rick Perry all at various points said they would support Trump or were at least no longer (in Rubio’s case) deriding him as a “fraud,” “con man” and “lunatic” or (in Graham’s) a “  xenophobic, religious bigot” or (in Jindal’s) a “madman who must be stopped” or (in Perry’s) a “barking carnival act. ” I imagined Trump laughing at how easy it was to get Republicans to submit to him after he had savaged so many of them during the primaries. Actually there was no need to imagine because Trump was doing exactly that. “I’ve never seen people able to pivot like politicians,” he said at a rally in California in late May while boasting of his support from Perry. In an interview, I asked Trump if it was harder to flip politicians or the real estate people he has dealt with over the years. His smirk was audible over the phone. “Well, I’m not referring to any politicians in particular, but I’ve said many times that businesspeople are much tougher,” Trump said. “Politicians tend to be much more deceptive and deceiving and more willing to break a deal. But they are not as tough. ” Priebus, meanwhile, kept working the phones, trying to coax   Republicans back to the party line and persuade  —   beg  —   Trump to lay off the elected Republicans he kept dumping on. “I have encouraged him to constantly offer grace to people that he doesn’t think are deserving of grace,” Priebus said. Trump, in turn, calls Priebus “Mr. Switzerland” and speaks well of him. “Reince is a peacemaker, a very good person for getting people together,” he said. Trump was calling me from his limo after a rally in Anaheim, Calif. He was in the midst of an intrapartisan grudge tour of the American West, during which he disparaged, among other Republicans, Jeb Bush, the South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, and the New Mexico governor, Susana Martinez, who is one of the   Hispanic elected officials in the G. O. P. He also reiterated that Romney was a “loser” and a “choker” and for good measure boasted that “I have a store that’s worth more money than he is. ” Priebus’s mother is Greek, which he says trains him for dealing with whatever the Greek word for mishegas is. “Ever see ‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding’?” he asked. “That’s my family, that’s my life. The arguing starts at 7:30 in the morning, everyone’s in each other’s business. It was good family chaos. ” I asked if what the G. O. P. was going through now was “good family chaos. ” “It depends how it turns out,” he said. At this point in the    calendar four and eight years ago, Romney and John McCain had built massive campaign operations and   networks that were orders of magnitude larger than Trump’s. They had accumulated armies of elected officials promoting them and were diligently making peace with vanquished opponents and paying courtesy calls to party dignitaries and congressional leaders in the name of “unity. ” The period between the end of the primaries and the start of the conventions is typically one of consolidation,   harvesting and turning full attention to the   opponent  —   all of which Trump has succeeded in achieving the   opposite of. Trump would of course be the first to point out that both McCain and Romney lost and that he has been doubted at every step of his campaign. But the degree to which he seems unconcerned with his pariah status among name Republicans remains a key feature of his pursuit. To a comical extent, top Republicans willed themselves invisible when I reached out to them for this article, fearing, not incorrectly, that the conversation would turn to Trump. This included some of the most typically quotable Republicans, including former Trump challengers like Graham (“He’s sorta had his fill talking about Trump,” a spokesman emailed) Perry (“Thanks for thinking of him”) and Ted Cruz (“Not great timing on our end”) the previous nominee Mitt Romney (“You are kind to think of me,” he wrote) Trump stalwarts like Chris Christie (“We are going to take a pass this time”)   Republican governors like Charlie Baker of Massachusetts (“The governor won’t be available”) and senators like Mike Lee, of Utah (“Senator Lee would love to talk to you about the state of the G. O. P. and conservatism in general. We are free anytime after Nov 8. ”). I tried Rubio, who has undergone more public agony than perhaps anyone about Trump. Rubio looks nauseated whenever someone asks him about the man he called “the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency” but who later said he would be “honored” to speak for at the Republican convention before clarifying that if he did speak, he would only “speak about things I believe in, not somebody else’s platform. ” Rubio also holds the astonishing position of saying he’ll vote for someone he has previously declared unfit to hold the American nuclear codes. You envision him under a mushroom cloud, assuring his kids that it could be even worse  —   at least he didn’t vote for Clinton. There’s a palpable weariness among Republicans, and it’s still only June. Every day, it’s something else. “What it does is suck all the oxygen out of the chamber,” Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, told me. “I’m trying to do my job as a senator, which does not end because we have a contentious and bizarre presidential candidate. ” Trump, after accumulating enough delegates to win the nomination with almost no visible operation or recognizable strategy, has only nominally scaled his campaign beyond where it was a few months ago. There is barely any   or field apparatus to speak of, and Trump has outsourced a great deal of the   of an enormous   campaign to the overtasked R. N. C. Priebus has won praise for revamping the   data and field infrastructure that he inherited from his embattled predecessor, Michael Steele, in 2011. But no national committee in recent memory has been called upon to pick up as much operational slack in a general election. I asked Priebus if he was frustrated that so much has been thrown into the R. N. C. ’s lap. “It’s more frustrating for us when a campaign comes in and layers over our field staff,” is how he spun it. In addition to celebrating the presidential nominee, national conventions are a showcase for party eminences, rising stars and elected officials. Not so here. The last nominee, Romney, and two living former presidents, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, have said they are not supporting Trump or will not campaign for him. McCain has said he would be skipping the convention and is pursuing his senate   in Arizona with characteristically gritted teeth: the familiar “it pains me to do this” routine. Three of the top five   in the primaries  —   Cruz, Jeb Bush and the Ohio governor John Kasich  —   have either made no commitment to support Trump or, in Bush’s case, said definitively he would not support him. A fourth, Rubio, in addition to his prolonged and winding agony over Trump, has said he does “not want to be considered” as Trump’s running mate. This is a popular distancing trick doubling as a nifty   among reluctant Trump endorsers. “To the members of the press who are asking, while I am flattered to be mentioned,” Nikki Haley said, “my plate is full, and I am not interested in serving as vice president. ” (For the record, Trump finds these expressions annoying. “They were never asked,” Trump told me. “I don’t like it when they do that, because it’s very dishonest. If they’ve taken themselves out, it means they’re not being asked. ”) There is a distinct sense among leading Republicans that if you take proper precautions  —      —   it’s possible to avoid contagion. Ryan agreed to be interviewed for a Father’s Day feature in People Magazine but only on the condition that no Trump questions be asked. Trump seems to fundamentally welcome the party’s revulsion. As Ryan wavered over supporting him, Trump was privately saying that Ryan’s rejection might actually help him, that he was just the kind of political lifer whom Trump positioned his campaign against. His   director (and a former caddie) Dan Scavino Jr. actually went public with this, tweeting out a link to a column in Breitbart headlined, “Paul Ryan Is the Reason the G. O. P. Is Losing America. ” While Ryan is trying to refashion and sell the G. O. P. as a party of innovation and heart, Trump is a creature of mouth and gut and other   drivers. They can try to operate in parallel G. O. P. universes, but the two styles are often in obvious conflict. On the sunny morning of June 7 in Washington, Ryan and a group of seven House colleagues visited the mostly black neighborhood Anacostia to highlight a central idea of Ryan’s agenda. After a meeting at a residential   center, the representatives took turns giving testimonials on why Republican policies  —   lower taxes, entitlement reform, less regulation  —   would better address the intractable problems of urban poverty. This was Ryan at his most earnest and  . His concern for the urban poor derives heavily from his intellectual mentor, Jack Kemp, the former Republican congressman, housing secretary and patron saint of     conservatism. Poverty is the first item of Ryan’s   policy plan. He spoke at a lectern, surrounded by community leaders, and then invited questions from the press. Did Ryan have any regrets about endorsing Trump? “I told you,” Ryan said, smiling, turning to one of his hosts. The first six or so questions were about Trump. He was then in the midst of a furor over his repeated claims that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the   jurist presiding in a civil case against Trump University, could not rule fairly because he was “Mexican. ” Ryan was blunt on the Curiel matter. “Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,” he said. That was the headline. Ryan expressed great frustration that such comments by Trump “undercut these things,” meaning this   event. When we spoke, Ryan was most eager to discuss Priebus, his old friend and fellow Wisconsinite. Along with the   governor, Scott Walker, the trio form a formidable G. O. P. axis of cheese heads. I asked Ryan how he, as the   elected Republican, would distinguish his mission as a party leader from Priebus’s. “I see my role as helping to define the standard, which are the issues,” Ryan told me. Priebus’s role is building the party’s apparatus to be ready for the  . “Reince is basically being the adult in calming the situation,” he added. “He is protecting that   process. Reince is protecting that from being disfigured or hijacked. ” Ryan views himself as a guardian of conservative “ideas. ” “Ideas” is one of those fetish words, popular among ambitious young pols (conservative   are constantly dropping Kemp’s name). As the speaker of the Florida House, Rubio published a book in 2006 of “100 innovative ideas” and spoke about his love of ideas during his presidential campaign, before he started making   jokes about Trump. Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor who was then considered one of the   innovators of the party, warned after Romney’s defeat in 2012 that the G. O. P. must stop being “the stupid party” and urged fellow Republicans to talk “like adults” and swear off “offensive and bizarre” rhetoric. He then embarked on a presidential campaign in which his most memorable “idea” was suggesting that Trump “looks like he’s got a squirrel sitting on his head. ” (Jindal dropped out in November Trump barely bothered to insult him.) Jindal’s “stupid party” remark reflected a concern among idea conservatives that was marinating well before Trump came along: that the Republican Party has taken on an increasingly   bent. There has been a strong populist allergy to elitism within the G. O. P. coalition for a long time. But Sarah Palin’s emergence as the   nominee in 2008 and subsequent tenure as a party celebrity was a benchmark. Lesser imitators like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain took turns as Republican   in 2012. Trump made his name as a national political figure in 2011 and 2012 with his flamboyant campaign to prove that Obama was not born in the United States, an   notion that was especially offensive to  . Four years later, the leader of what many Republicans had hoped was a nativist fringe movement is the party’s presumed nominee. Ryan believed that he and fellow   in Congress could preserve the party’s substantive core. This would be the laboratory from which he could remake the party’s conservative identity while attracting new Republicans, including young and minority voters. “I have to protect conservatism from being disfigured,” Ryan told me. His focus, he said, is on “ideas, temperament and the future of conservatism. ” Ryan has little confidence that Trump cares at all about his ideas, possessed that temperament or had thought at all about the future of conservatism. Trump almost never talks about “ideas,” unless you count blustery promises to “build a wall and make Mexico pay for it,” end lousy trade deals and “win” again. When, after considerable public hesitation, Ryan finally did say he would “vote for” Trump, he wrote a column in a newspaper in Janesville, Wis. reiterating his view that “politics can be a battle of ideas, not insults” and that “if we’re going to unite, it has to be over ideas. ” He said he had become convinced that Trump “would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws. ” What Trump had going for him more than anything, in Ryan’s eyes, was his willingness to outsource the conservative “idea” architecture of his administration to Ryan and   Republicans in the same way that he’s farming out much of his   campaign to the R. N. C. Even so, there’s no avoiding that Trump has over the last year been the ubiquitous voice of the G. O. P. to most voters, many of them new ones. He can cut a problematic image, to say the least. (In a June 15 Bloomberg poll, just 32 percent of Americans view the Republican Party favorably, the lowest figure since the survey’s 2009 inception.) Priebus and Ryan were relatively powerless during the primaries as Trump undertook his systematic disfiguring of the R. N. C. ’s plans for a more inclusive party. Last summer, during the relatively innocent months of Trump’s campaign, Priebus called and urged him to tone down his remarks (about “Mexican rapists,” for example). Trump scoffed at the idea that such a puny figure, a party guy, would ever try such a thing. “We’re not dealing with a   Army general,” Trump said. Priebus paid a debasing house call to Trump Tower last fall to accompany Trump as he signed a loyalty pledge to the eventual nominee. He listened this spring to Trump predict “riots” in Cleveland and complain about the “rigged” system that might deny him his rightful nomination. (“Give us all a break,” Priebus tweeted at one point.) He has endured an outpouring from a gallery of   who are urging the R. N. C. to take extraordinary measures and disavow its extraordinary nominee. “If Priebus ends up blessing the Trump nomination,” wrote the Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson, the head White House speechwriter for George W. Bush, “it would turn the sins of Trump into the sins of the G. O. P. And Priebus would go down as the head of the party who squandered the legacy of Lincoln, the legacy of Reagan, in a squalid and hopeless political effort. ” Priebus is not a man for extraordinary measures. He is an organization man in a time of disruption, runaway   and selfie campaigns. Party guys go along. It’s not always a fair fight. Political parties have seen better days in America. They are like many big and traditional institutions that way: the government, the church, among others. Signing on with the Donkeys and Elephants would seem a tired construct in a disintermediated culture of free agents and personal brand customization. Identities have replaced affiliations. In the course of reporting this article, I asked many Republicans of varied perspective why a young person today should consider joining a major political party. The question elicited sighs and head shakes, as if I were asking them why a millennial would join a Kiwanis Club, except that Kiwanis Clubs aren’t actively being resisted the way the Democratic and Republican parties are. Based on data from a 2014 Pew survey, 39 percent of the electorate identify as independents, compared with 32 percent as Democrats and 23 percent as Republicans (that’s the highest proportion of independents in nearly eight decades of surveys despite the fact that the country remains heavily partisan). It’s certainly worth pointing out that people have been predicting the death of the   system in America for years and also the demise of individual parties at various low points. The G. O. P. was supposedly terminal after Barry Goldwater’s landslide defeat of 1964, as were the Democrats following the rout of George McGovern in 1972 each party came back to win the White House four years later. Priebus, not surprisingly, is a defender of the party status quo. “The reality is, there’s two doors that people can walk through in this country,” he told me. “It’s not Italy. We don’t have 12 different parties where everyone can fit into their exact box. ” Still, the culture and speed of technological change has fueled an accelerated shift in how voters engage with and perceive political institutions and politicians. When I asked Trump the “why join a party?” question, he said, “I think the whole system is changing. ” His toggling between parties over the years has been well documented. Likewise, his embrace of atypical Republican positions during the primaries  —   his support for some aspects of Planned Parenthood  —   did nothing to thwart his nomination. It would indicate that voters might not be as wedded to the assumed conservative orthodoxies as G. O. P. leaders might think. “You have people who are socially conservative and fiscally nonconservative and vice versa,” Trump told me. “You have so many different permutations now. ” Trump’s embrace of this à la carte approach comports to a sensibility of voters’ choosing between models of disruption rather than a singular ideology. In a sense, disruption in and of itself has become an ideology. Whoever swings the biggest wrecking ball wins. “Washington is so broken and needs to be disrupted, and a lot of what could happen in this disruption would be good,” said Ben Sasse, a freshman Republican senator from Nebraska. “Unfortunately, it has to be someone who takes seriously the stewarding of a whole nation. And who cares about facts. And who is trustworthy. ” Sasse was pointedly not talking about Trump. He has said that he could not support him as his party nominee. He would not be voting for Clinton either. “There are Dumpster fires in my town more popular than these two ‘leaders,’’u2009” he wrote in a Facebook post in which he predicted the imminent breakup of both parties. He was harsher on Trump. Everywhere he goes in Nebraska, Sasse told me, people ask him for advice. “People say: ‘I’m distraught. I’m opposed to everything Hillary Clinton stands for, and yet I think I have to vote for her. How do you make sense of this? What should I do? ’’u2009” he said. “These are young evangelical women, teary sometimes. They say, ‘I can never tell my kids I voted for that man. ’’u2009” Sasse, who is 44, became an instant luminary of the   Never Trump movement after he unloaded on Trump. He is mostly avoiding interviews, though in a classic bit of politician   took this as an opportunity to share with me that “I’ve turned down something like 45 Sunday shows in a row. ” I asked Sasse if America’s fascination with celebrity might help explain the rise of Trump. No, he said. “There is such crisis of shared vision for what America means right now,” Sasse, a   former college president and business consultant, said. “People desperately seek shallower pop culture as a form of escape rather than finding actual meaning. ” For politics to be satisfying, it requires deeper ideals. And to partake of it as just another celebrity snack food leads a citizen to feel, after a while, “like you’ve eaten a   of cotton candy. ” In a tweet from early May, Sasse tried to nudge the former senator Tom Coburn into making a   bid. Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and   physician, left the Senate in 2015 after spending his career  —   six years in the House, 10 in the Senate  —   as one of Washington’s proudest conservative mavericks and procedural troublemakers. Sasse told me that Coburn is one of his political idols. He also mentioned Paul Ryan. “If Tom Coburn and Paul Ryan have a baby,” Sasse said, “I’m their hideous offspring. ” All things being equal, Coburn would welcome having a superdisrupter in Washington. He has never been a party guy. “I don’t think it really matters, the parties,” Coburn, now retired and living in Tulsa, said. But Trump has been “repulsive to me,” he said, adding that Trump’s ability to win a party nomination “kind of fits with the modern social decline of America. ” I asked Coburn what Trump’s nomination signaled about the state of G. O. P. He was characteristically glib, apocalyptic and idealistic. “Either Trump is going to totally destroy the Republican Party,” Coburn said. “Or in the aftermath of him possibly losing an election, we’re going to rebuild it stronger than ever. ” The    option is predicated on Trump’s losing. Several Republicans I spoke to seemed to hope for this, if not explicitly. It is politically fraught, obviously, to say they will not support their party’s presidential nominee. But based on my discussions, I’m willing to bet a good portion of the elected Republicans who claim minimal allegiance to “the nominee” will wind up voting for Clinton in the privacy of their voting booths while rooting for Trump’s complete humiliation. “We’re just going to have to swallow it,” said Mark Salter, the longtime chief of staff and confidant of John McCain. “He’s just unfit for the office,” referring to Trump. As for Clinton, he said, “I mean, the worst thing you can say about her is, she’s kind of a hack. ” Ed Rogers, a Republican lobbyist and veteran of the Reagan and George H. W. Bush White Houses, calls himself a “not yet Republican,” meaning he is “not yet” ready to support Trump and has in fact moved in the opposite direction since Trump clinched the nomination last month. Rogers, a longtime business partner of the former Mississippi governor and R. N. C. chairman Haley Barbour, acknowledged that the Republicans tend to exaggerate Clinton’s flaws as a trade prerogative. “The Clintons have never been the demons ideologically that we’ve made them out to be,” Rogers told me. “From a character standpoint, they’re pretty bad, but Hillary isn’t the frightening offensive character that Trump is. ” If   Republicans rebelled against the “establishment” in the primaries, Trump has provided the establishment with mounting ammunition to fight back in the 11th hour. The first half of June has been a running train wreck for Trump, beginning with his crusade against Judge Curiel. Trump has been provoking increasing alarm among Republicans at the moment he should be proving himself nominally “presidential. ” The Republican senator Mark Kirk of Illinois announced that he could no longer support Trump in the aftermath of Curiel (“I think he’s too bigoted and racist for the Land of Lincoln”) Lindsey Graham did the same and urged other Republicans backing Trump to rescind their endorsements. Top Republicans voiced widespread opposition   to Trump’s reiterated calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump in turn called party leaders “weak” and pounded them for not falling in line behind him. “Just please be quiet, don’t talk,” he railed at them at a June 15 rally in Atlanta. “We have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me do it by myself,” Trump said. “I’ll do very well. ” He would be banking on the   system being sufficiently hobbled that allegiance to him would prevail over partisan loyalty. Republicans wouldn’t hold it against Trump that he’s anathema to their establishment while Democrats would feel no loyalty to their traditional home team, let alone to Hillary Clinton. Trump appeared at this moment prepared to begin an independent   campaign under the nominal banner of the Republican Party, while using their abundant resources. This looked more like a jail break than a pivot. The second week of June was shaping up as another one of those “Baileys in my cereal” stretches for Reince Priebus. We were two days past the mass shooting in Orlando, a horrific event that moved Trump to tweet immediate thanks to all those who sent him “congrats” for predicting it. He also called on Obama to resign and later seemed to suggest that the president might have even been complicit in the tragedy. This invited swift repudiations from Republicans and Democrats, including a furious Obama, whose presidential stature seems to grow the longer Trump dominates news cycles. Obama’s net   rating has risen nearly 20 points since Trump became the G. O. P.   and the party’s inescapable face last summer. Priebus spent the weekend in Utah at an annual “ideas” gathering that Mitt Romney hosts for Republican luminaries, donors and business leaders. In a normal year, this would serve as a Republican unity confab before the convention: party bonding in the mountains. But this year’s edition was more of a rock slide. It convened a huddle of the Never Trumps, disaffected    and increasingly skittish party notables like Ryan and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. Romney set the tone for the weekend when he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN that Trump in the White House could “change the character of the generations of Americans that are following” and might result in “  racism,” “  misogyny” and “  bigotry. ” In a    session with Ryan, the   chief executive Meg Whitman, who was the G. O. P. nominee for governor of California in 2010, questioned how Ryan could endorse such an appalling figure. She placed Trump in the company of Hitler and Mussolini. Romney appeared to tear up at one point, according to an account in Politico. “Seeing this just breaks your heart,” he said. Priebus played the good party soldier. “Respect Mitt and differences but couldn’t disagree more,” he tweeted at Romney after his remarks. “Let’s stop this and unify. ” Priebus told Trump opponents at the retreat that Trump would win “with or without their help. ” He conveyed the exasperation of a substitute teacher being pelted with flying erasers. In almost every visit, Priebus and I had engaged in some variation on the same discussion. I kept asking him: “Whose party is this anyway? Who gets to define the G. O. P. ?” “It’s the party’s party,” he always answered. “The party defines the party. ” Convention delegates write the platform that lays out the party’s tenets. Trump can’t really change those: It’s a common refrain these days among   Republicans. “Trump is not going to change the institution,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, told Politico last month, referring to the G. O. P. “He’s not going to change the basic philosophy of the party. ” Priebus and others might try to shape Trump’s behavior. They talk every day, Priebus and Trump. And tens of millions of people are having their impressions formed, shaped or solidified about today’s Republican Party by watching Donald Trump. They will vote for or against him in droves, not based on anything they read in the platform, whose readership probably amounts to less than 1 percent of Trump’s Twitter following. As I waited for Priebus in the lobby of the R. N. C. I noticed a tweet from an Associated Press reporter saying that Lamar Alexander, a Republican senator, had just suggested Trump might not be the surefire nominee after all. “We do not have a nominee until after the convention,” Alexander said. “That’s what you say,” Alexander added in response to a reminder that Trump was in fact the “presumptive nominee. ” It would seem ridiculously late in the process to be haggling over modifiers, at least it would be in a mythical normal year. When I walked into Priebus’s office, he sat on his couch and soldiered forth like a good party guy. If Ryan and McConnell tried to remain boxed off from the earthquake, Priebus occupied another shelter, constructed of   armor, alternate reality and denial. “I’m feeling good about things,” Priebus told me. His voice was flat and deliberate,   mode. It was hard to resist a few pokes at the organization man. How’s that Trump pivot working out? “I think it’s a work in progress,” Priebus said. He was trying to be upbeat. “I have Hillary Clinton on the other side,” he said, clinging to her as a lifeline. He was hoarse. I noticed him fiddling with a drink coaster. The coaster bore a cartoon rendition, sure enough, of Donald Trump: the only physical likeness I noticed anywhere in the building. Priebus had swiped a couple of these coasters from the bar at the   Hotel and found them amusing. He set them on a side table in his office, next to the fish tank. He predicted that Clinton’s campaign would be a “race to the bottom. ” Well, yes. There’s nothing like claims of moral high ground on a campaign. But I couldn’t help reminding Priebus that Trump recently accused President Bill Clinton of rape, Obama of treason, Hillary Clinton of murdering Vince Foster, Cruz’s dad of associating with assassins, Romney of not being a “real” Mormon and the rest of the litany. Where did the bottom even begin, and where could it possibly end? Priebus said that the rape and Vince Foster things were “sort of just warning shots to the Hillary campaign. ” He also claimed that Trump and Clinton were running “tied in the polls,” though this was being contradicted as we spoke. Clinton led Trump by 12 points in a new Bloomberg survey, with 55 percent of respondents saying they would never vote for the Republican and in an ABC   Post poll, seven in 10 Americans viewed Trump unfavorably, up 10 points in just the last month. A few days earlier, the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said that Republicans’ accepting Trump as the nominee was “like ignoring Stage IV cancer. ” There was a new wave of “Dump Trump” stories in the media, mostly featuring the same band of   Never Trumpers who seem to spend vast amounts of time on Twitter. I asked Priebus about any convention situation that could deny Trump the nomination. He did not reject the possibility, but it’s remote. It would require an alternative candidate (none currently) an organizing effort and a confluence of highly unlikely rule changes, delegate votes and procedural   whose likelihood Priebus compared to drawing an inside straight three times in a row. “I think people are living in Fantasy Land,” he said, not saying whether he shared in the fantasy. Priebus was heading out to catch a flight to Greensboro, N. C. for a   event with Trump that night. He was playing a role, the party guy, the proprietor of the china shop in the time of the bull. There was something oddly comforting to me about this presence, as thankless and unenviable as the life of Priebus might seem these days. What could be better for a lifer apparatchik? Priebus made a perfect   foil to a new politics of blazing chaos. “It could be a great moment or a bad moment,” Priebus told me. “But it’s going to be a moment. ” I thanked Priebus for his time. He was still fumbling with the cartoon Donald Trump coasters. “Your party’s made this story fun for me,” I told him. “Have I made it fun?” he asked, almost plaintively. “Or have I made it less fun?”</td>\n",

       "        <td>In recent years, one of the most important events on a prospective Republican presidential candidate’s calendar was the RedState Gathering, a summer convention for conservative activists from across the nation. Its host was Erick Erickson, a   redheaded former election lawyer and city councilman in Macon, Ga. who began blogging in 2004 on a site called RedState. com. Erickson, who is now 41, is a conservative absolutist who made his name in the   by “blowing up”  —   in the Twitter parlance he jovially employs  —   Republican leaders he viewed as insufficiently principled. In 2005, he played a role in torpedoing the Supreme Court nomination of the White House counsel Harriet Miers, publishing damaging admissions from White House sources that Miers had not been properly vetted. Five years later, he chided the National Rifle Association for being too willing to compromise, labeling it “a weak little girl of an organization. ” He was a   critic of John McCain and Mitt Romney during their presidential runs, characterizing the former as “an angry old jackass” and the latter as “the Harriet Miers of 2012. ” Along the way, Erickson became one of the new kingmakers of the Tea   G. O. P. A   Florida legislator and Senate hopeful named Marco Rubio reached out to him in 2009 when he was at 3 percent in the polls. A former Texas solicitor general, Ted Cruz, did the same in 2011. Rick Perry announced his 2012 presidential candidacy at Erickson’s gathering. By 2015, a number of the coming cycle’s aspirants  —   Rubio, Cruz, Perry and Bobby Jindal  —   had given him their personal cellphone numbers, and he had traded emails with Jeb Bush. And two months before that August’s convention in Atlanta, a New   Republican consultant named Sam Nunberg reached out to Erickson to ask if he could accommodate one more speaker: Donald Trump. Erickson watched coverage of Trump’s    announcement at Trump Tower on June 16 and was not particularly impressed. On the syndicated radio show he broadcasts from Atlanta, he offered his assessment with a dismissive chuckle: “I guess he’s ready to be spoiler, not president. ” He had met Trump once before, in July 2011, when he visited the 26th floor of Trump Tower to interview the businessman and    star. Trump had spent the past few months flirting with a presidential run only to decide, as he told Erickson that day, “I have a great show that’s a big success, and it’s hard to say, ‘I’m gonna leave two hours of   television in order to get beat up by people that don’t know what they’re doing. ’’u2009” The hourlong conversation struck Erickson as pleasant but unmemorable. What did stick with him was their exchange as he was leaving Trump Tower. “Trump asked me if I played golf,” Erickson told me recently. “And I said, ‘Yeah, I’m terrible. ’’u2009” Then, he said, Trump asked if he would be interested in coming to Trump’s   in West Palm Beach, Fla. to play. “I’m very flattered  —   I’ve never been to West Palm Beach before,” Erickson recalled. “Several times, his office reached out. So finally I asked my wife, ‘What do you think this is about?’ She said, ‘He wants to own your soul.’ So I never went. ” Erickson did not see much of a political future for Trump, but he imagined that he might be good for ticket sales, if nothing else, at the RedState Gathering. He informed Nunberg that Trump could have a slot on the convention’s second day. The evening before he was to speak in Atlanta, Trump went on CNN and denounced the Fox News host Megyn Kelly for her sharp questioning of him during a recent debate, speculating that Kelly had “blood coming out of her wherever. ” When Erickson saw the footage that evening, he called Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and rescinded Trump’s invitation on the grounds that he would be too much of a distraction. “And that was that,” Erickson would later recall with a sheepish grin. “Until the next day, when he’s blowing me up. ” On Twitter, Trump called Erickson “a major sleaze and buffoon” and said that the “small crowds” at the gathering were due to his absence. Trump’s supporters soon piled on. This was to be expected, but what surprised Erickson were the attacks from people he regarded as his fellow   in the conservative revolution. On Twitter, the   host and Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham mocked “JebState. ” The author and   provocateur Ann Coulter brought up some of Erickson’s own crass utterances, like his characterization of the former Supreme Court justice David Souter in 2009 as a “ [expletive] child molester. ” The next week, 30, 000 readers of Erickson’s email newsletter canceled their subscriptions. Erickson dug in, writing that Trump was “out of his depth” and lacking in “common decency. ” But he was drowned out by Trump sympathizers with even bigger audiences than his own, like The Drudge Report and the online outlet Breitbart. It was one of the first salvos in what would open up in the year that followed into a civil war within the conservative media, dividing some of the loudest voices on the right. Days earlier, Erickson had unimpeachable credentials in the conservative movement. But by crossing Trump, he was now, in the eyes of his former allies, “a tool of the establishment. ” The conservative media has always been a playground for outsize personalities with even more outsize political ambitions. The National Review founder William F. Buckley fashioned much of the intellectual genetic code of the Reagan Revolution, while also writing fringe groups like the John Birch Society out of the conservative movement and, for good measure, running for mayor of New York against the liberal Republican John Lindsay. In 1996, the former Nixon media consultant Roger Ailes brought his   ethos to Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News channel and built the network into a transformational power in Republican politics before his fall this year amid accusations of sexual harassment. But alongside the   like Buckley and Ailes, the   landscape has also produced a class of rowdy entrepreneurs who wield their influence in more personal, protean ways. The godfathers mostly came to power in the 1990s:   antagonists like Rush Limbaugh, who began broadcasting nationally in 1988 and became talk radio’s hegemonic power in the Clinton years, and Matt Drudge, who started his pioneering Drudge Report online in 1996. If these figures defied the stuffy ceremony of the East Coast think tanks, opinion journals and   columnists who traditionally defined the conservative intelligentsia, they rarely challenged the ideological principles of conservatism as they had existed since the Reagan era: small government, low taxes, hawkish foreign policy and traditional social values. What they mostly did was provide the Republican Party with a set of exceptionally loud megaphones, which liberals have often envied and tried unsuccessfully to emulate. Conservative talk radio and Fox News now collectively reach an audience of as many as 50 million  —   most of them elderly white Republicans with a high likelihood of turning out in election years. And this isn’t even counting the   online outlets that have flourished during the Obama years, thanks to a growing   economy and a presidency, particularly in the case of the Affordable Care Act, that gave conservatives common cause. Then came Trump. In a sense, the divide that he has opened up among conservative media figures is simply a function of the heartburn his ascent has caused among Republicans more generally, pitting voter against voter, congressman against congressman, Bob Dole against the Bushes. Some conservative media outlets threw themselves behind Trump from the beginning, explaining away his more radioactive statements and his    record as a conservative. Breitbart, whose former chairman, Steve Bannon, is now Trump’s chief strategist, was an ardent early supporter, breathlessly covering Trump’s ascent in the polls and his smackdowns of “low energy” Jeb Bush and “little Marco” Rubio. But as Trump expanded into more sacrosanct targets  —   Fox News’s Kelly, George W. Bush’s performance in the war on terror and Cruz  —   the dissenting chorus among conservatism’s dons grew louder. The Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer warned in December that Trump “has managed to steer the entire G. O. P. campaign into absurdities. ” His Post colleague George Will predicted that a Trump nomination would mean the loss of conservatism “as a constant presence in U. S. politics. ” The Weekly Standard editor William Kristol floated the idea of a new “    party. ” And on the eve of the Iowa caucus, National Review devoted an entire issue to a single topic: “Against Trump. ” Since Trump clinched the nomination, the dividing lines have become starker, the individual dilemmas more agonizing. Mark Levin, an influential   host, complains that among conservative commentators, Trump’s message is endlessly repeated by what he derisively refers to as “the Rockettes. ” But Levin, too, recently announced to his listeners that he intends to vote for Trump, if only to prevent another Clinton presidency. As he put it to me, “I’m not going to be throwing confetti in the air if Trump wins,” adding that he viewed the candidate as “a liberal with some conservative viewpoints that he’s not terribly reliable at sticking to. ” Others  —   Sean Hannity, Ingraham, the former Reagan official and “The Book of Virtues” author William Bennett  —   have thrown in for Trump with a brio that strikes some in the business as unseemly. “Look, we’re in the opinion business, but there’s a distinction between that and being a Sean Hannity fanboy,” the     host Charlie Sykes told me. “It’s been genuinely stunning to watch how they’ve become tools of his campaign and rationalizing everything he’s done. ” “For 20 years I’ve been saying how it’s not true that talk radio is all about ratings and we don’t believe what we say,” he went on. “Then you watch how the media types rolled over for him. Obviously Donald Trump is very good for ratings, and at some point it’s hard not to conclude they decided the Trump train was the gravy train. I’ve been thoroughly disillusioned, and I’m not alone in that. It’s like watching ‘Invasion of the Body Snatchers’: Oh, my God, they got another one!” When Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, the part of his announcement speech that most clearly foreshadowed the campaign to come had to do with immigration. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he told the crowd at Trump Tower. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. ” The line struck Sykes as awfully familiar when he heard it. A month before, he had run a segment with Ann Coulter, who had just published her 11th book, an   screed titled “¡Adios, America!” Sykes was well aware of Coulter’s views, but he was taken aback when she began a riff on Mexican rapists surging into the United States (a subject that takes up an entire chapter of “¡Adios, America! ”). “I remember looking at my producer and going, ‘Wow, this is rather extraordinary,’’u2009” he told me. “When Trump used that line, I instantly recognized it as Ann Coulter’s. ” In fact, Corey Lewandowski had reached out to Coulter for advice in the   to Trump’s announcement speech. The address Trump delivered on June 16 bore no resemblance to his prepared text, which contained a mere two sentences about immigration. Instead, he   what Coulter today calls “the Mexican rapist speech that won my heart. ” When Trump’s remarks provoked fury, Lewandowski called Coulter for backup. Three days later, she went on HBO’s “Real Time With Bill Maher” and, amid shrieks of laughter from the audience, predicted that Trump was the Republican candidate most likely to win the presidency. One evening this past March, Trump received Coulter at    his    in Palm Beach. Though in recent years the two had developed a rapport on Twitter, she had met him face to face only once before he declared his candidacy, a lunch date at Trump Tower in 2011. Over lunch, Trump gave Coulter the impression that he had read her books. He also gave her a few items from his wife’s line of costume jewelry and told Coulter, who keeps a house in Palm Beach, that she was welcome to use the pool at    anytime. The golf resort was the chief staging ground for Trump’s charm offensives against the conservative media. Many of its members have visited at Trump’s invitation in recent years, joining the resident Gatsby for steak and lobster on the patio, where Trump squints and appears to listen intently while his guests dispense political wisdom  —   though it is never clear whether he is actually interested in it, simply flattering his guests or sizing them up. When I dined with him on the patio this spring, Trump asked me eagerly about how I liked his odds in the election. Later, on the campaign trail, I watched him solicit the same counsel from random stragglers on the rope line. Coulter, at any rate, appeared immune to the whole routine. A week earlier, Trump bragged during a Republican presidential debate in Detroit that “there’s no problem” with the size of his penis. On the patio, Coulter told the candidate that no one wanted to hear about his endowment. She told Lewandowski that he should buy a dozen teleprompters and put them in every room of Trump’s house until he learned how to use them. Reminding Trump that she had been his earliest and most dedicated advocate, she told him: “I’m the only one losing money trying to put you in the White House. You’re going to listen to me. ” This appeal to the bottom line seemed to tweak Trump’s conscience. He gave Coulter an open invitation to    waiving the $100, 000 membership fee. The following evening at the next Republican debate, he exhibited considerably more restraint, for which Coulter, with characteristic modesty, claims credit. “Coulter delivers!” she told me. Some of Trump’s supporters within the conservative media are attracted to his actual positions on issues. One is his trade policy, on which many media personalities on the right are considerably more populist and protectionist than Republican Party leaders and Chamber of Commerce boosters. Throughout Obama’s presidency, Laura Ingraham has warned of China’s predations: “The trade war is on, and we’re losing it,” she has often said. For others, Trump’s assurance that he will appoint Antonin   conservatives to the Supreme Court is reason enough for their support. But Trump also simply fulfills the ineffable urge many have to, as Michael Needham, the chief executive of the conservative policy group Heritage Action for America, puts it, “punch Washington in the face. ” This is true for Coulter, who, in her newly published paean to the candidate, “In Trump We Trust,” writes that Trump is fit for the presidency not in spite of his crudeness but because of it: “Only someone who brags about his airline’s seatbelt buckles being made of solid gold would have the balls to do what Trump is doing. ” But what really sold Coulter on Trump, she told me, was his hard line on immigration. Coulter told me that she had never given the issue much thought during her childhood in New Canaan, Conn. and her student days at Cornell. Then in 1992, the   journalist Peter Brimelow wrote a   essay for National Review titled “Time to Rethink Immigration?” which would later become a sort of   for today’s   the ascendant   movement that has found its champion in Trump. Brimelow cast the current wave of American immigrants in dismal terms: less skilled, less European, less assimilated, less   and less Republican than the previous newcomers. Coulter, who was 31 and a law clerk at the time, remembers reading it and thinking, “Oh, my gosh, I’ve been completely lied to!”   years later, Coulter helped formulate Trump’s   position, which she hailed on Twitter as “the greatest political document since the Magna Carta. ” (Her additional tweet on the subject  —   “I don’t care if @realDonaldTrump wants to perform abortions in the White House after this immigration policy paper”  —   prompted Mark Levin to tweet back, “These have to be among the most pathetic comments of anyone in a long time. ”) Coulter has not always gotten her way with the candidate. At    that evening in March, she lobbied unsuccessfully for him to pick as his running mate Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, who is credited with selling Mitt Romney on “ . ” And her book tour for “In Trump We Trust” hit a momentary snag when Trump told Sean Hannity that he would be open to “softening” his immigration stance, though Coulter chose to believe that, as she told me, “it was Hannity badgering him. ” Still, she has become the Trump campaign’s most unrepentant brawler. When Khzir Khan, the   father of a U. S. Army captain who was killed in combat in Iraq, spoke critically of Trump at the Democratic National Convention, Coulter wrote on Twitter: “You know what this convention really needed: An angry Muslim with a thick accent like Fareed Zacaria[sic]. ” That tweet provoked disgust from fellow conservatives, among them Erick Erickson, who tweeted: “What a terrible thing to say about a man whose son died for this country. ” When I reminded Coulter of Erickson’s scolding, she let out a hearty laugh. “I always hated him,” she said. “This is one of the fantastic things. In any political movement, there are many people you think are losers and dorks, but your friends talk you into liking them, because they’re on our side. Now all of those people are out. ” Sighing, she said, “Trump has made my life better in so many ways. ” You will not find copies of “¡Adios, America!” or “In Trump We Trust” on any of the many bookshelves in the home of the Washington Post columnist George Will. A week after Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican presidential race in early May, Will and his wife, Mari, a Republican political consultant, gave a catered dinner party for Cruz and his wife, Heidi. The other guests were conservative donors, activists and journalists, along with their spouses. The Wills have been hosting these    encounters with political celebrities at their Maryland home for decades. In early 2009, Will’s fellow conservative columnists gathered there to meet Obama a week before his inauguration. Among the guests that evening in May was Laura Ingraham. Ingraham is of proudly   heritage  —   her mother was a waitress for almost 30 years and her father owned and operated a    carwash  —   and does not share Will’s reverence for decorum. She was an early defender of Trump’s willingness to say things “no one else is saying. ” While interviewing Cruz on her radio show six weeks before the Wills’ party, she interrupted him to mock his Harvard Law degree. Still, Cruz knew that his political future relied on conservative   like Ingraham, and it was at his request that the Wills included her in the party. Over cocktails, the Cruzes spoke fondly of their experiences on the campaign trail, and the other guests listened politely, mindful of Cruz’s recent humiliating defeat. Then midway through dinner, at a table set with glasses once used by Abraham Lincoln, Ingraham insisted that Cruz needed to throw his weight behind the man who had branded him “Lyin’ Ted. ” “If you don’t endorse him, where does that leave you?” she said. “You don’t have the public and you don’t have the establishment. How can you be a leader of the conservative movement?” Cruz amiably replied that such a decision did not have to be made right away. Others at the table joined in to defend him, but Ingraham would hear nothing of it. “You can’t want Hillary Clinton elected,” she goaded him. Will sat fuming silently. “She was quite animated,” he would later recall. Cruz refused to offer his support to Trump that night or in the weeks to follow. Speaking at the Republican convention on July 20 moments before Cruz was to do the same, Ingraham taunted him: “We should all, even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos  —   and we love you, we love you  —   but you must honor the pledge to support Donald Trump now, tonight!” The following morning on her radio show, Ingraham declared that Cruz’s refusal to endorse had “effectively ended his political career. ” Will was no more persuaded by Ingraham than Cruz was. The first and only time Will met Trump was in March 1995, when, at Trump’s invitation, he gave a speech at   . Years later on Twitter, Trump would ascribe Will’s harsh view of him to Will’s having “totally bombed” with his performance that night. Will told me: “He started telling this story: ‘The reason Will doesn’t like me is I invited him to give a speech at    and I knew it was going to be boring, so I waited out on the patio.’ Which raises two questions. First, if he knew it was going to be that boring, why did he invite me? And second, who would be the guy with the orange hair sitting in the front row?” Will said on ABC’s “This Week” in 2012 that Trump was “a bloviating ignoramus” and he has spent much of the past year predicting the candidate’s imminent political demise. “I thought even an entertaining bore could be a bore after a while,” he told me. By late December of last year, however, his contempt had given way to alarm. “Conservatives’ highest priority,” he wrote in a Post column, “must be to prevent Trump from winning the Republican nomination”  —   even if it meant Hillary Clinton’s election. Then on June 2, three weeks after his dinner party for Cruz, Will learned that his friend and fellow Republican Paul Ryan, the House speaker, had endorsed the nominee. Will considered the matter over martinis at home that evening. The next morning, he walked into his office and told his assistant: “Go change my registration. This is not my party anymore. ” Recently I visited Will at his office, a   Georgetown brick rowhouse erected in 1811. Its walls are covered with framed photographs, several of them depicting the writer in his youth alongside Reagan and other titans of his former party. The dean of conservative pundits, now 75, wore a crisp pinstripe shirt and gray slacks, his customary owlish Mona Lisa expression a bit tighter than usual, owing to the subject matter. Will told me that he cast his first vote in 1964, for Barry Goldwater. He voted for the Republican candidate in every succeeding presidential election, until now. “I don’t use the word ‘frightening’ often,” he told me. “But it’s frightening to know this person”  —   Trump  —   “would have the   codes. The world is getting really dangerous. His friend Mr. Putin is dismantling a nation in the center of Europe. Some   captain of a Chinese boat with    missiles might make a mistake in the next three years near the Spratly Islands. All kinds of things can go wrong. And the idea that this guy will be asked to respond in a sober, firm way? My goodness. ” He seemed genuinely despondent. “Given that, could you see yourself urging your readers to vote for Hillary Clinton?” I asked. Will’s lips pursed slightly. “Well,” he said, “it’s clear from everything I’ve written that I think she’d be a better president. That said, I’m not going to vote for her. First of all, I’m a Maryland voter. She couldn’t lose Maryland if she tried. ” “Then. . .. ” “I haven’t decided,” he said. “You can imagine  —   I get tons of emails: ‘I, too, have left the Republican Party. What should I do?’ Well, there are a number of legitimate options. Not voting is a legitimate expression of opinion. ” Ingraham and other conservative media personalities hailed Trump for having “tapped into” a shared and seething disquiet among predominantly white,    voters. “What I don’t understand on the part of those being tapped into,” Will told me, “is: What exactly do they want? I can think of nothing the American people have wanted intensely and protractedly that they didn’t get. Took a while, but they got it. ” With a resigned   he looked at the ground and intoned, in the manner of a   monologue: “It’s gonna be yuge. And it’s all gonna get fixed. And we’re all gonna be winners. ” “If he doesn’t build that wall, I’m pissed,” Sean Hannity told me, reflecting on the prospects of a Trump presidency in the office of his radio show in Midtown Manhattan. “If he doesn’t repeal Obamacare, I’m gonna be pissed. If he appoints a liberal jurist to the Supreme Court, I’m gonna lose my mind. And by the way: I’ll be screaming. Not talking  —   screaming about it. But in fairness, if Trump doesn’t keep his promises, you can also blame me, because I believed him. ” Although Coulter was Trump’s earliest cheerleader among prominent   personalities, Hannity’s stake in the election perhaps runs deepest of all, if only because of the size of his audience. He hosts the    show (after Limbaugh) on talk radio and the    program (after Bill O’Reilly and Megyn Kelly) on cable news. More than 2. 4 million weekly viewers and 13 million listeners have witnessed Hannity sticking his neck out on behalf of a   politician and sometime Republican who has voiced support for Planned Parenthood while vowing to limit America’s military footprint and shred trade deals that the G. O. P. has backed for decades. Hannity’s critics on the right have accused him of essentially running hourlong daily Trump infomercials. When I asked him about this, Hannity responded with a   litany of sins perpetrated by the Republican establishment in concert with Obama: perilously low labor participation and homeownership rates, soaring national debt, Obamacare and so on. A Clinton presidency, he warned, would be “Obama on steroids. ” These were his motivations. “My conscience is clear. And I feel like Donald Trump would be a great president. ” Hannity told me that he had in fact never stayed at a Trump hotel property, played on a Trump golf course or visited   . “I have my own place  —   on the other Florida coast, in Naples,” he said. “I don’t need his place. I always got the sense people were asking him for something. I don’t believe in asking for free stuff. ” Nonetheless, the two men have a mutual affinity that has spanned at least two decades. The MSNBC “Morning Joe” host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough theorized to me that their relationship has a psychological underpinning: “Donald Trump, Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly all share the same resentment that they will never be accepted into Manhattan’s polite society no matter what they do. ” (Trump is from Queens Hannity and O’Reilly are from Long Island.) Trump, in a recent phone conversation, offered me a somewhat simpler explanation: “Sean likes having me on his show, and that has to do with ratings more than anything else. ” No presidential candidate in history, Hannity told me, understands television better than Trump  —   “not even close. ” On this score, I couldn’t disagree. One evening this past spring, on his plane after a campaign event in Buffalo, Trump told me that at rallies, he always made a point of finding the TV cameras at the back of the media pen and noticing whether a red light was flickering. “That means they’re airing it live,” he explained. “So I make sure to say something new”  —   by which he meant newsworthy, the better to own the next news cycle. Trump was a TV star for more than a decade before he became a politician he watches TV news incessantly and understands the medium intimately. He knows the optimal time slots on the morning shows. He   the   lighting. He is not only on speaking terms with every network chief executive but also knows their booking agents. He monitors the opinions of hosts and regular guests more avidly than most media critics do and works them obsessively, often directly. Scarborough told me that Trump’s family  —   particularly Ivanka Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner  —   sometimes asked him for advice, and more than once “called me and asked me to get him off the ledge. I’ve said, ‘I can do that, but six hours later he’s going to revert to form.’ I told Jared at one point: ‘Jared, your    listens to me more when I’m attacking him on television than when I’m trying to convince him to be rational for the sake of the party.’ I think he’s a creature of TV. ” TV networks, in the mainstream as well as conservative media, have profited handsomely from Trump’s   theatrics, but some of their   personalities like Hannity are drawn to him for reasons apart from ratings. The prospect of getting in on the ground floor of a Trump administration that is short on policy ideas and disdainful of old Washington hands amounts to a     opportunity. By employing the Breitbart publisher Steve Bannon, and by including both Ingraham and Roger Ailes in his debate preparations, Trump has implicitly encouraged the conservative media to consider itself part of the campaign team. I asked Hannity if it was true that, as a Trump confidant had told me, he wished to be considered as a potential Trump White House chief of staff. “That’s news to me,” he insisted, adding a politician’s practiced nondenial denial: “I have radio and TV contracts that I will honor through December 2020. ” Nonetheless, Hannity’s service to the Trump campaign well exceeds that of ritually bashing Clinton and giving Trump free airtime. He has offered private strategic advice to the campaign. The same Trump confidant told me of at least one instance in which Hannity drafted an unsolicited memo outlining the message Trump should offer after the Orlando nightclub shooting in June. In public, Hannity has made it his mission to warn fellow conservatives  —   naming names, like the columnist Jonah Goldberg and the National Review editor in chief Rich Lowry  —   that if they do not soon climb aboard the Trump train they will, as the hashtag threatens, #OwnIt: Clinton’s picks for the Supreme Court, her response to the Islamic State, her trade deals, all of it. Hannity maintains that his scolding of Trump’s conservative dissenters derives from his fear of a Clinton presidency. “It’d be pretty much over,” he said. Taken alone, George Will or even National Review might have little impact on Trump’s standing in the race, Hannity argued, but “cumulatively they do. I can look at the poll numbers. If you go back to a month ago, he was garnering 73 percent of the Republican vote. The most recent, I think he had 88 percent. He needs to get to 93. ” And the key to the last 5 percent might very well lie with the noisy holdouts, like Erick Erickson. On Sept. 16, Erickson showed up at the National Press Club in Washington to participate in a debate sponsored by the National Religious Broadcasters. Erickson left RedState at the end of last year to concentrate on his radio show and his online opinion journal, The Resurgent, but he has remained influential among conservatives who do not support Trump. In July, when he learned that Ted Cruz was about to have a private meeting with the nominee on the eve of the convention, Erickson texted the senator: “Don’t endorse! Don’t endorse!” Later that evening, Erickson says, Cruz texted back: “Didn’t endorse! Didn’t endorse!” (Cruz finally announced that he would vote for Trump on Sept. 23.) The subject of the debate, inevitably, was Trump: specifically, whether evangelical Christians should support him. Being a lifelong evangelical himself, Erickson had some thoughts on the matter. Over the years, he had been condemned for his own offensive words, like the time he called the Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis “Abortion Barbie. ” But he had recently apologized for many (though not all) of these statements and had called upon Trump to affect a similar posture of Christian humility. “1 Corinthians is very explicit,” he told me. “If someone holds one’s self out to be a Christian and doesn’t behave that way, Christians are supposed to judge him. This is a guy who’s bragged about his affairs. ” This was Erickson’s principal argument during the debate. Trump was not merely a sinner, he said, but a gleefully unrepentant one. Erickson’s debate opponent, the Christian   host and fervent Trump supporter Janet Parshall, responded by reciting a litany of sinners in chief  —   from Thomas Jefferson with the    child he fathered with a slave, to Warren G. Harding with his multiple liaisons, to Richard Nixon with his foul language memorialized on the White House tapes. “We are not electing a messiah,” Parshall said. “Last time I checked, he was appointed to office and he is not  . ” Erickson’s debating partner, the conservative activist Bill Wichterman, argued that Trump appealed to the worst in America: His bullying, his lying and his bigotry were “corrosive to our national character. ” Erickson could testify to this. At one point, he was receiving as many as 300 emails a day from Trump supporters. Some of them referred to him as a “cuck” or “ . ” The word  —   a   derivative of “cuckold”  —   was new to Erickson, as were its originators in the    . More than one of the emails predicted that Erickson would be shot to death. At the local grocery store, a man walked up to Erickson’s two young children “and told them they needed to know their father was destroying this country by supporting Hillary Clinton,” Erickson told me. And one evening, two people showed up on the Ericksons’ doorstep to deliver a threat  —   Erickson would not tell me what it was  —   explicit enough that he later hired security guards. “I’ve never had Obama or Romney or McCain or Clinton supporters come to my home or send me nasty letters,” he said. Did Trump beget all of this? If so, what begot Trump? Erickson argued that the fault lay with Beltway Republicans. “They’ve broken so many promises,” he said. “They promised to defund the president’s immigration plan. They promised to defund Obamacare. They promised to fight the president on raising the debt limit. At some point, the base of the party just wants to burn the house down and start over. ” But even Erickson did not seem convinced that this alone explained what he saw as a nihilistic turn among Republican voters. “I do think there are a lot of people that have just concluded that this is it  —   that if we don’t get the election right, the country’s over,” he said. As to where they might have gotten that idea, Erickson knew the answer. It was the apocalyptic hymn sung by   hosts like his friend and mentor Rush Limbaugh, whose show Erickson once   though in the time of Trump, it seemed unlikely he would receive another invitation. This February, Limbaugh, who has applauded Trump without endorsing him outright, posed to Erickson the question of whether a commentator should try to act as “the guardian of what it means to be a conservative. ” In effect, the legend of talk radio was laying down an unwritten commandment of the trade, which applies as well to cable TV: Do not attempt to lead your following. This was simple enough for an avowed Trump supporter like Ingraham. “Laura’s never missed an opportunity to build her career on the backs of others,” Erickson told me. He counted Hannity as another mentor and admired his entrepreneurial cunning, saying: “Sean reflects his audience. He’s not going to leave his audience. ” On his own radio show, Erickson found that the more he denounced Trump, the more female listeners he picked up. But most of the 300, 000 people who tuned in weekly during rush hour were men. While Erickson refused to abandon his principles, he did not wish to go broke, either. On Sept. 20, Erickson wrote a long post for The Resurgent titled “Reconsidering My Opposition to Donald Trump. ” He made no effort to disguise his moroseness. “I see the election of Hillary Clinton as the antithesis of all my values and ideas on what fosters sound civil society in this country,” he wrote, and described his manifold objections to her at great length. But, he went on, “I have to admit that while I may view Hillary Clinton’s campaign as   I view Donald Trump’s campaign as  . . .. While I see Clinton as having no virtue, I see Donald Trump corrupting the virtuous and fostering hatred, racism and dangerous strains of nationalism. ” The election left him adrift. “I am without a candidate. I just cannot vote for either one. ” And so Erickson’s conscience led him back to where he was 13 months ago. Nowadays, he told me, he was doing all he could to avoid discussing Trump and the election altogether  —   a tall order for a   host. Responding to my look of bewilderment, he said, “Why dwell on the train wreck?” Erickson believed he was not alone. “People know where we’re headed, don’t like where we’re headed and would rather talk about something else,” he said. Erickson had won many fights. This one was the biggest yet, and he had lost. There was nothing left to do but step back from his megaphone, dwell on happier matters and wait for the next righteous cause.</td>\n",

Indiana is effectively a closeout contest for Donald Trump, who can effectively all but end the GOP nominating contest by winning the lion’s share of the Hoosier State’s 57 delegates with a resounding victory.  On the left, Hillary Clinton lowered expectations by largely bypassing the state to focus on West Virginia. A Sanders win in Indiana will not change anything for Democrats since Sanders and Clinton will probably split the state’s delegates, but a Clinton victory may put more pressure on Sanders to exit the race.

And it’s going to be America First. ” 9:22: Trump says “we’re going to bring back our jobs” and “we’re going to keep our jobs. ” Trump says companies can go to different states but not to other countries that devalue their currencies. He says there will be “serious consequences” for companies that do so. Trump says he has been in competitions all of his life and he has met some of the most unbelievable competitors in this election cycle. Trump says Cruz is “one hell of a competitor” and a “tough, smart guy. ” He adds that he doesn’t know whether Cruz likes him but says Cruz has “got an amazing future. ” He wants to congratulate Cruz and realizes how tough the business is. 9:21: Trump says Hillary will be a “poor” president because she doesn’t understand trade.

He says he’s now going to Nebraska and West Virginia. “We’re going to get those miners back to work,” he says. Trump says he watched Clinton talk about miners as if they are just numbers. “Let me tell you: The miners of West Virginia and Pennsylvania  …     and Ohio.. and all over will start to work again,” Trump says. “They’re going to be proud again to be miners. ” 9:16: A victorious Trump appears at Trump Tower and starts by thanking his family. 9:14: Sanders projected to win Indiana: BREAKING: Bernie Sanders is projected winner in the Indiana Democratic primary https:  .  #Decision2016 pic. twitter.   —   NBC News (@NBCNews) May 4, 2016,  9:00: Priebus declares Trump “presumptive GOP nominee,” calls on Republicans to defeat Clinton. . @realDonaldTrump will be presumtive @GOP nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton #NeverClinton,  —   Reince Priebus (@Reince) May 4, 2016,  8:58: On CNN, Van Jones, who is worried about Trump’s appeal in a general election, points out that Clinton still hasn’t sealed the deal on the left for the same reasons Trump clinched on the right. 8:41: Cruz says “it appears that path has been foreclosed. ” He says we left it all on the field in Indiana “but the voters chose another path. ” He says “with a heavy heart and with boundless optimism” and “for the   future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign. ” “But hear me now: I am not suspending our fight for liberty,” he says.

Now, mainstream media reporters seem to be finally getting it. On CNN, John King and Gloria Borger pointed out that Trump has succeeded this election cycle because GOP establishment leaders treated the voters who gave them their power and majority with nothing but disdain. Conservative commentator Jeffrey Lord said that the GOP’s success under   led to many Republicans who came to Washington as revolutionaries and then became consummate insiders who then lost touch with the Reagan revolutionary voters. Kayleigh McEnany said that the “Never Trump” movement, like the GOP establishment did tried to do to Tea Party voters, only care about tearing Trump down and that is why the movement is flailing and failing. McEnany and Lord sound like real people who are in touch with average Americans, unlike CNN panelist Amanda Carpenter, who is rabidly   and sounds like a consummate Washington insider who is most at home parroting talking   points that   consultants send around in the morning. 6:33: Krauthammer concedes “stop Trump” campaign over if Trump wins Indiana. . @krauthammer: “If @tedcruz loses  …     there is no ‘stop Trump’ campaign. @realDonaldTrump will have the nomination. ” pic. twitter.   —   Fox News (@FoxNews) May 3, 2016,  6:19: Could Clinton pull out a victory in Indiana?

From @CorrectRecord: pic. twitter.   —   Alex   (@aseitzwald) May 3, 2016,  3:56: Tony Lee: Earlier, Cruz again claimed that even Fox News is the Donald Trump network and cynical media executives want Trump to be the GOP nominee because Clinton will steamroll him en route to the White House. Not so fast. Clinton, who is much more of a policy wonk than a gifted politician, has trouble connecting with   whites as much as she does with black activists. A lack of enthusiasm for her candidacy among black base voters combined with enthusiasm for Trump’s candidacy among   voters of all backgrounds may open the door for a general election victory for Trump. In addition, there may be a reverse Bill Bradley effect in the general election, as women and minorities may be reluctant to tell pollsters, strangers and perhaps even friends that they will vote for Trump. If the mainstream media really thought Clinton would steamroll Trump, wouldn’t they be hyping how well Trump would fare against Clinton in the general instead of repeatedly saying (as if they are trying to convince themselves while knowing Clinton is far from a   to win the general election) that Trump has no chance against Clinton in the general? 3:55: Andrea Mitchell, echoing what an AP reporter discovered in Appalachia, tells Clinton, “Appalachia used to be Bill Clinton Country. Now, it’s Donald Trump country. ” Clinton claimed that her comments about wanting to put the coal industry out of business was “totally out of context from what I meant” and it was a “misstatement. ” 3:45: CLINTON REPEATEDLY PLAYS GENDER CARD IN INTERVIEW WITH MSNBC’S ANDREA MITCHELL: Clinton claims she is a “change candidate,” telling Mitchell, “I can’t imagine more change than having the first woman president. ” She adds that she is on the bring of being the “first woman nominated by a national party to run for president. ” She says her campaign has raised millions of dollars already off of Trump’s comments about her gender. She adds, “we’re not going to be counted out. ” She says women will “claim what is rightfully ours’ in the workplace, society, and political system.  She also said a “woman’s card unfortunately doesn’t give you a discount” even though women don’t get equal pay. Regarding her comments about knowing how to deal with “men who go off the reservation,” Clinton claims she was referring to Rudy Giuliani’s “intemperate” attacks and temper tantrums. She also said she also handled Rick Lazio during her Senate race, who Clinton said was “similarly going after me. ” “I have political experience in dealing with candidates who think they are going to score points by being either negative about women in general or me in particular,” she said.

She said coal companies are not taking into account years of labor and commitment of their employees. 3:45:  In the MSNBC interview, Clinton suggests she will be tougher on Putin than Trump, saying that Putin blamed her personally for demonstrations in Russia against his rigged election. 3:33: Clinton says she has not been contacted by the FBI and claims foreign nations did not hack her private email server.

But listen to Cruz’s interview. Just like he did when he confronted a Trump supporter and sounded like a D. C. elitist thumbing his nose at regular people, he sounds like a Senator reading a prepared script even when attacking Trump. He seems incapable of speaking like a normal person, and that is part of the of the reason why Cruz (with his Ivy League pedigree) much to his chagrin and frustration, has not been able to viscerally connect with   voters. 3:00: A day when his campaign may effectively end, Cruz decided it was time to finally say what he thinks about Donald Trump. Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and a serial “philanderer” who jokes about “venereal disease” and who will betray and lie to his supporters on every issue. He said Trump is an “amoral” and “arrogant buffoon” who accuses everyone else of doing whatever he does and says Trump believes whatever lie he is telling at the moment. Cruz said Trump could tell three different lies on the same day and pass a lie detector test each time. He also said Trump is an insecure narcissist and bully who is terrified by strong women and said Trump’s insecurity is why he builds giant buildings and puts his name on them. Trump’s campaign blasted Cruz’s “outburst,” saying he was becoming “unhinged” because of his “flailing” campaign. That was an impressive meltdown  …     Desperate but impressive.

How did this   voter get airtime on MSNBC? 10:00: New York Times: Messrs. Rubio, Schumer convinced Fox News to give   Gang of Eight Senators “breathing room” on comprehensive amnesty bill: A few weeks after Senator Marco Rubio joined a bipartisan push for an immigration overhaul in 2013, he arrived alongside Senator Chuck Schumer at the executive dining room of News Corporation’s Manhattan headquarters for dinner. Their mission was to persuade Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the media empire, and Roger Ailes, the chairman and chief executive of its Fox News division, to keep the network’s   personalities from savaging the legislation and give it a fighting chance at survival. Mr. Murdoch, an advocate of immigration reform, and Mr. Ailes, his top lieutenant and the most powerful man in conservative television, agreed at the Jan. 17, 2013, meeting to give the senators some breathing room. But the media executives, highly attuned to the intensifying anger in the Republican grass roots, warned that the senators also needed to make their case to Rush Limbaugh, the king of conservative talk radio, who held enormous sway with the party’s largely   base. [  …    ] The dinner at News Corporation headquarters  —   which has not been previously reported  —   and the subsequent outreach to Mr. Limbaugh illustrate the degree to which Mr. Rubio served as the chief envoy to the conservative media for the group supporting the legislation. The bill would have provided a pathway to American citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants along with measures to secure the borders and ensure that foreigners left the United States upon the expiration of their visas. It is a history that Mr. Rubio is not eager to highlight as he takes on Donald J. Trump, his rival for the Republican presidential nomination, who has made his vow to crack down on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign.

He rails against   “sexism” that women still face. He also says “this campaign is listening to the   community. They are asking how does it happen in this country  …     that we have more people in jail than in any other country on earth. ” He rails against institutional racism. He says his campaign is also listening to our “brothers and sisters in the Latino community” who are tired of being exploited, living in the shadows, and seeing their friends and family get deported. 9:42: Sanders says his campaign is doing well because “we are listening to the pain and the needs of ordinary people and  not to the needs of billionaire campaign contributors. ” 9:35: In Minnesota, Sanders says the campaign is about “transforming America” and “thinking big. ” He says that in the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth in the wrong direction. Sanders accuses Republican lawmakers of making it harder for people to vote to “get out of politics and get another job” if they fear free and fair elections.

They make “anger” seem   re: Hillary and something destructive when speaking about Trump supporters who are “angry” at Washington. Flashback: Anger gets people to the polls: A 2011 University of Michigan study found that anger actually motivates people to vote. “Anger in politics can play a particularly vital role, motivating some people to participate in ways they might ordinarily not,” Nicholas Valentino, the study’s lead author and a professor of communication studies and political science, said. “We normally think people with a lot of resources and political skills are the ones who participate, but many citizens in this category regularly abstain from politics. Furthermore, many citizens with few resources can be mobilized if they experience strong anger. ” Valentino added that “anger leads citizens to harness existing skills and resources in a given election. Therefore, the process by which emotions are produced in each campaign can powerfully alter electoral outcomes. ” 8:43: That’s why they do it.

She also thanks five mothers whose sons were killed by   violence —  including Trayvon Martin’s —  who campaigned for her across South Carolina. 7:52: Clinton says   Street will “pay a price” if they turn their backs on America. 7:51: Clinton also says this victory for the entrepreneur who told her more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else.

Scott, who admitted being family friends with Clinton’s South Carolina state director, said she only had one contact with the Sanders campaign, and it went “sour. ” Like many South Carolinians, Scott has received calls at home from phone bankers. She said one of these entreaties from the Sanders campaign led her to go off on a   tirade and demand an apology. “One of my experiences that I think I won’t forget for a long time is a call that I got from the Sanders campaign. This person that called asked me was I voting for Sen. Sanders. I said no. I was voting for Secretary Clinton. The phone went silent for a little bit,” Scott recounted. “You could hear this person struggling to come up with what they’re going to say next.   …     They call that a real pregnant pause, nine months’ worth of pregnant pause. And he finally came back and he says to me, ‘You know, Senator Sanders is for welfare. ’” This did not provoke a positive reaction from Scott. “I lost it. So you’re going to assume either from my voice or from my selection that the most important thing that Senator Sanders is going to be working on that would interest me is more welfare?” Scott said. “I went on to read him the riot act. Listen, I’m not only a college graduate I’ve got a masters. My daughter is a college graduate. I have never had one ounce of welfare before. I ain’t never lived in public housing. None of those things. ” According to Scott, the Sanders supporter who called her “didn’t know what to say. ” “By the time he hung up, it was t10n minutes later,” she said. “I got one of the managers to call me back and apologize. ” 6:35: Sanders far away from South Carolina: We’re awaiting #SCPrimary results in Minnesota, where @BernieSanders arrives tonight.

Marco Rubio of stealing from the Florida Republican Party and suggested Rubio should have been “indicted” for using a state party American Express card for personal expenses. “Rubio stole from the Republican Party,” Trump said of Rubio, with whom he has recently engaged in a public war of words. Rubio used a corporate American Express card that the Florida state GOP entrusted to him during his time as a Florida state lawmaker for tens of thousands of dollars in personal expenses, which he later reimbursed. In November, Rubio released nearly two years of statements for the card, hoping to put to rest any lingering questions of impropriety. Trump suggested on Saturday that Rubio only reimbursed the funds after he was caught. “For some reason, he didn’t get indicted. Why didn’t he get indicted?” Trump asked. 3:10: The real reason why GOP elites may hate Trump and love Rubio: Opposition to the Trump Wall drives much of the GOP elite’s   effort.

As Rubio attacks Trump University  …    Bloomberg reported last year: Last summer, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida asked the U. S. Department of Education to “demonstrate leniency” toward Corinthian Colleges by permitting the wealthy   company to continue accessing millions of dollars in federal financial aid while it was cooperating with a federal investigation. Ten months later, the company shuttered its remaining 28 campuses, instantly displacing some 16, 000 students just days after it was fined $30 million by the Department of Education for a scheme involving “confirmed cases of misrepresentation of job placement rates” for as many as 947 students. The decision to close shop came after years of federal and state investigations into the company. The   Republican presidential candidate had made his plea in a letter —  obtained by Bloomberg Politics —  dated June 20, 2014 and addressed to Jim Shelton, the deputy secretary of education, and Ted Mitchell, the undersecretary for   education. “It has been brought to my attention that the U. S. Department of Education has recently placed extreme financial constraints on Corinthian Colleges, Inc. by restricting the company’s timely access to federal financial aid. It is my understanding the the Department of Education has requested extensive documents be provided by Corinthian Colleges for review, and Corinthian has acted in good faith to try to provide these documents as expeditiously as possible,” Rubio wrote. “While I commend the Department’s desire to protect our nation’s students from fraudulent and malicious activity by any institution of higher education, regardless of tax status, I believe the Department can and should demonstrate leniency as long as Corinthian Colleges, Inc. continues to expeditiously and earnestly cooperate by providing the documents requested. ” 2:42: Big Rubio crowd in Georgia: 4000+ supporters in Kennesaw to see Marco Rubio @FOX5Atlanta pic. twitter.   —   Trevor Shirley (@Trevor_Fox5) February 27, 2016,  4, 500 to 5k would be a good crowd estimate for the Marco Rubio event in Cobb.

       "        <td>When Donald J. Trump hosted a foreign leader for the first time as   the guest list included a curious entry: Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who looked on last month while he and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan chatted on a white couch high above Manhattan. Some 6, 700 miles from Trump Tower, in Tokyo, another exclusive gathering was already underway: a   private viewing of Ivanka Trump products, teeming with   treasures like a sample of the pale pink dress Ms. Trump wore to introduce her father at the Republican National Convention. Ms. Trump is nearing a licensing deal with the Japanese apparel giant Sanei International, both parties told The New York Times. The largest shareholder of Sanei’s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government. Discussions for the deal have been active for about two years, Ms. Trump’s company said. In that time, she has become something of a local fascination. “At the moment,” said Sayumi Gunji, a   editor who attended the viewing, “Ivanka is even more popular here than Mr. Trump. ” The circumstances highlight the remarkable tangle awaiting the Trump family, its sprawling business empire and those who have interacted with the family at home and abroad  —   a web of complications that seems certain to persist even if Mr. Trump makes good on his promise to remove himself from his company’s business operations. Since his election, Mr. Trump has chafed at the suggestion that keeping his business in the family could create problems, despite several episodes during his transition that seemed to mix business and diplomacy. While he has insisted that he faces no legal requirement to turn over the company, the Trump Organization has said it is preparing an “immediate transfer of management” to Mr. Trump’s three eldest children  —   Donald Jr. 38 Ivanka, 35 and Eric, 32  —   along with a team of executives. Last week, the   said on Twitter that he would make an announcement with the children on Dec. 15 about “leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country. ” Doing so is “visually important,” he wrote, “to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses. ” Yet an examination of the professional histories of the three children  —   who also serve on the presidential transition team  —   shows how deeply the Trump family, Trump business and Trump politics are interwoven, raising significant doubts about how meaningful a wall can ever be erected between Mr. Trump and his heirs at the Trump Organization. For years, the three siblings have operated with few rigid dividing lines in their international travels as ambassadors of the Trump brand, allowing them to lean heavily on the reputation and financial backing of their father while establishing their own credibility in business. It is not merely that the Trumps are at peace commingling family and business. They have known no other way. Officially, all three siblings are executive vice presidents for development and acquisitions. Practically, they have served as their father’s advance guard: the polished public faces of the next Trump generation, conducting initial meetings with prospective partners and reporting back to Mr. Trump. “We don’t take titles particularly seriously at the Trump Organization,” Ms. Trump said in a deposition this year. In depositions in 2011, both brothers likened the company to a “mom and pop” operation. Since the three joined the business, shortly after each graduated from college, lines have had a way of blurring. When Donald Trump Jr. ’s investment in a concrete paneling business in South Carolina faltered in recent years, leaving him personally responsible for a loan of more than $3 million, the Trump Organization helped bail him out. Before Eric Trump, who oversees Trump golf courses and a Virginia winery, faced questioning in a lawsuit from aggrieved club members in Florida, his father signed a letter saying that unhappy patrons would be “out. ” Ms. Trump, the only sibling to match her father’s instinct for   has used the Trump Organization’s payroll, information technology and human resources for her separate brand. Her website’s domain was registered by Trump Organization lawyers. “It is, of course, an advantage to be my father’s daughter,” Ms. Trump told an audience in Malaysia, via videoconference, in 2008. “I think it has afforded me many great opportunities. ” All three children declined to be interviewed for this article and did not respond to written questions sent to the Trump Organization about their outside business ties. In its statement about the transfer of management, the Trump Organization said that “the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations. ” Still, for an enterprise premised in large measure on the relentless marketing of a surname, the most famous Trump cannot help looming largest in perpetuity, experts in government ethics say, opening the door to conflicts inside and outside the United States. “Giving to the Trump family would be seen by many foreign leaders as the way to get in with the Trump administration,” said Meredith McGehee, an adviser to the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit group, who worried that companies might be tempted to direct business to the Trump children to curry favor with their father. Already, complications abound. The children each hold a stake in the lease that allows the organization to operate the Trump International Hotel out of the federal government’s Old Post Office Building in Washington. Mr. Trump, as president, will appoint the head of the General Services Administration, which manages the property, while his children oversee a hotel with millions of dollars in ties to the agency. During the transition  —   in which Ms. Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, is also a key player  —   diplomatic standards have sometimes been muddied, assuming the freewheeling feel of Mr. Trump’s campaign and business life. In addition to attending the meeting with Mr. Abe, Ms. Trump was present for her father’s initial conversation with President Mauricio Macri of Argentina. The children also met recently with Jose E. B. Antonio, a Philippine developer who is collaborating with the Trumps on a tower in Manila and who in October was named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte. The business partnership grew out of a friendship between Mr. Antonio’s son Robbie and Ms. Trump. Eric Trump is also listed on an advisory committee for one of the younger Mr. Antonio’s ventures: a company making luxury modular homes. Even nonbusiness expeditions have grown more tense since Election Day. Over Thanksgiving weekend, Donald Trump Jr. traveled to hunt wild goats in Turkey, where the elder Mr. Trump has “a little conflict of interest,” he acknowledged in a radio interview last year, because of “a major, major building in Istanbul”  —   actually twin Trump Towers. Security for the hunt was high, with private guards and Turkish intelligence officers, according to an official involved in the trip who was not authorized to discuss it. Long before their father’s election, the Trump children’s international trips often included audiences with heads of state. “Met with the president,” Donald Jr. said after an outing in Colombia, describing his work life as part of a   video in 2011. “Did a bunch of other stuff. ” At times, the   has grown incredulous when pressed on the specter of conflicts. In an interview last month with The Times, he wondered aloud what harm might come from, say, taking a picture with business partners for a project his children were leading. He suggested some critics would prefer that he “never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. ” He allowed, though, that his election had changed at least one thing. “The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before,” he said. “I can’t help that, but I don’t care. ” Grooming began early in the Trump family. For as long as they can remember, the children visited job sites, as Mr. Trump had done as a boy with his father, Fred. They sat in on meetings with executives and government officials, where, between fits of   Mr. Trump held forth on his daughter’s progress in school. They came to learn that the surest way to reach Mr. Trump was to call the office. “I always joke, I have been working in the company for 37 years,” Donald Jr. said in a Fox News special, “Meet the Trumps,” this year, “because we had that kind of level of access and because he was always there with us. ” His first job, as a teenager, was at the Trump Castle marina in Atlantic City, where he earned minimum wage, plus tips, as a dock attendant. One of Ivanka Trump’s earliest architectural feats came when she was 6, according to family lore: She stole her younger brother’s Lego set, she recalled in 2007, and built a model of Trump Tower in his room. Four days later, she said, her father scolded her  —   for rendering the structure with five setbacks instead of four. Despite this lengthy tutelage, Mr. Trump resisted a presidential run in 2012 in part because he did not believe his children were ready to succeed him. (The   also has a daughter Tiffany, 23, from his second marriage, and a son Barron, 10, with his current wife, Melania.) While the eldest three have been presented, with Trumpian gusto, as business successes of the highest order, there have been some stumbles  —   cushioned often by the   advantages of being a Trump. The succession plan itself has not always been smooth. For a time, Donald Jr. who did not speak to his father for a year after his parents’ divorce, was ambivalent about joining the business, spending a year after college in Colorado working in a bar and hunting in his spare time. Since joining the Trump Organization in 2001, moving quickly to learn the intricacies of financing and construction, he has said repeatedly that he does not expect preferential treatment. “He puts on zero in the way of airs,” said Mel M. Immergut, a lawyer in New York who has long known the younger Mr. Trump and said he did not support the elder’s candidacy, or anyone else’s. But as Donald Jr. has sought to establish his own business identity, he has borrowed from his father’s playbook  —   and, occasionally, his payroll. He and Ivanka were paid speakers at a “creating wealth” forum that was described as free but featured event promoters seeking to enlist attendees for expensive courses on how to get rich. He has positioned himself as a spokesman for a hodgepodge of companies, including Cambridge Who’s Who, a publisher that produces a registry in which consumers pay to be listed. The younger Mr. Trump spoke about the company during interviews on Fox Business Network and TheStreet. com. Cambridge, which has drawn hundreds of complaints from customers who say they were misled by its promises, said it had benefited from its partnership with Donald Jr. through “leveraging relationships built by the Trump empire. ” In 2011, Donald Jr. also became the public face of a Tulsa, Okla.  company, MacroSolve, that primarily sued other companies, like Facebook and Walmart, over claims that they had infringed on its patent for a mobile device application. After several setbacks in court, the company has changed its focus. Yet it is his foray into South Carolina manufacturing that offers perhaps the most unfiltered view of Donald Jr. ’s independent business dealings. In 2010, the younger Mr. Trump helped found a company in the depressed suburb North Charleston called Titan Atlas Manufacturing, which made cast panels for prefabricated houses. Titan Atlas’s chief executive was an old friend named Jeremy Blackburn, who, before the company’s formation, acknowledged while settling a lawsuit that he had been part of a scheme to defraud a businessman who claimed he had lost $1 million. In an email, Mr. Blackburn said he had done nothing wrong. Along with the North Charleston project, Mr. Trump and Mr. Blackburn sought business deals in Mexico and Colombia, traveling with executives of the Trump Organization and Yun Capital, an investment firm involved in Trump Organization projects abroad. In 2011, Yun Capital registered the trademark JB Development on Mr. Blackburn’s behalf, filings show. By 2012, Titan Atlas was mired in debt, prompting a suit from a Philadelphia law firm it had hired to represent it. The firm claimed it was owed $400, 000 in unpaid fees. After Mr. Blackburn filed for personal bankruptcy, the law firm turned its attention to Donald Jr. issuing a subpoena for him to testify about Titan Atlas’s assets. The Trump Organization jumped to his defense. In a letter on company letterhead, Alan Garten, the organization’s general counsel, threatened to file a disciplinary complaint about a lawyer at the firm if he sought to bring Donald Jr. into the case. In an interview, Mr. Garten said he had been “asked to assist” in resolving the matter even though it fell outside the purview of the Trump Organization. “If Don makes an investment in a company and legal assistance is needed, I’m happy to get involved,” Mr. Garten said, adding, “I have always viewed my role as representing not just the company but its principals. ” The firm in Philadelphia pressed ahead with its suit despite the threat. On the eve of Donald Jr. ’s testimony, though, a confidential settlement was reached. Separately, in late 2014, the Trump Organization formed an entity that took over a $3. 65 million loan made by Deutsche Bank in 2011 to Titan Atlas. The younger Mr. Trump had been a   on the loan. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, which is a major lender to the Trump Organization, declined to disclose the details of that transaction. Mr. Garten described Donald Jr. as a “passive” investor in Titan Atlas. Asked why the Trump Organization had taken over an unrelated business loan to the younger Mr. Trump, Mr. Garten said he “can’t speak to that. ” “This was an investment made by Don,” Mr. Garten said. “Ultimately, it was not successful. ” The siblings occupy neighboring offices on Trump Tower’s 25th floor, one level below their father. They often gather for a breakfast meeting at the Trump Grill. They hold equivalent titles at the Trump Organization. There is little doubt, though, whom Mr. Trump admires most. Ivanka Trump was often her father’s most potent surrogate during the campaign, an essential bridge to female voters who might have been dismayed by Mr. Trump’s disparaging comments about women and the allegations of sexual assault against him. Ms. Trump’s image as a stylish businesswoman, and now mother, has long lifted her brand, steering Ivanka Trump products into stores from Alabama to Kuwait and establishing her as the   famous Trump. Department stores throughout the country sell Ivanka Trump shoes, Ivanka Trump clothes, Ivanka Trump handbags. She has traveled widely  —   sometimes with her father or brothers, often without them  —   as a fresher face of the family brand, at times convening with foreign dignitaries: an adviser to the Ukrainian president a governor of Rio de Janeiro Queen Rania of Jordan. Often wearing the kinds of heels and sheath dresses sold under her name, Ms. Trump stars in an impeccably curated Instagram feed, filled with product placement, pictures of her children and the promotion of a hashtag: #womenwhowork. With Mr. Trump’s election, at least one licensing partner quickly sensed an opportunity. After Ms. Trump appeared with her father on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” reporters received an email promoting the bracelet she had worn on the program: a $10, 800 bangle from her own line. Amid criticism that Ms. Trump was using her father’s victory for financial gain, her company announced that it was “proactively discussing new policies and procedures. ” Ms. Trump has also said she will separate her personal Twitter and Instagram accounts from those of her brand, which she wholly owns. Given its international renown, that brand is likely to flourish under a Trump administration regardless of social media strategy. In 2013, before the debut of a major clothing partnership, about $75 million worth of handbags, shoes and other products bearing Ms. Trump’s name sold at wholesale, according to a company document reviewed by The Times. Of that, Ms. Trump’s company would have received roughly $4 million to $6 million, according to people familiar with the business’s financial data who were not authorized to speak publicly. The company declined to comment on the figures but pointed to public statements from   the company that makes Ivanka Trump clothing, which estimated the line’s revenue at $100 million in the past fiscal year. In Japan, where news of her inclusion in the meeting with Mr. Abe inspired a media frenzy, she has become an object of intrigue for her glamorous image and powerful position in the Trump orbit. Japanese news reports often refer to her as Mr. Trump’s “beloved” and “beautiful” daughter. The expected deal with Sanei, the Japanese apparel company, is the result of a longstanding relationship between Sanei and Abigail Klem, an executive for Ms. Trump’s company who previously worked for Diane von Furstenberg, a label that Sanei licenses in Japan, according to Ms. Trump’s team. Her company said the terms of the agreement had been decided before the election. To date, Ivanka Trump apparel and jewelry have been available to Japanese shoppers through a small number of independent import sites. One of them, waja. co. jp, has reported a   increase in sales since the election, according to the local news media. On the home front, one of Ms. Trump’s ventures was less successful. In 2007, Ms. Trump opened Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry on Madison Avenue, a short walk from Trump Tower. Her brothers had offered guidance, at least briefly, during a tour before the opening, flagging a structural misalignment in a bathroom. Like many other Trump family endeavors, the jewelry business was a licensing deal. Rings and necklaces in the Ivanka Trump line came through a partnership with a diamond wholesaler based in New York. In 2011, as Ms. Trump’s store migrated to a space in SoHo, troubles mounted. Ms. Trump’s partner, Madison Avenue Diamonds, which operated Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, was sued by a former supplier, KGK, which claimed to be owed more than $2 million. The partner’s lawyers accused KGK of incorporating fake stones into   jewelry, saying that some gold pieces had “at times turned wearers’ skin green. ” By the time the problem was discovered, the lawyers wrote, Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry had already sold 119 of the more than 250 problematic pieces, “potentially creating a public relations disaster” that would endanger the business. KGK won its suit for reasons unrelated to the stones, whose authenticity was never proved or disproved in court. The supplier denied the allegations in court documents. Y. David Scharf, a lawyer for Madison Avenue Diamonds, said that “extensive efforts were taken to remove the nonconforming items from the market” and that all requests for exchanges had been honored. There was an attempt to contact anyone who had purchased the products in question, Mr. Scharf added, but not every customer could be reached. The licensing arrangement has allowed Ms. Trump to maintain a safe distance from any turmoil, and Ivanka Trump jewelry is still sold worldwide. But the SoHo store closed without fanfare last year. There is not, at least so far, much of an Eric Trump brand to license. By most accounts, though, the youngest child of Donald J. Trump and Ivana Trump has been an effective steward of the Trump Winery in Virginia, which has won local acclaim for its sparkling and still wines. Eric Trump, who oversees the family’s golf courses, has also shown that he is comfortable with conflict. Shortly after the Trump Organization bought a luxury spa and golf course in Jupiter, Fla. in 2012, some club members filed a lawsuit claiming that the company had violated their rights by barring them from the facility, among other matters. The Trump Organization has said it did nothing wrong, and the case remains undecided. The legal dispute centered on the contracts signed by members with the Jupiter facility’s previous owner,  . To join, members paid initiation fees ranging from $35, 000 to $210, 000, deposits that were refundable when they resigned. But that process could take years, and under   rules, those on the resignation list could still use the club if they paid annual fees and other costs like food and beverage minimums. When the Trump Organization acquired the club, it also assumed liability for those refunds, a pool of deposits totaling $41 million. But the company was eager to convert deposits into cash that could be used to improve the club. Soon, a letter arrived, signed by Donald J. Trump. It offered to reduce members’ annual fees if they agreed to convert refundable deposits into nonrefundable ones and suggested that members who wanted to resign were “out. ” “I do not want to them to utilize the club, nor do I want their dues,” the note read. But Mr. Trump testified in a deposition last year that although he had signed the letter, Eric Trump was in charge. “Eric is much more familiar with this club,” his father said. “He runs it. ” Eric Trump contended in his pretrial testimony that members seeking to resign had been allowed to use the club so long as they paid annual dues. “The status quo was maintained,” he said in a 2015 deposition. During a   trial in August, he was forced to backtrack. Members and club employees testified that those on the resignation list had been barred from using the club even while they received bills. Presented with this evidence, Eric Trump acknowledged that his earlier statements had been mistaken. Juggling different policies at the family’s assorted clubs was difficult, he explained. But on balance, the younger Mr. Trump testified, the estate had thrived on the family’s watch. “We took something that had gone really bad,” he said, “and we made it great again. ”</td>\n",

He says he has just received a call from Secretary Clinton. “She congratulated us  …     on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very   campaign,” he says. Trump says Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a “major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.

While all the other “strategists” gibbered about Trump losing the Hispanic vote, Marlow said: “Trump is growing the big tent.   …     Trump’s policies are appealing to blacks. There are even some polls out there, like a survey USA poll, saying Trump is actually doing fine with Latinos. ” In the Nevada primary on Tuesday, Trump not only won the Hispanic vote he not only won 17 points more of the Hispanic vote than his next closest rival but his Latino vote nearly matched that of the two Latino candidates combined. In one of the few times you might have heard this point expressed on television airwaves, Marlow said that the No. 1 issue for Breitbart News’ 20 million readers, “has consistently been  —   since last year  —   immigration. They are looking for someone who is going to seal the border and prioritize border security as No. 1. ” Obviously, Marlow was right about everything. According to Nexis, that was the last time he appeared on TV. It would be as if, after discovering America, Christopher Columbus reported back to the King and Queen of Spain, but the booker for Ferdinand and Isabella decided that, instead of Columbus, she’d get the guy who never actually set sail for the New World because he was afraid he’d fall off the edge of the Earth into a fiery pit. 11:32: Game, Set, Match?

About a quarter of voters surveyed said the debates were the most important factor in their decision in a country in which 69% of voters said they were either “angry” or “dissatisfied” with the federal government. The electorate was   for Trump’s   message on trade,   and immigration. But Trump never effectively made that case when he had the most number of eyeballs on him during the debates, which generated Super   audiences. If Trump loses tonight, it may well be because he didn’t prepare for the debates and left so many points on the field in light of the mood of the electorate, according to the   online exit poll that found (say what you want about Trump supporter Bill Belichick,  but he would have never ever let one of his players be as unprepared as Trump, who seemed like a player who did not even take the time to read his team’s playbook, was during his three debates):  —   75 percent agree that “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful. ” —   72 percent agree “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful. ” —   68 percent agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me. ” —   76 percent believe “the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth. ” —   57 percent feel that “more and more, I don’t identify with what America has become. ” —   54 percent feel “it is increasingly hard for someone like me to get ahead in America. ” 5:35: Get ready for the usual suspects to push more amnesty: Exit poll has   silly ”legalize or deport” immig. question, according to voter who took it.

       "        <td> (CNN) The world was dumbfounded by the election of Donald Trump, and his first 100 days in office have done little to alleviate a deep sense of uncertainty and unpredictability. Indeed, as one observer put it, the last few weeks alone have caused a severe case of global geostrategic whiplash. The number of campaign promises that have morphed into presidential   is staggering. Allies and adversaries alike are trying to figure out whether a Trump Doctrine is emerging, or whether, as former CIA Director Michael Hayden recently told me, a discernible doctrine does not exist in what resembles a   business of policy from the White House. National security adviser H. R. McMaster ”has hired a very bright woman to write the US National Security Strategy,” he said. ”It’s a tough job. I did it twice for George H. W. Bush. But I was building on precedent and historic consensus. It’s really going to be interesting to see what an America First national security strategy looks like when you’ve got to write it down.”   American allies are comforted, though, knowing McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis make up an experienced national security team. NATO partners also welcomed Trump’s declaration that he no longer considers the transatlantic military alliance obsolete. They, along with regional allies, supported Trump enforcing the previously declared US red line in Syria against the regime’s use of chemical weapons on its own people. After such an attack that the West attributed to the Syrian government earlier in the month, Trump launched retaliatory strikes. But Asian allies, such as South Korea and Japan, are worried about US policy on North Korea. They welcome the tougher stance against Kim Jong Un’s ramped up nuclear missile program, but they were rattled by the USS Carl Vinson debacle, when for a time it was unclear if the aircraft carrier was steaming towards North Korea or not. It raised the question of whether the administration really has its deterrence policy in order, and South Korea was said to feel utter confusion, even betrayal, when the carrier was actually found to be steaming away from, not towards, the Korean Peninsula. On Iran, signals are slightly harder to read. On the one hand, the State Department again certified Iran’s compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. Yet a day later, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson strongly hinted the US could walk away from it, or try to link it to other issues it has with Iran. So far the deal remains in place and neither the EU nor the UN would agree to reimpose international sanctions on Tehran, which helped bring the country to the negotiating table. On the Paris Climate Accord, Trump’s closest advisers seem to be having an almighty tussle about whether he should stay or stray from the historic deal. Big US companies like ExxonMobil are urging the US to abide by the deal and thereby have more say at the table. Trump has also hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping at his    estate, and seems to have reversed many of his pledges to play hardball with Beijing. But on trade, just recently a Financial Times newspaper headline blared: ”Trump Fires First Protectionist Warning over steel Industry,” saying this paves the way for a global showdown on steel and possible sweeping tariffs on steel imports. In his first 100 days, President Barack Obama visited nine countries. President George W. Bush visited two. Trump has visited none. But next month he visits Brussels for a NATO summit, and Sicily, for a meeting of the G7. Whether he can convince America’s allies that they have a   friend with a strategic worldview as their most powerful ally remains to be seen, abroad and at home. ”I think I know what the policy is,” Hayden told me. ”I have more difficulty, Christiane, putting this policy into a broader global view. And I think that’s causing unease with you, with me, and with a whole bunch of other folks who are trying to see, ’Where are the Americans going globally? ’” Afghanistan            Nick Paton Walsh, It was the mother of all statements, but he may have had nothing to do with it. The MOAB (officially know as the    Massive Ordnance Air Blast) wiped out an ISIS tunnel complex in the volatile eastern part of the country last week, killing around 90 militants. It was the largest   bomb used by the US in combat, but whether the new commander in chief personally approved its use is unclear. The airstrike was immediately followed up by National Security Adviser Gen. H. R. McMaster visiting Kabul and assuring President Ashraf Ghani his country had a friend in the US and a strategic review was under way.  Yet outside of the huge bomb and its message of might, little has changed    as the new White House is inheriting the exhaustion of both resolve and policy options of the last. A massive troop surge? Talks with the Taliban? A lighter footprint training Afghan security forces to secure the country? All have  been tried, and all have failed to stop the insurgency controlling or contesting over half Afghanistan, and the   rise of ISIS. Add to that the intense and escalating   in the Kabul political elite, and there is a very messy summer ahead, with few decent options.  China, David McKenzie  It’s arguably the world’s most important bilateral relationship. But when President Donald Trump was inaugurated back in January, several Chinese policy experts told me there was a lot of nervousness about the incoming leader. After all, during the campaign Trump said he would name China a currency manipulator on Day One of his term and threatened a trade war. As   he spoke to Taiwan’s president on the phone and openly questioned the ’One China’ policy, a cornerstone of   relations in which the US recognizes Taiwan as part of China. And Trump accused China of not doing enough to put pressure on North Korea. 100 days on? Well, it’s a   shift. In his first phone call with President Xi Jinping, Trump reaffirmed the One China policy. He has praised Beijing for taking some positive steps on the North Korea issue and he recently said that China is not manipulating its currency. Trump denies these positions represent a   the    is saying it’s all part of a deal. ”I actually told him (Xi Jinping) I said, ’You’ll make a much better deal on trade if you get rid of this menace or do something about the menace of North Korea.’ Because that’s what it is, it’s a menace right now,” Trump said last week. Trump said he has developed a strong relationship with Xi Jinping and that their scheduled   meetings at the    summit stretched into ”hours.” But Yan Xuetong, a foreign policy expert at Tsinghua University, told me that the Chinese are skeptical. He said that if North Korea goes ahead with its nuclear program, then China will take the blame. ”Trump will use China as scapegoat to tell (the) American public that it is not his problem,” said Yan. In Yan’s eyes, at least, the Chinese suspect more Trump policy turns. Egypt, Ian Lee, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   was the first foreign leader to congratulate President Donald Trump after he won the November 2016 presidential election. The two leaders had instantly hit it off when they met a few months earlier in New York. Their views are more aligned than were those of President Barack Obama, which reacted coolly to the 2013 coup by Egypt’s military    led at the time by Sisi. When he became president soon afterward, he ushered in a new low between Washington and Cairo. It was an open secret that Cairo wished for a Trump victory over Obama’s former secretary of state, Hilary Clinton. Trump was perceived by Cairo as a pragmatist who had little interest in human rights. In his first days in office, Trump invited Sisi to visit him in Washington. The Egyptian president arrived with three main objectives: deepen military cooperation, strengthen the war against terror and revive Egypt’s economy. The invitation to the White House also gave the Egyptian president a legitimacy that the Obama administration had previously denied him. Recently, in a gesture of good will and eagerness to cooperate, American Aya Hijazi was released from an Egyptian prison after Trump directly intervened to secure her release. Expect relations to remain warm as long as Trump’s administration keeps the lid on any criticism of Sisi.  Germany     Nic Robertson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel took heat from Donald Trump even before he was sworn in as president. He accused her of making a ”catastrophic mistake” on migrants, only being as trustworthy as Vladimir Putin, and intentionally trying to take business from the US. For Europeans, Trump’s attitude to Merkel is symptomatic of wider issues: his like of Brexit and his dislike of the EU’s single market and liberal trade values.  At the EU leaders summit in Malta this February, both French and German leaders said openly that Trump’s attitude was uniting Europe to stand on its own feet. Since then, Trump has said the EU is ”wonderful” and he is ”totally in favor of it.” Yet he still supports Brexit and seems unaware of the instability and frustrations Europe feels because of it. It’s not the only   reversal he has had. Coming into office, he said NATO was ”obsolete.” He told the alliance nations they need to pay their way, and has given them a deadline to promise they will. In recent weeks Trump has changed his tune. NATO, he said, is ”not obsolete”    but he still wants members’ money. Merkel’s March visit to see Trump at the White House did little to quell European concerns over his attitude to Europe, and trade in particular. That Merkel was ignored by Trump when asking for a handshake in the Oval Office, and embarrassed by him again at the news conference that followed with an awkward comment about being spied on, reveals this relationship has some way to go before it gets on an even keel.         Iran, Frederik Pleitgen  Iran’s leadership realized that Donald Trump was an unknown commodity, but many in the country’s senior leadership hoped they would be able to deal with the new man in the White House. ”We hope that he will have a pragmatic approach,” Iran’s Deputy Oil Minister, Amir Hossein Azamaninia, told me in an interview during the transition period shortly before Trump took office. He suggested that perhaps President Donald Trump would similar to the businessman Donald Trump    a shrewd dealmaker, whom the Islamic Republic with its oil wealth could possibly even strike deals with. But Iran soon learned that the new administration was going to take a harder line towards Tehran than President Barack Obama had. When Iran tested ballistic missiles in late January    which the US believes could strike targets in Israel      Security Adviser Michael Flynn came down hard and fast on Tehran, announcing there would be new sanctions. He also said the US was ”putting Iran on notice,” without specifying what that meant. This harsh reaction and subsequent statements by Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and America’s UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have sowed further uncertainty in Tehran about America’s strategy on Iran. The tough talk and action have put a severe damper on any notion the Rouhani administration had that its fairly constructive relations with Washington during the Obama years would continue. At the same time, the Trump team’s hard line seems to be having an effect on Iran’s behavior.  There have so far been fewer reports of incidents and close encounters between US and Iranian ships in the Persian Gulf’s narrow Strait of Hormuz than during the end of the Obama administration. And during Iran’s National Revolution Day in February, the leadership did not display ballistic missiles as it usually has. This has led some experts to believe that Tehran    for all its harsh rhetoric    is making an effort to not further antagonize an American president and Cabinet whom the Iranians view as erratic and very hostile towards the Islamic Republic. If this was the Trump administrations intent, it could be working. Iraq, Ben Wedeman      ”I would bomb the s**t out of them,” declared candidate Donald Trump, summarizing his strategy to defeat ISIS. ”I would bomb those suckers . .. and I’d take the oil.” The crowds loved it. A decisive victory over ISIS, plus a grand prize of a lot of cheap oil, sounds great, but the real world just doesn’t work that way and slowly, perhaps, the new administration has learned this in its first 100 days. For one thing, the battle to liberate the ISIS stronghold of Mosul, Iraq    now into its seventh month    has underscored just how hard it is to defeat the extremists. Since the push in the western part of the city began in February, both the   coalition and Iraqi forces have been bombarding ISIS as promised, using much heavier firepower than during the battle for west Mosul in the waning months of the Obama administration.       But the tactic has come at a high cost in terms of civilian casualties, brought home by what US officials concede was probably a   airstrike on March 17 that mistakenly killed almost 150 civilians. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are still in western Mosul, often exploited by ISIS as human shields.  But even with the heavy assault, the Trump administration is largely settling down and following the same slow, deliberate approach of the Obama administration. The battle for Mosul has taken more than half a year and may take many more months. In neighboring Syria, there are nearly a thousand US boots on the ground, backing a mixed   force that aims at overrunning the city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of ISIS. When this will happen is anyone’s guess.  And then there’s that other topic Trump has toyed with: taking Iraq’s oil. That was decisively shot down by Defense Secretary James Mattis, who flew to Baghdad in February and told reporters, ”We’re not in Iraq to seize anyone’s oil.” Israel                        Oren Liebermann  Donald Trump’s fiery   rhetoric during the campaign had the right and far right in Israel salivating at the prospects of a Trump administration, while Palestinians worried about an American government adopting a more hostile stance. Trump pledged to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, ”dismantle” the Iran deal, reduce funding to the United Nations and cut aid to the Palestinians. At the same time, Trump said he wanted to close ”the ultimate deal”    a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Save for the last, Trump has moderated his stance and backed off his positions in his first 100 days in office. The Trump administration has said its still considering an embassy move, but has also called Israeli settlements in the West Bank unhelpful for peace and acknowledged that Iran is sticking by the terms of the nuclear deal. Some analysts in Israel have pointed out that Trump’s positions on the region are beginning to resemble Obama’s positions. The Israeli right wing’s fervor over Trump has cooled somewhat, but it still expects him to be a friend in the White House. From Israel’s perspective, the big star of the Trump administration so far is US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, who has repeatedly criticized the United Nations for focusing disproportionately on Israel. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly praised Trump, refusing to suggest even the slightest hint of criticism, since he entered office. Meanwhile, a recent visit by Trump’s special representative for international negotiations, Jason Greenblatt, left Palestinians cautiously optimistic that prospects weren’t as grim as initially feared and that Trump was serious about attempting to restart negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to meet Trump in Washington shortly after Trump hits the   mark. The meeting could be a litmus test of how the dynamic between Trump, Netanyahu and Abbas develops. Mexico                   Leyla Santiago, President Trump still has yet to meet    with Mexico’s president, Enrique Pena Nieto, after an awkward encounter during the 2016 campaign. According to Mexican government officials, no plans are in the works, signaling tensions remain between the two leaders. Twitter exchanges, however, have cooled down since a public war of words in January between @EPN and @realDonaldTrump over payment for a wall along the   border. Mexico still maintains it will not pay for Trump’s muro (wall).  Many Mexicans still fear Trump could cut off a portion of their income, if he imposes taxes on remittances as a form of payment for the wall. The Mexican government says, though, that its No. 1 concern is human rights violations. It has invested $50 million to expand legal services at its consulates and embassies in the US in an effort to help Mexicans fearing deportation.  Major questions also loom over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has called the    deal that allows free trade between Mexico, Canada and the US a   agreement. If a good deal is not renegotiated, Mexico plans to walk away from the pact. The uncertainty in trade relations has led Mexico to strengthen ties with other countries and explore opportunities in Asian, European and South American markets instead of the US.  After Mexico featured repeatedly in the US elections, Trump himself is now playing a role in who will become Mexico’s next leader.   rhetoric has become a central part of Mexican campaigns heading toward the 2018 election. Leading candidates are hoping a stance against Trump will protect Mexico’s interests and win over voters.  North Korea, Will Ripley, When I ask ordinary North Koreans about the impact of President Donald Trump on their lives, they give strikingly similar answers. The response is usually something like this: ”It doesn’t matter who the US president is. All that matters is that they discontinue America’s hostile policy against my country.” Of course, they are only repeating the same message given to them by their   media, the only media North Koreans have access to. Because US politics are not a primary focus of North Korean propaganda, the vast majority of citizens are blissfully unaware of Trump’s twitter account or the cloud of controversy that has swirled around the first 100 days of his administration. But they are aware of a few key facts. They know that Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian regime air base, viewed by many as an indirect threat to Pyongyang. They also know that Trump dispatched the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group to the waters off the Korean Peninsula, albeit by an indirect route. The reason North Koreans know these things is simple: The actions of the Trump administration play right into their government’s   narrative that they are under the imminent threat of attack by the ’imperialist’ United States. People have been told for their entire lives that America could drop a nuclear bomb at anytime. Citizens always voice their unanimous support of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. Of course, in an authoritarian country where political dissent is not tolerated, there are no opposing voices. The North Korean government uses this ’imminent threat’ to justify its substantial investment in weapons of mass destruction, even if this means citizens must sacrifice. And government officials in Pyongyang told me the policies of the Trump administration in its first 100 days only add to their sense of urgency to accelerate development of a viable intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the mainland US. They say such a weapon is key to their survival as a nation, even as critics fear North Korea continuing down the nuclear road will only lead to further diplomatic isolation, economic hardship or worse. There are signs that North Korea is monitoring and responding to the unpredictable rhetoric and actions of the Trump administration. After news broke that the USS Carl Vinson strike group was headed to the Korean Peninsula, I was   a statement in Pyongyang saying, ”The DPRK is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the US.” We’ve never seen dynamics like this before. An untested US President who tweets in real time and isn’t afraid to launch missiles to prove a point. And a North Korean leader who has consolidated his power by purging opponents (including his own uncle) and has launched more missiles than his father and grandfather combined.  This could be a recipe for disaster. Or a recipe for lasting peace. Or perhaps a recipe for the continuation of a   stalemate. If Trump’s first 100 days provide any clues, it’s going to be a wild ride regardless. Russia     Matthew Chance  President Donald Trump entered the White House on a promise of improving the strained relationship between Washington and Moscow. He was full of praise for his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, suggesting he might recognize annexed Crimea as Russian, cooperate over international terrorism and join forces in Syria. It was all music to the Kremlin’s ears and talk was of a pivotal moment, of the Trump administration transforming the way in which the United States and Russia saw each other. But 100 days on, none of that has come to pass. ”One could say the level of trust on a working level, especially on the military level, has not improved,” said Putin on April 12, ”but rather has deteriorated.” US officials have criticized Russia for fueling conflict in Ukraine, castigated the Kremlin for its treatment of sexual minorities, even bombed Russia’s Syrian ally while implying Moscow might have been complicit in dozens of agonizing deaths there caused by chemical weapons.  Part of the reason is undoubtedly the toxic political atmosphere in Washington, where lingering allegations of Russian interference in the US presidential election are being investigated by Congress. But there is also a growing sense that the Trump administration, at 100 days old, has finally encountered a stark reality: Russia and the United States simply have different geopolitical priorities    whether in Syria, Ukraine or elsewhere    that won’t be easily reconciled.  Syria, Clarissa Ward, When President Donald Trump first assumed office, his strategy on Syria, like much of his foreign policy, was opaque. On the campaign trail he had said that his priority was to eliminate ISIS    indeed, he promised to put together a plan to do so in his first 30 days. He attempted to place a ban on any Syrian refugees entering the US, calling them a security threat. But on the subject of Syria’s leader, Bashar   and the brutal civil war he has presided over that has claimed more than 400, 000 lives, he was noticeably silent. Trump’s strong admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and interesting in getting the relationship with Russia back on track led many to assume that he would do little to interfere in Syria, where Moscow is closely allied with Damascus. This was reinforced by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s comment in March that it would be ”up to the Syrian people” whether or not Assad would go, a demand long made by the Obama administration. Regime change, it seemed, was no longer desirable for the US. Yet, within a few weeks, everything changed. After seeing the aftermath of a chemical weapons attack in Idlib that killed dozens of children, Trump suddenly took action against the Assad regime. Two days later, dozens of American tomahawk missiles rained down on the regime’s Shayrat air base. The Syrian people were stunned. Those who oppose Assad had dreamed of this moment for many years, but after President Barack Obama had chosen not to enforce his red line against Assad’s use of chemical weapons in 2013, their dream had died. Suddenly, Trump was hailed as something of a hero. Some took to calling him by a new nom de guerre, Abu Ivanka al Amriki. The strikes on Shayrat changed very little on the ground in Syria. The regime was continuing its daily bombardment within hours. Still, after six years of standing on the sidelines, the shift in US policy (if it is a sustained shift) has given some cause for optimism. There is hope that perhaps Assad will think twice before using chemical weapons against his own people, that the US may now have more leverage at the negotiating table. Yet the question still remains: What is the US’s policy on Syria? 100 days into the Trump presidency, we still don’t really know. Turkey, Ian Lee  Relations with the Obama administration warmed under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan when that suited him and then soured accordingly. They have yet to be really tested under President Donald Trump. Since taking office, Trump has taken a softer tone in dealing with Turkey. Ankara responded positively to the United States’ missile strike on a Syrian air base. Trump congratulated the Turkish president for the success of his referendum, giving him significantly expanded powers, despite the process being deeply flawed according to international monitors, an opinion echoed by the State Department. By the time President Barack Obama left office,   relations had cooled. The two leaders had differing opinions regarding Syria. Where Obama wanted to focus on defeating ISIS while Erdogan wanted to oust President Bashar  . The United States saw Syrian Kurdish militants, the YPG, as an ally against ISIS, while the Turks viewed them as terrorists. And Obama criticized Turkey’s crackdown on the political opposition, intellectuals, activists and journalists and wouldn’t extradite spiritual leader Fetullah Gulen, on whom the Turkish blames July’s coup attempt. Elements of Erdogan’s party even accused the United States of supporting the failed effort.    There is optimism in Turkey among the government and its supporters that a new page can be turned, especially when both leaders plan to meet in Washington in May.  But Trump is likely to face similar tensions as Obama did. One of the toughest will be the upcoming operation against ISIS in Raqqa, Syria. Turkey wants to take part but won’t fight along side the YPG. Trump will likely have to choose between a NATO ally and a proven fighting force. The UK, Phil Black, President Donald Trump helped create what is so far the most iconic image of Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May    the American president holding May’s hand as they walked outside the White House in January. May later said Trump was ”being a gentleman.” She provided the opportunity for his gallantry by swiftly moving to be the first world leader to visit the new president. May has unashamedly pursued a close bond with Trump, believing ”the special relationship” between the UK and US is especially important as Britain prepares for a future outside the European Union.  May has pushed for a quick   trade deal while also trying to persuade Trump to align with Britain’s traditional positions on key foreign policy issues like NATO (crucial) and Russia (deserves suspicion). The British Prime Minister also threw in a sweetener. She invited Trump to visit the UK with full state honors. That usually means time with the Queen, banquets, parades and gilded carriages. Such invitations are rarely offered to new presidents and it’s proved to be hugely controversial in a country where many disagree with Trump’s policies, including his attempts to block immigration from select,   countries. More than 1. 8 million people signed a petition opposing a state visit ”because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.” Thousands protested on the streets and have promised to do so again when Trump arrives. That could create some awkward moments. May’s efforts to stay close to Trump will likely be judged by whether she secures a free trade agreement with the United States. But they can’t even begin talking about that officially until after Brexit has taken place, so that’s at least two years away.</td>\n",

One year later, Donald Trump is preparing to be sworn in as President of the United States.  So, what is the world expecting    and hoping for    from a Trump presidency? Guest commentators from around the world weigh in. The views expressed are their own. Russia: A domestic win for Putin, When Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, he received a round of applause in the Russian parliament. It was a pure, almost childish expression of joy.  Since then, the ”Russian factor” has loomed ominously over Trump’s impending presidency. The Russian term ”kompromat”    compromising material    is entering the English language, much like ”sputnik” did more than 50 years ago. The American press debates    in total seriousness    whether the Kremlin is literally keeping the President of the most powerful country on Earth on its leash and shaping his policies. More importantly, the notorious hacking story is far from over. For many in Washington, Vladimir Putin has become the main trickster of the election.  However, Russian officialdom was hardly expecting a Trump victory. Viewing the American election as a   game with the West, Putin planned for a likely defeat. Before Election Day, Russia’s propaganda machine was warming up to announce that a flawed American political system would never let the   candidate win. That was supposed to be Russia’s consolation prize. Then, defeat suddenly turned into victory. Russia is beyond satisfied with this serendipitous turn of events. A happy and astounded Kremlin will now try to get the most from Trump    from easing sanctions to making a deal on Syria and settling the Ukraine issue.  It is difficult, of course, to predict how Trump’s administration will address these issues and what the result will be. But this uncertainty hardly undermines the feeling that Russian officialdom has been experiencing: a sense they have achieved a moral victory over the West and its values.  Since the annexation of Crimea, the West has labeled Putin a pariah and a global threat. Yet now, Trump’s win has made something clear: It is not Putin who is a weak outlier before the world’s liberal order. Rather, it is the West that is divided and full of resentment. An outcast yesterday, Putin may now see himself as a major power broker in the emerging global Trumpworld. The least that the Kremlin will now expect from the White House is a display of respect and equality. After what has been presented by Russian propaganda as years of unprecedented humiliation and offense from the West, Putin will easily sell his country’s newfound parity with the United States to the Russian public for his own personal gain. Transforming Putin’s moral triumph into a dramatic expansion of Russian influence on the global stage will be trickier. But from the Kremlin’s point of view, it is probably doable.

His promises to build a wall (that Mexico will supposedly pay for) deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and renegotiate NAFTA turned Mexico and its people into the perfect scapegoat for the ills affecting America    unemployment, stagnant wages, crime and drugs.  Throughout his campaign, we all hoped he would tone down such rhetoric so as not to alienate the Hispanic vote (too much, at least). However, his rhetoric simply became more vitriolic    and more threatening.  So President Enrique Peña Nieto invited him to Mexico, perhaps in hopes that the hospitality and reality of bilateral relations would change Donald Trump´s opinion about the southern border (and awkward facts such as there being potentially millions of jobs at stake    on both sides of the border    if he decided to scrap NAFTA). But mere hours after returning from Mexico, not only did Trump NOT change his mind, but he engaged (in Arizona of all places) in some of his most   rhetoric yet. Meanwhile, in Mexico there was a backlash against Peña Nieto’s decision to invite Trump, forcing Finance Minister Luis Videgaray    seen as instrumental in arranging the visit    out of the Cabinet. Trump lamented Videgaray’s departure in a Tweet.  As the votes were tallied on election night, there was hope that Trump’s rhetoric was campaign garbage and not genuine policy. But in the two months since the election, Trump has reiterated his calls for a wall, insisted that Mexico will reimburse the US for the cost and called for the renegotiation of NAFTA and a border tax for companies that invest in Mexico and wish to send their products to the United States.  On the back of all this, the Mexican peso has plunged, and there is concern that on January 20, the least popular person in decades to be sworn in as US President will deliver a speech that could be catastrophic for the Mexican economy.   Since losing his role at the finance ministry, Luis Videgaray has been appointed foreign minister, and will head negotiations with the United States. Perhaps the President is hoping that Trump will now play and negotiate in an appropriate way. He likely is wrong.   Through his threats, tweets, and speeches, Trump may have left the President and his negotiators with no political wiggle room to sign any kind of agreement that requires ratification by the Mexican Senate. And the chances for a candidate from Peña Nieto’s party will likely be scuppered in the 2018 presidential elections unless the President can convince Trump not to initiate massive deportations and to stop insisting on building the wall. But if Trump believes his ”Mexican agenda” helped get him elected, it is hard to imagine he will do anything but continue to insist on his beautiful wall, deportations and a new and ”improved” NAFTA agreement.

Israel: Netanyahu breathes a sigh of relief, After eight years of hostility and tension with President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will let out a huge sigh of relief Friday when Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.  For Netanyahu and his   coalition government, Trump’s presidency is viewed as a new beginning when it comes to   relations. One government minister went so far as to say that Trump’s victory in November signals that ”the days of the Messiah” have come. That might be a stretch, but for Israel, Trump seems like the antithesis of the outgoing president.  While Obama regularly pressured Israel to stop construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Trump’s advisers have said they will not. While Obama refused to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, Trump has said that he will. And while Obama championed the Iran deal that Israel aggressively tried to prevent, Trump has raised the possibility that he will scrap it. While this all bodes well for the current government in Jerusalem, it remains to be seen what Trump will do when it comes to Israel’s ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. Will he follow the longstanding US policy of pushing for a   solution or will he offer new options for a resolution?  Will he stand strong against settlement expansion or will he allow Israeli annexation of settlements as some government ministers are advocating? So far, Trump hasn’t said much, although the announcement that his    Jared Kushner will serve as the president’s Middle East envoy seems to indicate that he plans to take on the thorny issue.  Like other countries in the Middle East, Israel is hoping to see a more engaged America playing an active role in the region. The presence of Russian military forces in Syria, for example, is believed to be directly linked to Obama’s decision not to enforce his ”red line” on the use of chemical weapons in that ongoing civil war and humanitarian disaster. Leaving a vacuum allowed Russia to enter the country.  Will Trump   the Middle East or will he prefer to remain on the sidelines and stay away from a region that has for decades frustrated consecutive American presidents?  Starting on January 20, the world will begin to get some answers.

On the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, India is experiencing some of the same kind of anxiety it felt when Narendra Modi was about to become the country’s prime minister, back in May 2014. A   Hindu leader with a controversial political past who cultivated an image as an outsider, Modi’s rise to power disturbed the existing political equilibrium in the country, and his election brought with it a heightened sense of unpredictability and uncertainty among not just Indians, but overseas as well. Indeed, for many    particularly the country’s liberals    it took quite some time for the reality of a Modi premiership to sink in. A sense of disbelief and uncertainty has gripped many people here again.  Will the improvement in   relations continue with a Trump administration? How will Indians settled and working in the United States be treated? Will the protectionist measures that Trump is talking about impact Indians living abroad? Will such policies affect the outsourcing that keeps so many Indians in India working? These are just some of the questions Indians have. But the questions also extend to international affairs    how is India going to adjust if Washington decides to revise Obama’s policy towards the Middle East and western Asia? Policymakers in New Delhi are already worried, for example, that reimposing sanctions on Iran would impact India’s crude oil supply and delay the completion of Chabahar port  that will create a new trade route for Afghanistan and drastically alter the trade dynamics in South Asia. In addition, New Delhi is also keenly waiting to see how Trump goes about dealing with Pakistan. Will he continue the old policy of transactional engagement with the Muslim state or take a firm line over its support for terror groups? But there is a more philosophical concern among liberals in India: The potential impact of a close political entente between Modi and Trump. The fear is that the political proximity between the two leaders, who have strong     images, will unleash and strengthen forces inimical to liberal and secular values. Such sentiment is already simmering in India since Modi assumed office in 2014    and his presence has contributed to keeping the   relationship on tenterhooks. Many on the Indian subcontinent see Trump as Modi’s alter ego. Closer ties between them might prove to be a   sword for our country.

Britain: Trump creates a stir, On Monday, the British people learned that Donald Trump’s late mother was an admirer of the British monarchy. ”She loved the ceremonial and the beauty, ’cause nobody does that like the English,” he told an interviewer.  A family weakness for the British nostalgia industry is unlikely to have much impact on his approval rating among a population deeply concerned about the  ’s ethics, prejudices and mental stability. What did get the UK talking was the identity of the interviewer. Michael Gove, who recently left the British Cabinet after losing a leadership election, has returned to his role as a columnist for The Times of London. He remains a prominent figure in Westminster politics and has retained his seat in the House of Commons. Meeting with Trump in his capacity as a journalist, Gove is only the latest   figure to irk the British government by flaunting a relationship with the   outside official channels. Prime Minister Theresa May, who clashed frequently with Gove when they were Cabinet colleagues under David Cameron, has made clear that such freelance diplomacy will not hasten his political rehabilitation. Even Gove, however, failed to match the stir created when the   was pictured with Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, before he had met representatives of the governing Conservative Party.  When Trump then suggested on Twitter that Farage should be appointed ambassador to Washington, May was furious. In Britain, where ambassadorships are traditionally held by   career diplomats, this was seen as unprecedented interference in the affairs of Her Majesty’s Government. The Queen nominally appoints each ambassador and takes a close interest due to her contacts with other heads of state. If Trump shares his mother’s fondness for the Queen’s ceremonial role in British life, he would be well advised to respect her protocol. As well as securing a scoop for The Times, Gove’s main aim in meeting the   will likely have been to impress on him the existence of prominent Brexiteers other than Nigel Farage. Farage has enjoyed high visibility on British TV, his divisive rhetoric delivering strong ratings. Unlike Trump, he has not succeeded in translating that into electoral success, having failed at seven attempts to win a seat in Parliament. He was excluded by the official ”Vote Leave” campaign in the UK referendum, run by more mainstream members of the Conservative Party, and campaigned instead with a smaller, unregistered ”Leave EU” team dominated by UKIP. The   movement in Britain is riddled with personal divisions Gove, who played a major role in ”Vote Leave” will have bridled at Farage taking credit for the referendum. None of these subtleties are likely to deter the British government from maintaining a formal alliance with the United States as long as it remains a world power. But the   would be wise to avoid playing favorites with squabbling British politicians. Serious concerns remain about the future of the relationship with Britain elements in the security services are concerned about the legal implications for the ” ” intelligence sharing system should Trump authorize the use of torture by their American partners. In Scotland, he has long been an unpopular landlord, indulging in an ongoing feud with the ruling Scottish National Party over environmental and planning issues.  Diplomacy by Twitter is not the British way. The Queen would not approve.

Germany: Will Merkel confront Trump? From a Berlin perspective, there is a particular irony in the inauguration of Donald Trump as the next US president. Today’s Germany in many ways is a product of the   War II era in Europe on which the United States has spent so much time and resources over the past decades.  Locking Germany into a collective European order has been key to pacifying the European continent, and has served Germany particularly well. Indeed, the principles that are so strongly rooted in this country are largely tied to the pacifist attitudes of the German public and a preference for an economic rather than a security role in foreign affairs. There is also a strong reflexive support among Germans for multilateral approaches aimed at building global institutions and international law, as well as for the need for Germany to have a predictable foreign policy. But what Berlin has understood from the   so far is that Donald Trump is not really very interested in any of these principles. Instead, his rhetoric runs counter to some of the most formative instincts of the political elite in Germany    and of the public at large. The question Germans have now is how Berlin will react once President Trump actually starts to shape politics rather than talking about it? And there has been plenty in the talk so far to cause concern. For example, just last weekend, Trump gave a major interview with widely read German newspaper BILD Zeitung in which he called into question the role of NATO and the future cohesion of the European Union. Both institutions are fundamental pillars of German foreign policy.  Angela Merkel gave a first glimpse of her mindset in a news conference with the prime minister of New Zealand in Berlin that same day. ”I think we Europeans have our fate in our own hands,” she said when asked about Trump’s comments. By her usually cautious standards this was another remarkable statement following her initial reaction to Trump’s election back in November. When President Barack Obama gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in the summer of 2013, he called for an end to German complacency in international affairs. Developments in and around Europe over recent years have already seen a much more active Germany on the European and international stage. Berlin has understood that some of its vital interests    both in economic and security terms    have come to be challenged.  Trump is going to ensure Germany accelerates along this path, a reality that will have major implications for Germany and Europe. Berlin has a realistic understanding of its power, and where the German government has the resources to punch its weight it will attempt to do so.  But how willing will Germany be to confront President Trump on fundamental questions over the future of the European and global order? Germany currently holds the G20 presidency. That might give us a sign about how much Merkel is willing to say.  Almut Möller is a senior policy fellow and director of the European Council on Foreign Relations’ Berlin office. China: Trump should avoid the Taiwan card, While the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s incoming administration doesn’t bode well for anyone, the instability ahead could begin to recede if the new executive branch is willing to learn and acts sensibly. For instance, Trump has repeatedly demanded ”fair trade”. No one rejects the idea of fair trade, but if the focus is on ”fair” rather than ”unfair” trade, then the key issue is who decides what type of trade is fair or otherwise. As long as the United States does not exit the World Trade Organization, America, like any other member of the WTO, is subject to the body’s arbitration mechanism to settle trade disputes. The Trump administration may renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement or quit the Trans Pacific Partnership, but if it does, it will still be opting for negotiation and bilateral trade agreements with   nations and other trade partners. In other words, Trump may not be a fan of globalism, but he still subscribes to bilateralism and even internationalism. China, for its part, could well live with a   bilateral trade and investment framework, along with a WTO cap. The ongoing negotiation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty is an example. Trump wants ”smart” negotiation, to which China has no objection. But if Trump refuses to settle disputes through negotiation, then China won’t be happy. Still, China is wary of the possibility that the Trump team might try to play the Taiwan card as part of any bargaining. This would be unacceptable    China may be willing to negotiate or renegotiate over trade, investment and currency levels, but it will in no way be willing to renegotiate the ”One China” principle. This is one thing that China will never put up for sale. If the Trump administration can understand this key point quickly, and if it acts in a diplomatic way, then Trump does indeed have a chance to make America truly great again.

South Africa: Trump brings a new style, South Africans in general were more inclined to support Hillary Clinton for president, but that did not happen. Why the support for Clinton? Because South Africans valued the longstanding relationship that their nation had developed with the Clintons, especially during the Mandela years.  Now that the election is over and Donald Trump has won, South Africa    like many other nations    hopes that it will be able to secure favorable trade relations with the Trump administration. Of course, the signs from the Trump camp suggest that the incoming administration will take a tough stance on trade. And though Trump did not single out South Africa specifically for criticism, he did warn more broadly that deals would need to be rethought because the United States is always losing out on trade agreements.  Another issue that might be of interest to South Africans is US immigration policy toward South Africa. Again, Trump warned over the threat posed by certain kinds of immigration, which became a feature of his campaign. If he cracks down it could make it tougher for South Africans wishing to secure a US visa. But it’s not all trepidation. Some South Africans admire Trump’s apparent success with his own businesses. They hope that he will enjoy similar success running the United States. Indeed, if Trump is successful and the US economy performs well under his presidency, countries like South Africa will likely benefit, too.  As John Stremlau, former vice president of the Carter Center, told Africa’s News24, it is still unclear what shape the Trump administration’s foreign policy will take. However, as a businessman, it seems that Trump is determined to try his hand at making deals. It will be interesting to see what this new style means for business with Africa.

Egypt: A lesson for Americans, The election of Donald Trump was welcome news in Cairo. The US   and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   met each other on the sidelines of the U. N. General Assembly meeting last September. After that meeting, both expressed a mutual admiration for one another. Sisi remarked that Trump would make a strong leader, which Trump reciprocated by praising Sisi as a ”fantastic guy.”  Sisi was reportedly the first Arab leader to congratulate Trump, and recently reportedly stated to the Egyptian press that he knew Trump would win as ”his honesty touched the hearts of the American people.” It’s not hard to imagine why these two men would get along. Both are not particularly fond of protecting human rights, and have demonstrated a deep disdain for the press. They abhor Islamists of all shapes and forms. Neither man handles criticism well, as demonstrated by their emotional outbursts. Both admire Vladimir Putin, who has spent time cultivating them both. Overall, they share an identical black and white world view, reminiscent of George W. Bush’s ”you are either with us or against us.” There is no middle way in Trump and Sisi’s world only enemies to be annihilated or friends based on mutual interests. With regards to Egypt and the Middle East, discourse on human rights and democratization will become background noise, as the Trump administration’s foreign policy will likely focus on advancing US economic and security interests. Trump and Sisi began collaborating even before the   assumed office: Trump reportedly called on Sisi to withdraw the U. N. resolution against Israeli settlements, which ultimately passed. Conveniently, the Egyptian media has dropped the commentary from Trump about Muslim bans and registries from its coverage, while equating the   with Sisi a strongman who will bring stability in an age of turbulence. However, almost three years since Sisi’s election, many segments of the Egyptian population feel disappointed in his leadership, as he has failed to bring stability or usher in the era of economic prosperity that he promised. Given time, the American people, like their Egyptian counterparts, are also likely to find themselves profoundly unhappy with their new president.

Considering that there are, by some estimates, around 300, 000 Filipinos living as undocumented migrants in the United States, the question for many here is whether President Donald Trump will be true to his campaign promise of being tough on illegal immigration. As for the about 3. 5 million Filipinos living in the United States, they join other Americans in hoping that the Trump presidency will deliver stable jobs, better health care, and safer communities. Like other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines wants to know whether Trump will continue to endorse the rebalancing of American forces toward the   region. More specifically, Filipinos have two other questions on defense: What will Trump’s policy be regarding the maritime dispute in the South China Sea involving China and its smaller neighbors? Will he uphold the mutual defense pact between the Philippines and the United States? It is not only on defense that a Trump presidency raises questions for Filipinos. In terms of his economic program, for example, many wonder whether his vow to protect American businesses will mean less investment in the Philippines and the rest of Asia? They also wonder whether his call for the return of manufacturing and outsourced jobs to the United States will disrupt Asian economies. Interestingly, Trump is often compared to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Both are   politicians who achieved surprising electoral victories despite their controversial, divisive    sometimes politically incorrect    views.  Duterte has frequently criticized the United States for its colonial crimes and political meddling, even making an unprecedented declaration of a ”separation” of the Philippines and the United States. President Obama chose to ignore Duterte’s rants. Will Trump do the same thing? Will he comment on the alleged American plot to destabilize Duterte’s government? Both are interesting questions. But perhaps the biggest question mark is over whether Donald Trump will raise the issue of human rights with Duterte, whose war on drugs has, by many accounts, left thousands of civilians dead.  Filipinos are extremely curious to find out what happens next. Mong Palatino is a Filipino activist, blogger, and former legislator.</td>\n",

       "        <td> (CNN) CNN commentators and guest analysts offer their take on Tuesday night’s vice presidential candidate debate. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. David Gergen: Pence Lifts GOP Spirits  Governor Mike Pence did not change the underlying dynamics of the campaign Tuesday night, but he did provide a significant service to Donald Trump: he gave fresh heart to Trump supporters and may have stopped the downward spiral of their campaign. Democrats and many journalists argue that Pence succeeded only by throwing Trump under the bus, refusing to defend his boss from repeated attacks. But they miss the point: voters rarely scrutinize debates    instead making their judgments on the overall tone and performance of a candidate. Pence will not fare well with fact checkers, but his poise and polish played well with voters. For better or worse, style counts a lot in these debates.   Tim Kaine had a much sharper mastery of policy but was forced to play attack dog, a role that doesn’t fit his personality. His frequent interruptions didn’t help, either    he seemed less Rottweiler than fox terrier. And by the way, who screwed up his camera angle, so that he was often looking off into space instead of talking directly to viewers?  That wasn’t fair to him or the audience.   With a CNN poll showing a Pence victory, Republicans finally have reason to cheer again. Trump himself should see how much preparation paid off for his running mate. But now it is up to the candidate to show he can win at this game, too: the upcoming debate this Sunday in St. Louis is make or break for Trump.

Sally Kohn: Mike Pence is living on an alternate planet, Well it turns out, if you refuse to acknowledge any of the horrible things that Donald Trump has actually said, then it’s pretty easy to defend him.   This was the main takeaway from the vice presidential debate. Over and over again, Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine tried valiantly to hold Republican Mike Pence accountable for the misogynistic, xenophobic,     things that his running mate Donald Trump has said.  And over and over again, Pence acted like Kaine was not only making these things up but, in so doing, actually perpetrating a campaign of insults simply by repeating the things that Donald Trump had said yet Mike Pence refused to acknowledge.  I’m pretty impressed that Kaine’s head didn’t explode.  Mine certainly came close. I don’t know how you debate someone who seems to have encamped himself on a different planet.  Yet to his credit, Mike Pence dished out his flurry of lies with calm confidence    while Tim Kaine, the   came off as ruffled.   In a moment in American media and political history where the very existence let alone definition of ”facts” seems worryingly debatable, I pray that the American people can still tell the difference.  Or else I pray that not that many people were watching  —   and that the   media will do its job of fact checking Pence for his downright lies and thus the impression most voters will walk away will be one closer to    well, fact.   Donald Trump has praised Putin.  Donald Trump has said it might not be a bad thing if more countries get nuclear weapons.  Donald Trump has said we should institute a temporary ban to prevent Muslims from entering the United States.  And Donald Trump has said Mexico was sending immigrants who are ”rapists” and called women ”fat pigs” and ”dogs.” No amount of vigorous head shaking on the part of his running mate changes this.  Donald Trump has said he would round up and deport every single undocumented immigrant in the country using a ”deportation force.”  Facts are facts.  We have literal recordings and transcripts. But if anything, the VP debate tests the relevance of facts in this election.  Donald Trump and Mike Pence’s strategy seems to be to repeat lies often enough to convince 51% of voters that they’re the truth.  And unfortunately, what actually is true doesn’t matter as much as what voters believe to be true.  Donald Trump has already bent the electoral process, the media and the boundaries of basic civility to his whims.  He may now bend the concept of fact as well.  Certainly, his loyal running mate is trying.   Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn.  She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency. Errol Louis:  Pence gives lesson on how to defend Trump, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence went into Tuesday’s vice presidential debate burdened with saving the Trump campaign after one of its worst weeks. He emerged as the calmer, smoother counterpart to the erratic performance by Donald Trump during last week’s debate. Pence’s skillful performance was, in part, a product of the five years he spent as a radio talk show host, a job that put a premium on maintaining a clear and conversational tone and timing. To make his burden easier, Pence made as few references as possible to Trump, dancing around criticisms about his running mate’s tax returns, insults to a former Miss Universe and the constitutionality of his ”extreme vetting” plans. Instead, he spent the bulk of the night smoothing out what he dismissed as misinterpretations of Trump’s proposals. Even if he didn’t fully answer questions on race relations and questions on Trump’s business acumen, Pence was the cooler alternative to Sen. Tim Kaine, who came off as canned,   and nervous, interrupting Pence throughout the debate. Pence calmly dismissed assertions from Kaine with a chuckle, calling his points nonsense. That won’t eliminate all the political damage Trump has done with his nonstop insults and mockery, but it demonstrated to other Trump supporters how to defend their candidate without doubling down on his abrasive style. Errol Louis is the host of ”Inside City Hall,” a nightly political show on NY1, a New York   channel. S. E. Cupp: Kaine gave tone deaf, unhinged performance,   Just wow. Tim Kaine had one (fairly simple) job tonight: make the Donald Trump ticket look like the unstable one. Instead, for reasons only the late Miss Cleo might know, he was the one who was totally out of control. Sure, he laid out the differences between Trump and Hillary Clinton, hammered away at Trump’s rhetoric and asked numerous times how Mike Pence could defend some of Trump’s words and proposals. But who could hear any of that through the cacophony of hyperactive, ballistic outbursts and interruptions that marked most of the conversation? At one point, Pence mentioned   and Kaine interrupted to excitedly announce, ”I was there, too, by the Pentagon!” When he wasn’t interrupting, he was steamrolling through prepared paragraphs of alliterative dad jokes and scripted zingers that might have been effective    if they weren’t delivered at warp speed. And he was so wedded to his   mandate, he often seemed oblivious. In an answer to a question about the children of Syria    let me repeat, the CHILDREN OF SYRIA    his response was to point out that Trump didn’t pay his taxes.  Whatever substantive points Kaine made about Trump’s unpreparedness    and there were many, and they were important    were totally overshadowed by Kaine’s tone deaf, overly caffeinated, unhinged performance, especially when contrasted with Pence’s calm and composed one. If undecided voters were watching, Pence by far seemed the saner choice, maybe even in spite of his running mate.  S. E. Cupp is the author of ”Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media’s Attack on Christianity,”   of ”Why You’re Wrong About the Right” and a columnist at the New York Daily News. Tara Setmayer: Debate won’t move needle, Despite finishing a bit weaker than he started, Mike Pence was able to successfully execute his strategy better than Tim Kaine. Pence was unflappable throughout, while deliberately choosing to avoid answering any direct questions about his running mate’s litany of controversial remarks and positions.  By design, Pence took every opportunity to make the question a referendum on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s failed policies regardless of the question asked. This tactic forced Tim Kaine to play defense most of the evening.  Kaine was at his best when he listed many of Trump’s controversial statements and then challenged Pence multiple times to defend them, which he didn’t for the most part. However, Kaine’s incessant interruptions were off putting and undermined his own message.   Although Pence emerged the victor overall, it won’t move the needle at all for voters. Vice presidential debates rarely do. In this case, it simply reminded many Republicans how much different this race would be if a knowledgeable Republican who could effectively articulate the issues were at the top of the ticket instead of a   demagogue like Trump.

Tim Stanley: Pence delivers pleasingly banal performance, Now, that was the kind of polite and intelligent debate we used not to watch. Yes, the VP encounter was feisty, but never personally offensive    and its substance also felt incredibly old fashioned. The separation of church and state, a subject never mentioned in Trump v Clinton, was tactfully addressed memories of   were invoked both candidates agreed that Russia is a strategic threat. In fact, Mike Pence’s performance was so old school Republican that he seemed unaware of the reality of Trump’s iconoclastic campaign. ”Yes, I am happy to defend Mr. Trump,” he insisted, adding that Hillary Clinton was the lady with all the insults and Trump was a great and honest businessman. He was defending the Trump of his imagination. Kaine gave a spirited performance that was, to his detriment, wholly negative. If he couldn’t say ”But your candidate said XYZ!” then he wouldn’t have had much to say at all. Pence defused the antagonism with the wry smile of a genial old man humoring a simpleton    and won most rounds. He scored highly on law and order, insisting that there’s no contradiction between acknowledging that police racism exists and refusing to exploit tragedy for votes. So effective was his performance, so pleasingly banal, that many Republicans will be calling for the ticket to be switched. They do so forgetting that Trump’s radicalism deflects but does not diminish Pence’s: He was once considered a politically incorrect conservative himself, and any other year would have been regarded as a risky choice for VP. So this debate reinforced the impression that while the Democrat ticket is weak and unlikeable, the Republican one is eccentric. Pence, undeniably effective, won in large part by not being as bizarre as his running mate. Any momentum gained will doubtless be squandered by Trump himself.

Revolutionized American Politics.”   Jeff Yang: Pence edges    The overwhelming feeling one was left with after the first and only televised ”Second Chair Debate” was pointlessness verging on nihilism. Yes, each debater ”landed hits” and ”scored points.” But the debate will almost certainly have no meaningful or lasting effect on this particular election.  What we saw in Tim Kaine was a friendly, loyal, bland but upstanding (upblanding?) politician who ably filled his role as Hillary Clinton’s staunch defender, but who fell a bit short in executing the other half of his job, as the ticket’s designated attack dog. A bit too eager out of the gate, and nearly edgeless in his delivery, Kaine appeared to be more of a frantic puppy than a partisan pit bull. Still, he managed to come off as both human and humane, and certainly did no harm to the Democrats’ prospects.  Mike Pence, as others have remarked, was another story. Though he came off as articulate and informed, and far more measured and   than his     running mate, he did Donald Trump no favors as wingman. When pressed to respond to questions about Trump’s extensive lies, utter lack of transparency and fractal conflicts of interest, Pence simply evaded and dodged until moderator Elaine Quijano was forced to move on, causing the Republican to visibly exhale in relief. What we were left with was the sense that Pence sees Trump as a stepping stone to his own ambitions that he’s playing for 2020, not 2016.  In the end, Pence may have eked out a ”victory” in this sideshow, but hardly the overwhelming one the GOP accidentally predicted when it uploaded a prewritten Pence wins debate post on its website    before the debate actually began. Yet another sign of the lack of significance assigned to this   and one we perhaps should have heeded.

Most of us have known Hillary Clinton’s running mate as Uncle Tim with the jokes, and Mike Pence as the tortured soul trying to add respectability to Trump’s maverick campaign. Tim Kaine broke expectations, showing us the sharp leader who helped heal his state after the Virginia Tech massacre. Poor Mike Pence was stuck toggling between playing cleanup for Trump’s missteps and staking out substantive policy positions his boss still hasn’t clearly defined.  But the biggest surprise was how this debate exposed the looming cultural choice facing white men in this election. Trump lost women and minority voters ages ago    Latinos, and      not just with his flippant misogynistic and racist comments, but his doubling down in defense of policies that reflect those deplorable values. Yet, Tuesday’s debate drew a sharp contrast between the two tickets, laying bare the choice facing white, middle class voters using two people who look just like them.   Kaine made the case for how white men can back a woman for President, support local police while believing racial bias exists, and hold personal religious values dear while not pushing them on the broader public. Kaine used Trump’s tax record to hammer home that Trump cannot relate to middle class economic struggles. Pence helped Republicans feel their conservative values were still present in this election,  shoring up evangelical support for Trump, but doing nothing to appeal to a broader undecided audience. In a year that has often pitted white families against minorities in politics and in social justice movements, Tim Kaine made the stronger case for a broader coalition of American values.

The veep debate felt much like an extension of the presidential debate before it, as the two contenders on stage focused more on    targets than each other. Both Mike Pence and Tim Kaine hammered at the opposing side’s   president. Overall, substantive policy discussions took a rear seat to the back and forth of political attacks    and personal insults    directed at Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This was a proxy battle, with each surrogate taking the biggest swings at the other team’s presidential nominee. As for the    aspect of it, Pence won the debate against Kaine. In tone and style, he came across as more measured, poised and statesmanlike. Pence also made a much more coherent case against Hillary Clinton    both on her record and her judgment    than anything Trump pulled together in the first debate. Pence had much more difficulty defending Trump’s record, however, as he often was left shaking his head without a response when asked about a specific Trump quote. Kaine was in full assault mode the whole time. His supporters probably enjoyed this, but stylistically he came across as rude, snippy and snide. He constantly interrupted Pence, engaged in so much crosstalk that it was difficult to know what anyone was saying, and repeated an endless string of talking points meant to undermine the Republican nominee while skipping over the moderator’s questions whenever Clinton’s weaknesses were at issue. It’s unlikely the debate will sway many voters in any direction, but perhaps Kaine and Pence’s feisty exchange is a prelude to a much more fiery event coming up between Trump and Clinton this Sunday.

Frida Ghitis: Pence smooth, but can’t defend Trump,   After Tuesday’s vice presidential clash, I have a suggestion for the Commission on Presidential Debates: Donald Trump should debate Mike Pence. Governor Pence, Trump’s choice for running mate, presented some interesting policy proposals to the public. They just didn’t sound very much like those of his current boss, Donald Trump. The most startling of all was Pence’s talk about Vladimir Putin, ”the small, bullying leader of Russia,” as Pence called him. Trump has praised Putin’s leadership qualities and warmly embraced the Russian autocrat throughout the campaign. A few weeks ago, during the    forum, Trump told Matt Lauer that Putin, ”says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him.” Then he went on to rave about Putin’s high approval ratings. That’s the same Putin that Pence claims his team wants to forcefully take on. On Syria, Pence outlined a policy that does not resemble any of what Trump has said. Trump has spoken of attacking ISIS and leaving in place the dictator Bashar   responsible for far more deaths than ISIS. By contrast, Pence declared that American leadership requires it protect vulnerable citizens, including the children of Aleppo. Compare that to Trump’s tone on Muslims in general. Pence did make an effort to defend his running mate, but it was a bizarre tactic. When his challenger, Governor Tim Kaine, quoted Trump’s own highly offensive words, Pence repeatedly shook his head as if saying no, and laughed, appearing to deny the quotes that were almost all quite accurate. Then, when his turn came to speak, he did not refute Kaine’s statements citing Trump’s own words. But then, at one point, he did refute them. Kaine listed a series of Trump insults that all Americans have heard attacks against a Mexican judge, disdain for John McCain being captured in Vietnam, and others. Incredibly, Pence seemed to deny the words everyone has heard. ”If Donald Trump had said all the things you said he said in the way he’s said them,” he said, it would still not compare to Hillary Clinton’s ”basket of deplorables.” Pence tried to paint Clinton as the one responsible for running an ”  campaign.” But Americans have heard Trump. Pence’s smooth debate skills cannot erase that. Another Pence excuse, this one on abortion, won’t cut it. Trump told Chris Mathews that ”there has to be some form of punishment” for women who have abortions.” Pence excused it saying Trump is ”not a polished politician.” Pence is a polished politician. It showed in the debate. But he failed to defend Trump’s policies.

Haroon Moghul: Pence’s dishonesty is spiritually toxic, socially radioactive, When the five wizards arrived in Middle Earth many years ago, the shipwright Cirdan gave his Ring of Power to Gandalf, not the leading wizard, Saruman. Cirdan chose wisely: While Gandalf would rally men and elves against Sauron’s evil, Saruman not only conceded to tyranny, but embraced it. If there’s a reason Tolkien’s ”The Lord of the Rings” endures, it’s because it isn’t really fantasy. It is a kind of scripture. I’m not claiming Donald Trump is Sauron. I am, however, arguing that we can get an insight into what happened to Mike Pence by seeing how great writers explore the effect of power on the human soul. Sen. Tim Kaine repeatedly cited Trump’s most egregious comments, but all Pence did was deny Trump ever said any such thing. We have a   grouped term for that. Lying. Pence may have lied more than Trump did, and that’s a historic achievement.   So whether Pence loses the debate in the court of public opinion is secondary. Whether he becomes vice president almost does not matter. Pence’s dishonesty is not just spiritually toxic, but socially radioactive. If the top of your ticket indulges   moots war crimes, mocks veterans, shames women, and mines Breitbart for campaign direction, then you’re no different. What difference does it make if you’re not a racist, but you want a racist to become president? Donald Trump was the test God placed before Mike Pence, and he failed. That’s so much worse than losing. Haroon Moghul is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy. His next book, ”How to be a Muslim,” will be out in 2017. Lanhee J. Chen: If Pence had been at the top of the ticket. .. Mike Pence delivered a performance Tuesday night that left conservatives swooning and may have fueled the consolidation of Republican support for Trump.   He successfully prosecuted the case against Hillary Clinton, remained cool even under constant interruptions from Tim Kaine, and articulated a conservative vision of governance in the   era.   Some conservatives (including me) are left wondering how different this electoral cycle might be if Pence was at the top of the ticket instead. But while Pence’s performance Tuesday evening will be a bright spot in what has otherwise been an abysmal stretch for the Trump campaign, it’s not immediately clear whether a vice presidential debate will impact the race more broadly.  And over the next week, the Trump campaign will surely be asked to reconcile the differences in policy positions articulated by Pence and Trump on areas such as U. S. policy toward Russia and Syria.   It’s ultimately up to Trump to turn in a better performance on Sunday in St. Louis and again when he and Hillary Clinton debate in Las Vegas on October 19, if he wants to alter the trajectory of his own campaign. And, at the end of the day, while Pence presented very well, he’s not the one running for president.   Lanhee J.

He was the policy director on the   2012 campaign and participated extensively in preparing Romney for his debate performances.  Ruth  : Pence won, but Americans could lose, For much of the campaign, Governor Mike Pence has been treated by his authoritarian running mate, Donald Trump, as a kind of afterthought. Tuesday night, though, Pence demonstrated that he can best even Trump in the fine art of denial. Pence smoothly denied documented statements and actions by Trump, or else refuted the existence of the issue altogether. ”Ours is an   campaign?” Pence asked, as though he’d never heard anything so ludicrous. Most notably, Pence refused to talk about Trump’s racism. Pence sidestepped a question from moderator Elaine Quijano about the black Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina being stopped multiple times by police, and dismissed notions of implicit bias as ”badmouthing” law enforcement. He chided Kaine for ”whipping out that Mexican thing again,” as though calling Mexicans rapists should be no big deal. Pence’s astonishing ability to deny everything perfectly expresses the GOP leadership’s refusal to acknowledge what they have unleashed in America by nominating Trump. It helps to soothe the consciences of Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator John McCain, and all others who refuse to retract their endorsement of this rogue individual, no matter what he says or does.  Next to Pence, Kaine came off as irascible and unable to stop his interrupting and over talk. Pence won this debate, but Americans will be the losers if he and Trump prevail on November 8.

My review of the VP debate in two words: wack sauce. ..like what WAS that?! Two career public servants met on the debate stage to argue about who was more ”establishment.” Yet the challenge? Nobody knows their names. Tuesday night, the two VP candidates had an opportunity to be the chief spokespersons for their leaders while simultaneously assisting the American public in getting to know them better. Early on, I got the sense that Mike Pence laughed to keep from crying the entire night. I also thought his smug appearance, constant head shaking, and outcry that Tim Kaine’s mere repetition of Trump’s words were ”nonsense,” was condescension and arrogance.  Pence is probably wondering how he got here (until he realizes he was not likely to win a gubernatorial   anyway). He kept saying Kaine’s statements were nonsense. His strategy was simple: say everything Kaine says about Trump is ridiculous    pray you don’t get fact checked. Kaine would have one upped if he had said: ”you’re absolutely right. Your candidate’s disregard for humanity and dangerous rhetoric is nonsense    that nonsense has an audience and it has become poisonous and violent.” There were so many missed moments starting with the moderator: if she was fact checking, Kaine wouldn’t be the only one cutting Pence off.

Raul Reyes: Governor. .. please, ”Governor, please.” Those were the words of moderator Elaine Quijano, midway through the debate, as she tried to keep Mike Pence from interrupting his rival Tim Kaine. She could well have been articulating the thoughts of millions of American viewers, who might be excused for thinking that Pence did not know his running mate was actually Donald Trump. Time and again, Pence seemed most annoyed when Kaine recited Trump’s own words back to him. In the ”Battle of the Dads” Tuesday night, Tim Kaine came prepared to fight    and he clearly won the evening’s  . The sparkle in his eye as he landed his jabs contrasted nicely with Pence’s monotone delivery and occasional flashes of annoyance. Kaine pounded Pence with Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns, his murky ties to Russia, and his misogynistic and   comments. Kaine drove these points so repeatedly and strongly that at one point Pence sighed with irritation and said, ”You’ve whipped out that Mexican thing again.” Does he not realize that ”that Mexican thing” is one reason Trump is hitting historic lows with Latino voters? Kaine was fiercely   tonight. He did a good job in laying out the stark differences between Clinton and Trump on immigration, calling Trump’s plan ”Deportation Nation.” He crystallized the complicated abortion issue into one simple question, asking Pence why he didn’t trust women to make their reproductive choices themselves.   Still, Kaine failed to bring up one of Pence’s vulnerabilities    his history of   legislation cloaked as religious freedom. At a time when marriage equality is the law of the land and most Americans    especially young people    support LGBT rights, this was money left on the table. Kaine also missed the opportunity to mention the fact that Pence has accepted the Medicaid expansion in his state under the the Affordable Care Act    something at odds with Trump’s opposition to ”Obamacare.”          For his part, Pence struggled to explain how the Trump tax plans would benefit all Americans. He completely avoided Quijano’s question about dealing with homegrown terrorism, and when asked about North Korea nuclear policy, pivoted to discussing the Clinton Foundation. Tellingly, one moment when Pence did not have anything to say was when Kaine brought up Trump’s attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his   heritage. Here, Pence’s silence spoke volumes. To be fair, Pence had the unenviable job of attempting to do damage control after Trump’s disastrous debate performance last month. But he really didn’t do himself any favors in the credibility department when he accused the   ticket of running an ”  campaign.” The facts say otherwise    ”Crooked Hillary” comes to mind    as even causal observers of the presidential race know. As moderator Quijano might say, ”Governor. .. please.” Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him @RaulAReyes. Julian Zelizer: The start of Pence 2020? Both campaigns will find something to be pleased about with the debate. If Clinton wanted an    attack dog, Tim Kaine answered the call. He took some tough shots at Donald Trump and everything that the Republican campaign has supported. He reiterated most of the key talking points from the campaign, right from the start of the night. When Mike Pence brought up the Clinton Foundation, Kaine turned the conversation to what he sees as the much more egregious and less altruistic nature of the Trump Foundation. Most importantly, Kaine forced Pence into the uncomfortable position of being challenged to defend Trump’s most outrageous, polemical and insulting comments about women, Mexicans and Muslims. Mostly Pence   the points Kaine made. ”I’m just saying facts about your candidate, and you can’t defend him,” Kaine said when Pence complained about their ” ” campaign. But Pence achieved his goal in this debate, which was simply to provide some positive coverage for the Republican ticket and offer an image of the ticket that differs from everything Trump has conveyed. Of course, the bar was low after Trump’s performance in the first debate. Throughout most of the    Pence appeared calmer and more deliberative than his opponent. If Kaine wanted to provoke him in the same way that Clinton did with Trump, he was not able to do so. This time, it was the Democrat who kept interrupting and throwing out attack lines.  Pence was able to express some of the major lines of Republican criticism against Clinton’s policy record, something that Trump has mostly failed to do. He brought in the attacks on whether voters can trust Clinton without letting the issue overwhelm his argument. Pence scored some points by responding to the claims about Trump’s insults by pointing to Clinton’s line about half of Trump’s supporters being in the basket of ”deplorables”.   Kaine’s aggressive demeanor, filled with endless interruptions and jabs, will not play well with some voters. Pence’s statements about religion and abortion are sure to comfort some Republicans who are uneasy with their nominee. Republicans were absolutely desperate to halt the stream of negative news stories coming out about the Trump campaign that has dominated the past week and, in this respect, Pence achieved his goal.   The challenge for the Republicans though is that Trump is still at the top of the ticket, with all the negatives he has brought to the party. With Trump live tweeting insulting comments throughout the debate, the real question is whether this has any impact at all on the polls. There is little evidence that Trump will show any signs of remorse about his style or about his policies. Trump is also in the middle of preparing for a town hall debate on Sunday that will give Clinton a huge opportunity to use her seasoned campaign skills a second time around. In the end, it might be that Pence’s biggest accomplishment Tuesday night was to help him launch a possible presidential ticket of his own for 2020. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ”Jimmy Carter” and ”The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.” Roxanne Jones: Pence is polished, but Is that enough? When you know it’s wrong, just be quiet and move on. That was the strategy adopted by Governor Mike Pence at Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate when it came to defending his Presidential running mate Donald Trump.  Repeatedly, Pence declined to defend some of the more flammable issues surrounding Trump. On Trump’s not paying taxes, insulting immigrants, Muslims, women, business deals with Vladimir Putin’s Russia    Pence was mostly silent. Clearly, Pence does not believe in everything Trump is selling. No matter how many times Senator Tim Kaine tried to bait Pence, he stood firm, opting to defend his own conservative legacy and reputation instead of getting mired in Trump’s drama. Smart move.  Kaine, who it turns out, isn’t just a   nice guy, was a breath of fresh air. He came into the debate armed with information and talking points on Hillary, ready to pounce. And he seemed just the right amount of fed up. Maybe it’s the fighter in me, but I liked his fire. True, Kaine acted at times like an   kid trying to hard to impress us, but at least he wholeheartedly believes in what he and Hillary Clinton are trying to sell to the American public. He believes in her. Unlike Pence, Kaine doesn’t not give the impression that the main reason he’s on the ticket is to enhance his own political stature, or even worse, be a babysitter for a wayward president. Integrity matters. The win goes to Tim Kaine, by an edge.

       "        <td>Following is a transcript of   Donald J. Trump’s interview on Tuesday with reporters, editors and opinion columnists from The New York Times. The transcription was prepared by Liam Stack, Jonah Engel Bromwich, Karen Workman and Tim Herrera of The Times. More on the Trump transition here. ARTHUR SULZBERGER Jr. publisher of The New York Times: Thank you very much for joining us. And I want to reaffirm this is on the record. DONALD J. TRUMP,   of the United States: O. K. SULZBERGER: All right, so we’re clear. We had a very nice meeting in the Churchill Room. You’re a Churchill fan, I hear? TRUMP: I am, I am. SULZBERGER: There’s a photo of the great man behind you. TRUMP: There was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the Oval Office. SULZBERGER: I heard you’re thinking of putting it back. TRUMP: I am, indeed. I am. SULZBERGER: Wonderful. So we’ve got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists. I just want to say we had a good, quiet, but useful and   conversation in there. So I appreciate that very much. TRUMP: I appreciate it, too. SULZBERGER: I thought maybe I’d start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions you’re going to get this administration. [laughter] TRUMP: O. K. Well, I just appreciate the meeting and I have great respect for The New York Times. Tremendous respect. It’s very special. Always has been very special. I think I’ve been treated very rough. It’s well out there that I’ve been treated extremely unfairly in a sense, in a true sense. I wouldn’t only complain about The Times. I would say The Times was about the roughest of all. You could make the case The Washington Post was bad, but every once in a while I’d actually get a good article. Not often, Dean, but every once in awhile. Look, I have great respect for The Times, and I’d like to turn it around. I think it would make the job I am doing much easier. We’re working very hard. We have great people coming in. I think you’ll be very impressed with the names. We’ll be announcing some very shortly. Everybody wanted to do this. People are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks. But they’re giving up a lot. I mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is. But I think we’re going to see some tremendous talent, tremendous talent coming in. We have many people for every job. I mean no matter what the job is, we have many incredible people. I think, Reince, you can sort of just confirm that. The quality of the people is very good. REINCE PRIEBUS, Mr. Trump’s choice for chief of staff: [inaudible] TRUMP: We’re trying very hard to get the best people. Not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct people, because that hasn’t been working. So we have really experts in the field. Some are known and some are not known, but they’re known within their field as being the best. That’s very important to me. You know, I’ve been given a great honor. It’s been very tough. It’s been 18 months of brutality in a true sense, but we won it. We won it pretty big. The final numbers are coming out. Or I guess they’re coming out. Michigan’s just being confirmed. But the numbers are coming out far beyond what anybody’s wildest expectation was. I don’t know if it was us, I mean, we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind of, everything, the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people. As you probably know, I did many, many speeches that last   period. I was just telling Arthur that I went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different places, that were, the massive crowds we were getting. If we had a stadium that held  —   and most of you, many of you were there  —   that held 20, 000 people, we’d have 15, 000 people outside that couldn’t get in. So we came up with a good system  —   we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left. I would do, during the last month, two or three a day. That’s a lot. Because that’s not easy when you have big crowds. Those speeches, that’s not an easy way of life, doing three a day. Then I said the last two days, I want to do six and seven. And I’m not sure anybody has ever done that. But we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 o’clock in the morning in Michigan. And we had 31, 000 people, 17, 000 or 18, 000 inside and the rest outside. This massive place in Grand Rapids, I guess. And it was an incredible thing. And I left saying: ‘How do we lose Michigan? I don’t think we can lose Michigan.’ And the reason I did that, it was set up only a little while before  —   because we heard that day that Hillary was hearing that they’re going to lose Michigan, which hasn’t been lost in 38 years. Or something. But 38 years. And they didn’t want to lose Michigan. So they went out along with President Obama and Michelle, Bill and Hillary, they went to Michigan late that, sort of late afternoon and I said, ‘Let’s go to Michigan.’ It wasn’t on the schedule. So I finished up in New Hampshire and at 10 o’clock I went to Michigan. We got there at 12 o’clock. We started speaking around 12:45, actually, and we had 31, 000 people and I said, really, I mean, there are things happening. But we saw it everywhere. So we felt very good. we had great numbers. And we thought we’re going to win. We thought we were going to win Florida. We thought we were going to win North Carolina. We did easily, pretty easily. We thought strongly we were going to win Pennsylvania. The problem is nobody had won it and it was known, as you know, the great state that always got away. Every Republican thought they were going to win Pennsylvania for 38 years and they just couldn’t win it. And I thought we were going to win it. And we won it, we won it, you know, relatively easily, we won it by a number of points. Florida we won by 180, 000  —   was that the number, 180? PRIEBUS: [inaudible] TRUMP: More than 180, 000 voted, and votes are still coming in from the military, which we are getting about 85 percent of. So we won that by a lot of votes and, you know, we had a great victory. We had a great victory. I think it would have been easier because I see every once in awhile somebody says, ‘Well, the popular vote.’ Well, the popular vote would have been a lot easier, but it’s a whole different campaign. I would have been in California, I would have been in Texas, Florida and New York, and we wouldn’t have gone anywhere else. Which is, I mean I’d rather do the popular vote from the standpoint  —   I’d think we’d do actually as well or better  —   it’s a whole different campaign. It’s like, if you’re a golfer, it’s like match play versus stroke play. It’s a whole different game. But I think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because you’d go to a few places. I think that’s the genius of the Electoral College. I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now. SULZBERGER: Until now. [laughter] TRUMP: Until now. I guess now I like it for two reasons. What it does do is it gets you out to see states that you’ll never see otherwise. It’s very interesting. Like Maine. I went to Maine four times. I went to Maine 2 for one, because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270. We learned that was false because we ended up with what,  . PRIEBUS: I’ve got to get, we’ve got to get Michigan in. TRUMP: But there is no path to 270, you have to get the one in Maine, so we kept going back to Maine and we did get the one in Maine. We kept going to Maine 2, and we went to a lot of states that you wouldn’t spend a lot of time in and it does get you  —   we actually went to about 22 states, whereas if you’re going for popular vote, you’d probably go to four, or three, it could be three. You wouldn’t leave New York. You’d stay in New York and you’d stay in California. So there’s a certain genius about it. And I like it either way. But it’s sort of interesting. But we had an amazing period of time. I got to know the country, we have a great country, we’re a great, great people, and the enthusiasm was really incredible. The Los Angeles Times had a poll which was interesting because I was always up in that poll. They had something that is, I guess, a   technique in polling, it was called enthusiasm. They added an enthusiasm factor and my people had great enthusiasm, and Hillary’s people didn’t have enthusiasm. And in the end she didn’t get the   vote and we ended up close to 15 points, as you know. We started off at one, we ended up with almost 15. And more importantly, a lot of people didn’t show up, because the   community liked me. They liked what I was saying. So they didn’t necessarily vote for me, but they didn’t show up, which was a big problem that she had. I ended up doing very well with women, which was  —   which I never understood why I was doing poorly, because we’d go to the rallies and we’d have so many women holding up signs, “Women for Trump. ” But I kept reading polls saying that I’m not doing well with women. I think whoever is doing it here would say that we did very well with women, especially certain women. DEAN BAQUET, executive editor of The New York Times: As you describe it, you did do something really remarkable. You energized a lot of people in the country who really wanted change in Washington. But along with that  —   and this is going to create a tricky thing for you  —   you also energized presumably a smaller number of people who were evidenced at the   convention in Washington this weekend. Who have a very   …     TRUMP: I just saw that today. BAQUET: So, I’d love to hear you talk about how you’re going to manage that group of people who actually may not be the larger group but who have an expectation for you and are angry about the country and its  —   along racial lines. My first question is, do you feel like you said things that energized them in particular, and how are you going to manage that? TRUMP: I don’t think so, Dean. First of all, I don’t want to energize the group. I’m not looking to energize them. I don’t want to energize the group, and I disavow the group. They, again, I don’t know if it’s reporting or whatever. I don’t know where they were four years ago, and where they were for Romney and McCain and all of the other people that ran, so I just don’t know, I had nothing to compare it to. But it’s not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why. What we do want to do is we want to bring the country together, because the country is very, very divided, and that’s one thing I did see, big league. It’s very, very divided, and I’m going to work very hard to bring the country together. I mean, I’m somebody that really has gotten along with people over the years. It was interesting, my wife, I went to a big event about two years ago. Just after I started thinking about politics. And we’re walking in and some people were cheering and some people were booing, and she said, you know, ‘People have never booed for you.’ I’ve never had a person boo me, and all of a sudden people are booing me. She said, that’s never happened before. And, it’s politics. You know, all of a sudden they think I’m going to be running for office, and I’m a Republican, let’s say. So it’s something that I had never experienced before and I said, ‘Those people are booing,’ and she said, ‘Yup.’ They’d never booed before. But now they boo. You know, it was a group and another group was going the opposite. No, I want to bring the country together. It’s very important to me. We’re in a very divided country. In many ways divided. BAQUET: So I’m going to do that thing that executive editors get to do which is to invite reporters to jump in and ask questions. MAGGIE HABERMAN, political reporter: I’ll start, thank you, Dean. Mr. President, I’d like to thank you for being here. This morning, Kellyanne Conway talked about not prosecuting Hillary Clinton. We were hoping you could talk about exactly what that means  —   does that mean just the emails, or the emails and the foundation, and how you came to that decision. TRUMP: Well, there was a report that somebody said that I’m not enthused about it. Look, I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back. And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious probably, I assume you sold a lot of newspapers. [laughter] I would imagine. I would imagine. I’m just telling you, Maggie, I’m not looking to hurt them. I think they’ve been through a lot. They’ve gone through a lot. I’m really looking   …     I think we have to get the focus of the country into looking forward. SULZBERGER: If I could interject, we had a good conversation there, you and I, and it was off the record, but there was nothing secret, just wanted to make sure. The idea of looking forward was one of the themes that you were saying. That we need to now get past the election, right? MATTHEW PURDY, deputy managing editor: So you’re definitively taking that off the table? The investigation? TRUMP: No, but the question was asked. PURDY: About the emails and the foundation? TRUMP: No, no, but it’s just not something that I feel very strongly about. I feel very strongly about health care. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that I think even the people in this room can be happy. You know, you’ve been talking about immigration bills for 50 years and nothing’s ever happened. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that’s fair and just and a lot of other things. There are a lot of things I feel strongly about. I’m not looking to look back and go through this. This was a very painful period. This was a very painful election with all of the email things and all of the foundation things and all of the everything that they went through and the whole country went through. This was a very painful period of time. I read recently where it was, it was, they’re saying, they used to say it was Lincoln against whoever and none of us were there to see it. And there aren’t a lot of recordings of that, right? [laughter] But the fact is that there were some pretty vicious elections they say this was, this was the most. They say it was definitely the most vicious primary. And I think it’s very important to look forward. CAROLYN RYAN, senior editor for politics: Do you think it would disappoint your supporters who seemed very animated by the idea of accountability in the Clintons? What would you say to them? TRUMP: I don’t think they will be disappointed. I think I will explain it, that we have to, in many ways save our country. Because our country’s really in bad, big trouble. We have a lot of trouble. A lot of problems. And one of the big problems, I talk about, divisiveness. I think that a lot of people will appreciate   …     I’m not doing it for that reason. I’m doing it because it’s time to go in a different direction. There was a lot of pain, and I think that the people that supported me with such enthusiasm, where they will show up at 1 in the morning to hear a speech. It was actually Election Day, they showed up at, so that was essentially Election Day. Yeah, I think they’d understand very completely. THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, opinion columnist: Mr.   can I ask a question? One of the issues that you actually were very careful not to speak about during the campaign, and haven’t spoken about yet, is one very near and dear to my heart, the whole issue of climate change, the Paris agreement, how you’ll approach it. You own some of the most beautiful links golf courses in the world   …     [laughter, cross talk] TRUMP: [laughing] I read your article. Some will be even better because actually like Doral is a little bit off   …     so it’ll be perfect. [inaudible] He doesn’t say that. He just says that the ones that are near the water will be gone, but Doral will be in great shape. [laughter] FRIEDMAN: But it’s really important to me, and I think to a lot of our readers, to know where you’re going to go with this. I don’t think anyone objects to, you know, doing all forms of energy. But are you going to take America out of the world’s lead of confronting climate change? TRUMP: I’m looking at it very closely, Tom. I’ll tell you what. I have an open mind to it. We’re going to look very carefully. It’s one issue that’s interesting because there are few things where there’s more division than climate change. You don’t tend to hear this, but there are people on the other side of that issue who are, think, don’t even   …     SULZBERGER: We do hear it. FRIEDMAN: I was on ‘Squawk Box’ with Joe Kernen this morning, so I got an earful of it. [laughter] TRUMP: Joe is one of them. But a lot of smart people disagree with you. I have a very open mind. And I’m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we’re going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind. SULZBERGER: Well, since we’re living on an island, sir, I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now doing, right? We’ve seen it personally. Straight up. FRIEDMAN: But you have an open mind on this? TRUMP: I do have an open mind. And we’ve had storms always, Arthur. SULZBERGER: Not like this. TRUMP: You know the hottest day ever was in   98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind. My uncle was for 35 years a professor at M. I. T. He was a great engineer, scientist. He was a great guy. And he was   …     a long time ago, he had feelings  —   this was a long time ago  —   he had feelings on this subject. It’s a very complex subject. I’m not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we have, they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. Where was that, in Geneva or wherever five years ago? Terrible. Where they got caught, you know, so you see that and you say, what’s this all about. I absolutely have an open mind. I will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important. Clean water, crystal clean water is vitally important. Safety is vitally important. And you know, you mentioned a lot of the courses. I have some great, great, very successful golf courses. I’ve received so many environmental awards for the way I’ve done, you know. I’ve done a tremendous amount of work where I’ve received tremendous numbers. Sometimes I’ll say I’m actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that’s true. Open mind. JAMES BENNET, editorial page editor: When you say an open mind, you mean you’re just not sure whether human activity causes climate change? Do you think human activity is or isn’t connected? TRUMP: I think right now   …     well, I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it’s going to cost our companies. You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right now. They’re really largely noncompetitive. About four weeks ago, I started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my speeches, that we’ve lost 70, 000 factories since W. Bush. 70, 000. When I first looked at the number, I said: ‘That must be a typo. It can’t be 70, you can’t have 70, 000, you wouldn’t think you have 70, 000 factories here.’ And it wasn’t a typo, it’s right. We’ve lost 70, 000 factories. We’re not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive. We’re not competitive for a lot of reasons. That’s becoming more and more of the reason. Because a lot of these countries that we do business with, they make deals with our president, or whoever, and then they don’t adhere to the deals, you know that. And it’s much less expensive for their companies to produce products. So I’m going to be studying that very hard, and I think I have a very big voice in it. And I think my voice is listened to, especially by people that don’t believe in it. And we’ll let you know. FRIEDMAN: I’d hate to see Royal Aberdeen underwater. TRUMP: The North Sea, that could be, that’s a good one, right? ELISABETH BUMILLER, Washington bureau chief: I just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into Hillary Clinton. Did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation  —   you will not pursue either one of those? TRUMP: Yeah, look, you know we’ll have people that do things but my inclination would be, for whatever power I have on the matter, is to say let’s go forward. This has been looked at for so long. Ad nauseam. Let’s go forward. And you know, you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made mistakes, etc. etc. I think it’s time, I think it’s time for people to say let’s go and solve some of the problems that we have, which are massive problems and, you know, I do think that they’ve gone through a lot. I think losing is going through a lot. It was a tough, it was a very tough evening for her. I think losing is going through a lot. So, for whatever it’s worth, my, my attitude is strongly we have to go forward, we have so many different problems to solve, I don’t think we have to delve back in the past. I also think that would be a very divisive, well I think it would be very divisive, you know I’m talking about bringing together, and then they go into all sorts of stuff, I think it would be very, very divisive for the country. SULZBERGER: I agree, I think speaking not as a journalist now, it’s very healthy. There, and then we’re going to go MICHAEL D. SHEAR, White House correspondent: Mr. Trump, Mike Shear. I cover the White House, covering your administration   …     TRUMP: See ya there. [laughter] SHEAR: Just one quick clarification on the climate change, do you intend to, as you said, pull out of the Paris Climate   …     TRUMP: I’m going to take a look at it. SHEAR [interrupts]: And if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on American goods to offset the carbon that the United States had pledged to reduce, is that O. K. with you? And then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency. There’s already, even just in the 10, two weeks you’ve been   instances where you’ve met with your Indian business partners   …     TRUMP: Sure. SHEAR: You’ve talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course. People, experts who are lawyers and ethics experts, say that all of that is totally inappropriate, so I guess the question for you is, what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things separate, and are there any lines that you think you won’t want to cross once you’re in the White House? TRUMP: O. K. First of all, on countries. I think that countries will not do that to us. I don’t think if they’re run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation they’re in no position to do that to us, no matter what I do. They’re in no position to do that to us, and that won’t happen, but I’m going to take a look at it. A very serious look. I want to also see how much this is costing, you know, what’s the cost to it, and I’ll be talking to you folks in the    future about it, having to do with what just took place. As far as the, you know, potential conflict of interests, though, I mean I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest. That’s been reported very widely. Despite that, I don’t want there to be a conflict of interest anyway. And the laws, the president can’t. And I understand why the president can’t have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of interest, but I have, I’ve built a very great company and it’s a big company and it’s all over the world. People are starting to see, when they look at all these different jobs, like in India and other things, number one, a job like that builds great relationships with the people of India, so it’s all good. But I have to say, the partners come in, they’re very, very successful people. They come in, they’d say, they said, ‘Would it be possible to have a picture?’ Actually, my children are working on that job. So I can say to them, Arthur, ‘I don’t want to have a picture,’ or, I can take a picture. I mean, I think it’s wonderful to take a picture. I’m fine with a picture. But if it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. That would be like you never seeing your son again. That wouldn’t be good. That wouldn’t be good. But I’d never, ever see my daughter Ivanka. UNKNOWN: That means you’d have to make Ivanka deputy President, you know. TRUMP: I know, I know, yeah. [room laughs] Well, I couldn’t do that either. I can’t, that can’t work. I can’t do anything, I would never see my, I guess the only son I’d be allowed to see, at least for a little while, would be Barron, because he’s 10. But, but, so there has to be [unintelligible]. It’s a very interesting case. UNKNOWN: You could sell your company though, right? With all due respect, you could sell your company and then   …     TRUMP: Well   …     UNKNOWN: And then you could see them all the time. TRUMP: That’s a very hard thing to do, you know what, because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world, which now people are understanding. When I filed my forms with the federal election, people said, ‘Wow that’s really a big company, that’s a big company.’ It really is big, it’s diverse, it’s all over the world. It’s a great company with great assets. I think that, you know, selling real estate isn’t like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different, it’s in a much different world. I’d say this, and I mean this and I said it on “60 Minutes” the other night: My company is so unimportant to me relative to what I’m doing, ’cause I don’t need money, I don’t need anything, and by the way, I’m very   I have a very small percentage of my money in debt, very very small percentage of my money in debt, in fact, banks have said ‘We’d like to loan you money, we’d like to give you any amount of money.’ I’ve been there before, I’ve had it both ways, I’ve been   I’ve been   and, especially as you get older,   is much better. UNKNOWN: Mr.     …     TRUMP: Just a minute, because it’s an important question. I don’t care about my company. I mean, if a partner comes in from India or if a partner comes in from Canada, where we did a beautiful big building that just opened, and they want to take a picture and come into my office, and my kids come in and, I originally made the deal with these people, I mean what am I going to say? I’m not going to talk to you, I’m not going to take pictures? You have to, you know, on a human basis, you take pictures. But I just want to say that I am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we discussed, in terms of health care, in terms of so many different things. I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it. They’ll say I have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, so every time somebody stays at that hotel, if they stay because I’m president, I guess you could say it’s a conflict of interest. It’s a conflict of interest, but again, I’m not going to have anything to do with the hotel, and they may very well. I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O. K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can’t help that, but I don’t care. I said on “60 Minutes”: I don’t care. Because it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country. MICHAEL BARBARO, political reporter: Mr.   can I press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things that, for example, were reported in The Times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of Brexit about wind farms   …     TRUMP: About meeting with who? BARBARO: Leaders of Brexit about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to keep, what structures, can you talk about that meeting, by the way? TRUMP: Was I involved with the wind farms recently? Or, not that I know of. I mean, I have a problem with wind   …     BARBARO: But you brought it up in the meeting, didn’t you? TRUMP: Which meeting? I don’t know. I might have. BARBARO: With leaders of Brexit. MANY VOICES: With Farage. TRUMP: Oh, I see. I might have brought it up. But not having to do with me, just I mean, the wind is a very deceiving thing. First of all, we don’t make the windmills in the United States. They’re made in Germany and Japan. They’re made out of massive amounts of steel, which goes into the atmosphere, whether it’s in our country or not, it goes into the atmosphere. The windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies. In other words, we’re subsidizing wind mills all over this country. I mean, for the most part they don’t work. I don’t think they work at all without subsidy, and that bothers me, and they kill all the birds. You go to a windmill, you know in California they have the, what is it? The golden eagle? And they’re like, if you shoot a golden eagle, they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them by, they actually have to get permits that they’re only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year. The windmills are devastating to the bird population, O. K. With that being said, there’s a place for them. But they do need subsidy. So, if I talk negatively. I’ve been saying the same thing for years about you know, the wind industry. I wouldn’t want to subsidize it. Some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things I just said, including the birds, and some don’t. But it’s hard to explain. I don’t care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country. BARBARO: But the structures, just to be clear, that’s the question. How do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president   …     TRUMP: O. K. BARBARO:   …     are trying to influence something, like wind farms? TRUMP: O. K. I don’t want to influence anything, because it’s not that, it’s not that important to me. It’s hard to explain. BARBARO: Yes, but the structures? TRUMP: Now, according to the law, see I figured there’s something where you put something in this massive trust and there’s also  —   nothing is written. In other words, in theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business, which I am phasing out of very rapidly, you know, I sign checks, I’m the   type. I like to sign checks so I know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer button, boom, and thousands of checks are automatically sent. It keeps, it tells me what’s going on a little bit and it tells contractors that I’m watching. But I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that’s happening right now. But in theory I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly. And there’s never been a case like this where somebody’s had, like, if you look at other people of wealth, they didn’t have this kind of asset and this kind of wealth, frankly. It’s just a different thing. But there is no  —   I assumed that you’d have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know. And I was actually a little bit surprised to see it. So in theory I don’t have to do anything. But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I don’t care about my business. Doral is going to run very nice. We own this incredible place in Miami. We own many incredible places, including Turnberry, I guess you heard. There’s one guy that does  —   when I say Turnberry, you know what that is, right. Do a little [inaudible]. But they’re going to run well, we have good managers, they’re going to run really well. So I don’t have to do anything, but I want to do something if I can. If there is something. BARBARO: Can you promise us when you decide exactly what that is, you’ll come tell The New York Times about it? [laughter] TRUMP: I will. I’ve started it already. SULZBERGER: One of our great salesmen, by the way. TRUMP: I can see that. I’ve started it already by, I mean, I’ve greatly reduced the   and the business. I’ve greatly reduced meetings with contractors, meetings with different people that, you know, I’ve also started by  —   ’cause I’ve said over the last two years, once I decided I wanted to run, I don’t want to build anything. ’Cause building, like for instance, we built the post office, you’ll be happy to hear, ahead of schedule and under budget. Substantially ahead of schedule. Almost two years ago of schedule. But ahead of schedule, under budget, and it’s a terrific place. That’s the hotel on Pennsylvania. FRIEDMAN: Just so you know, General Electric has a big wind turbine factory in South Carolina. Just so you know. TRUMP: Well that’s good. But most of ‘em are made in Germany, most of ‘em are made, you know, Siemens and the Chinese are making most of them. [cross talk] TRUMP: They may assemble  —   if you check, I think you’ll find that the, it’s delivered there and they do most of the assembly. JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, White House correspondent: Mr.    —   I’m sorry I entered late, but I did want to ask you about   …     BAQUET: You should introduce yourself. DAVIS: I’m Julie Davis, one of the White House correspondents. TRUMP: Hi, Julie. DAVIS: I apologize for my delayed flight. I wanted to ask you about personnel. They say personnel is policy. TRUMP: I can’t quite hear. DAVIS: Personnel. TRUMP: Personnel. DAVIS: You hired Steve Bannon to be the chief strategist for you in the White House. He is a hero of the  . He’s been described by some as racist and  . I wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government you’ll run. TRUMP: Um, I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or   or any of the things that we can, you know, the terms we can use, I wouldn’t even think about hiring him. First of all, I’m the one that makes the decision, not Steve Bannon or anybody else. And Kellyanne will tell you that. [laughter] KELLYANE CONWAY: 100 percent. TRUMP: And if he said something to me that, in terms of his views, or that I thought were inappropriate or bad, number one I wouldn’t do anything, and number two, he would have to be gone. But I know many people that know him, and in fact, he’s actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know him, and people that are on the left. But Steve went to Harvard, he was a, you know, he was very successful, he was a Naval officer, he’s, I think he’s very, very, you know, sadly, really, I think it’s very hard on him. I think he’s having a hard time with it. Because it’s not him. It’s not him. I’ve known him for a long time. He’s a very, very smart guy. I think he was with Goldman Sachs on top of everything else. UNKNOWN: What do you make of the website he ran, Breitbart? TRUMP: The which? UNKNOWN: Breitbart. TRUMP: Well, Breitbart’s different. Breitbart cover things, I mean like The New York Times covers things. I mean, I could say that Arthur is   because they covered an   story. SULZBERGER: [laughing] I am, I am. I’ll take whatever you say. I am always right, but I’m not  . [laughter, cross talk] TRUMP: The New York Times covers a lot of stories that are, you know, rough stories. And you know, they have covered some of these things, but The New York Times covers a lot of these things also. It’s just a newspaper, essentially. It’s a newspaper. I know the guy, he’s a decent guy, he’s a very smart guy. He’s done a good job. He hasn’t been with me that long. You know he really came in after the primaries. I had already won the primaries. And if I thought that his views were in that category, I would immediately let him go. And I’ll tell you why. In many respects I think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think. DAVIS: But you are aware, sir, with all due respect, that   and Jews and many folks who disagree with the coverage of Breitbart and the slant that Breitbart brings to the news view him that way, aren’t you? TRUMP: Yeah, well Breitbart, first of all, is just a publication. And, you know, they cover stories like you cover stories. Now, they are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than The New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that’s become quite successful, and it’s got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. I mean it’s a pretty big, it’s a pretty big thing. And he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization. Now, I’ll tell you what, I know him very well. I will say this, and I will say this, if I thought that strongly, if I thought that he was doing anything, or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would think, I would ask him very politely to leave. But in the meantime, I think he’s been treated very unfairly. It’s very interesting ’cause a lot of people are coming to his defense right now. PRIEBUS: We have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations. It’s been the total opposite. It’s been a great team, and it’s just not there. And what the   is saying is 100 percent true. [cross talk] TRUMP: And by the way, if you see something or get something where you feel that I’m wrong, and you have some info  —   I would love to hear it. You can call me, Arthur can call me, I would love to hear. The only one who can’t call me is Maureen [Dowd, opinion columnist]. She treats me too rough. I don’t know what happened to Maureen! She was so good, Gail [Collins, opinion columnist]. For years she was so good. [cross talk] SULZBERGER: As we all say about Maureen, it’s not your fault, it’s just your turn. [laughter] ROSS DOUTHAT, opinion columnist: I have a slightly different, but somewhat Steve   question, I guess. It’s about the future of the Republican Party. You started out here talking about winning in so many states where no Republican has won in decades, especially Midwestern Rust Belt states. And I think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of Republican. You had different things to say on trade, entitlements, foreign policy, even your daughter Ivanka’s child care plan was sort of distinctive. And now you’re in a situation where you’re governing and staffing up an administration with a Republican Party whose leaders, and Reince, may differ with me a little on this, but don’t always see    on those views. TRUMP: Although right now they’re loving me. [laughter] UNKNOWN: Well, right now they are. [cross talk] TRUMP: Paul Ryan right now loves me, Mitch McConnell loves me, it’s amazing how winning can change things. I’ve liked Chuck Schumer for a long time. I’ve actually, I’ve raised a lot of money for Chuck and given him a lot of money over the years. I think I was the first person that ever contributed to Chuck Schumer. I had a Brooklyn office, a little office, in a little apartment building in Brooklyn in Sheepshead Bay where I worked with my father. And Chuck Schumer came in and I gave him, I believe, I don’t know if he’s willing to admit this, but I believe it was his first campaign contribution, $500. But Chuck Schumer’s a good guy. I think we’ll get along very well. DOUTHAT: I guess that’s my question is, how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a   Congress as a different kind of Republican. And do you worry that you’ll wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the Rust Belt and people will say, well, he governed more like Paul Ryan than like Donald Trump. TRUMP: No, I don’t worry about that. ’Cause I didn’t need to do this. I was telling Arthur before: ‘Arthur I didn’t need to do this. I’m doing this to do a good job.’ That’s what I want to do, and I think that what happened in the Rust Belt, they call it the Rust Belt for a reason. If you go through it, you look back 20 years, they didn’t used to call it the Rust Belt. You pass factory after factory after factory that’s empty and rusting. Rust is the good part, ’cause they’re worse than rusting, they’re falling down. No, I wouldn’t sacrifice that. To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to be, to love Donald Trump, as opposed to the political people. And frankly if the political people don’t take care of these people, they’re not going to win and you’re going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what you’re looking at right now. These people are really angry. They’re smart, they’re workers, and they’re angry. I call them the forgotten men and women. And I use that in speeches, I say they’re the forgotten people  —   they were totally forgotten. And we’re going to bring jobs back. We’re going to bring jobs back, big league. I’ve spoken to so many companies already, I say, don’t plan on moving your company, ’cause you’re not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product. You think you’re going to just sell it across what will be a strong border, you know at least we’re going to have a border. But just don’t plan on it. And I’ll tell you, I believe, and you’ll hear announcements over the next couple of months, but I believe I’ve talked numerous comp  —   in   conversations with top people  —   numerous companies that have, leaving, or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs. FRIEDMAN: Are you worried, though, that those companies will keep their factories here, but the jobs will be replaced by robots? TRUMP: They will, and we’ll make the robots too. [laughter] TRUMP: It’s a big thing, we’ll make the robots too. Right now we don’t make the robots. We don’t make anything. But we’re going to, I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we’re going to do that. We’re going to have more factories. We can’t lose 70, 000 factories. Just can’t do it. We’re going to start making things. I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’ But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a   . And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they’re choking. I tell you, one thing I would say, so, I’m giving a big tax cut and I’m giving big regulation cuts, and I’ve seen all of the small business owners over the United States, and all of the big business owners, I’ve met so many people. They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I would’ve never said that’s possible, because the tax cut’s going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But they’re leaving also because of the regulations. And I would say, of the two, and I would not have thought this, regulation cuts, substantial regulation cuts, are more important than, and more enthusiastically supported, than even the big tax cuts. UNKNOWN: Mr.   I wanted to ask you, there was a conference this past weekend in Washington of people who pledged their allegiance to Nazism. TRUMP: Boy, you are really into this stuff, huh? PRIEBUS: I think we answered that one right off the bat. UNKNOWN: Are you going to condemn them? TRUMP: Of course I did, of course I did. PRIEBUS: He already did. UNKNOWN: Are you going to do it right now? TRUMP: Oh, I see, maybe you weren’t here. Sure. Would you like me to do it here? I’ll do it here. Of course I condemn. I disavow and condemn. SULZBERGER: We’ll go with that. I’d like to move to infrastructure, apologies, and then we’ll go back. Because a lot of the investment you are talking about, a lot of the jobs you are talking about  —   is infrastructure going to be the core of your first few years? TRUMP: No, it’s not the core, but it’s an important factor. We’re going for a lot of things, between taxes, between regulations, between health care replacement, we’re going to talk repeal and replace. ’Cause health care is  —   you know people are paying a 100 percent increase and they’re not even getting anything, the deductibles are so high, you have deductibles $16, 000. So they’re paying all of this money and they don’t even get health care. So it’s very important. So there are a lot of things. But infrastructure, Arthur, is going to be a part of it. SULZBERGER: It’s part of jobs, isn’t it? TRUMP: I don’t even think it’s a big part of it. It’s going to be a big number but I think I am doing things that are more important than infrastructure, but infrastructure is still a part of it, and we’re talking about a very   infrastructure bill. And that’s not a very Republican thing  —   I didn’t even know that, frankly. SULZBERGER: It worked for Franklin Roosevelt. TRUMP: It didn’t work for Obama because unfortunately they didn’t spend the money last time on infrastructure. They spent it on a lot of other things. You know, nobody can find out where that last  —   you know, from a few years ago  —   where that money went. And we’re going to make sure it is spent on infrastructure and roads and highways. I have a friend, he’s a big trucker, one of the biggest. And he orders these incredible trucks, the best, I won’t mention the name but it’s a certain truck company that makes  —   they call them the   of trucks. You know, the most expensive trucks. And he calls me up about two months ago and he goes, ‘Man, I’m going to buy the cheapest trucks I can buy.’ And I said, ‘Why?’ and  —   you know, and this is the biggest guy  —   he goes, ‘My trucks are coming back, they’re going from New York to California and they’re all busted up. The highways are in such bad shape, they’re hitting potholes, they’re hitting everything.’ He said, ‘I’m not buying these trucks anymore, I’m going to buy the cheapest stuff and the strongest tires I can get.’ That’s the exact expression he used, ‘the cheapest trucks and the strongest tires.’ We’re hitting so many bad points, we, you know, I said, ‘So tell me, you’ve been doing this how long?’ 45 years. He built it over 45 years. I said, ‘Have you ever seen it like this?’ He said, ‘The roads have never been like this.’ It’s an interesting   …     BAQUET: What did, what did, I’m curious what Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan said when you said, ‘I’m going to launch a   infrastructure program.’ Are they reluctant to spend that? TRUMP: Honestly right now   …     DOUTHAT: Trillion. Trillion, I think, was the figure. BAQUET: Because they would be in the wing of the Republican Party that would say, ‘That’s great, but you’re not going to be able to do that and balance the budget.’ TRUMP: Let’s see if I get it done. Right now they’re in love with me. O. K.? Four weeks ago they weren’t in love with me. Don’t forget  —   if I read The New York Times, and you don’t have to put this on the record  —   it can be if you want, you might not want   …     SULZBERGER: You say if, but you do   …     TRUMP: Well, I do read it. Unfortunately. I would have lived about 20 years longer if I didn’t. SULZBERGER: There’s Nixon’s quote right there if you’d love to reread it  —   TRUMP: I know. But when you look at the different, all the newspapers, I was going to lose the presidency, I was going to take the House with me, and the Senate had no chance. It was going to be the biggest humiliation in the history of politics in this country. And instead I won the presidency, easily, and I mean easily  —   you look at those states, I had states where I won by 30 and 40 points. I won the presidency easily, I helped numerous senators  —   in fact the only senators that didn’t get elected were two  —   one up in New Hampshire who refused to say that she was going to vote for me, who by the way would love a job in the administration and I said, ‘No, thank you.’ That’s on the record. This is where I’m different than a politician  —   I know what to say, I just believe it’s sort of interesting. She’d love to have a job in the administration, I said, ‘No, thank you.’ She refused to vote for me. And a senator in Nevada who frankly said, he endorsed me then he unendorsed me, and he went down like a lead balloon. And then they called me before the race and said they wanted me to endorse him and do a big thing and I said, ‘No thank you, good luck.’ You know, let’s see what happens. I said, off the record, I hope you lose. Off the record. He was! He was up by 10 points  —   you know who I’m talking about. So, others  —   if you look at Missouri, [Senator Roy] Blunt, he was down five points a few days before the election, he called for help, I gave him help, and I think I was up like over 30 points in Missouri. I was leading by a massive amount, 28 points. I gave him help and he ended up winning by four points or something. I brought a number of them. Pennsylvania, brought over the finish line. Let’s see, we brought Johnson, in, you know, that was a good one. We brought him over the line in Wisconsin. Winning Wisconsin was big stuff, that’s something that   …     FRIEDMAN: Mr.   I came   …     TRUMP: So right now I’m in very good shape, but FRIEDMAN: I came here thinking you’d be awed and overwhelmed by this job, but I feel like you are getting very comfortable with it. TRUMP: I feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. I am awed by the job, as anybody would be, but I honestly, Tom, I feel so comfortable and you know it would be, to me, a great achievement if I could come back here in a year or two years and say  —   and have a lot of the folks here say, ‘You’ve done a great job.’ And I don’t mean just a conservative job, ’cause I’m not talking conservative. I mean just, we’ve done a good job. SHEAR: To follow up on Matt, after you met with President Obama, he described you to folks as  —   that you seemed overwhelmed by what he told you. So I wonder if you are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job that you’re about to inherit and if you can tell us anything more about that conversation with the president and the apparently subsequent conversations that you’ve had on the phone since then. And then maybe talk a little bit about foreign policy, that’s something we haven’t touched on here, and whether or not you believe in the kind of world order  —   a world order led by America in terms of having this country underwrite the security and the free markets of the world, which have been in place for decades. TRUMP: Sure. I had a great meeting with President Obama. I never met him before. I really liked him a lot. The meeting was supposed to be 10 minutes, 15 minutes max, because there were a lot of people waiting outside, for both of us. And it ended up being  —   you were there  —   I guess an     meeting, close. And it was a great chemistry. I think if he said overwhelmed, I don’t think he meant that in a bad way. I think he meant that it is a very overwhelming job. But I’m not overwhelmed by it. You can do things and fix it, I think he meant it that way. He said very nice things after the meeting and I said very nice things about him. I really enjoyed my meeting with him. We have  —   you know, we come from different sides of the equation, but it’s nevertheless something that  —   I didn’t know if I’d like him. I probably thought that maybe I wouldn’t, but I did, I did like him. I really enjoyed him a lot. I’ve spoken to him since the meeting. SHEAR: What did you say to him? TRUMP: Just a basic conversation. I think he’s looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition and I really, I’m telling you, we had a meeting, Arthur, that went for an hour and a half that could have gone for three or four hours. It was a great  —   it was just a very good meeting. UNKNOWN: Sort of like this meeting. [cross talk, laughter] TRUMP: He told me what he thought his, what the biggest problems of the country were, which I don’t think I should reveal, I don’t mind if he reveals them. But I was actually surprised a little bit. But he told me the problems, he told me things that he considered assets, but he did tell me what he thought were the biggest problems, in particular one problem that he thought was a big problem for the country, which I’d rather have you ask him. But I really found the meeting to be very good. And I hope we can have a good  —   I mean, it doesn’t mean we’re going to agree on everything, but I hope that we will have a great   relationship. I really liked him a lot and I’m a little bit surprised I’m telling you that I really liked him a lot. Let’s go foreign policy, sure. Sure. FRIEDMAN: What do you see as America’s role in the world? Do you believe that the role   …     TRUMP: That’s such a big question. FRIEDMAN: The role that we played for 50 years as kind of the global balancer, paying more for things because they were in our ultimate interest, one hears from you, I sense, is really shrinking that role. TRUMP: I don’t think we should be a nation builder. I think we’ve tried that. I happen to think that going into Iraq was perhaps   …     I mean you could say maybe we could have settled the civil war, O. K.? I think going into Iraq was one of the great mistakes in the history of our country. I think getting out of it  —   I think we got out of it wrong, then lots of bad things happened, including the formation of ISIS. We could have gotten out of it differently. FRIEDMAN: NATO, Russia? TRUMP: I think going in was a terrible, terrible mistake. Syria, we have to solve that problem because we are going to just keep fighting, fighting forever. I have a different view on Syria than everybody else. Well, not everybody else, but then a lot of people. I had to listen to [Senator] Lindsey Graham, who, give me a break. I had to listen to Lindsey Graham talk about, you know, attacking Syria and attacking, you know, and it’s like you’re now attacking Russia, you’re attacking Iran, you’re attacking. And what are we getting? We’re getting  —   and what are we getting? And I have some very definitive, I have some very strong ideas on Syria. I think what’s happened is a horrible, horrible thing. To look at the deaths, and I’m not just talking deaths on our side, which are horrible, but the deaths  —   I mean you look at these cities, Arthur, where they’re totally, they’re rubble, massive areas, and they say two people were injured. No, thousands of people have died. O. K. And I think it’s a shame. And ideally we can get  —   do something with Syria. I spoke to Putin, as you know, he called me, essentially   …     UNKNOWN: How do you see that relationship? TRUMP: Essentially everybody called me, all of the major leaders, and most of them I’ve spoken to. FRIEDMAN: Will you have a reset with Russia? TRUMP: I wouldn’t use that term after what happened, you know, previously. I think  —   I would love to be able to get along with Russia and I think they’d like to be able to get along with us. It’s in our mutual interest. And I don’t go in with any preconceived notion, but I will tell you, I would say  —   when they used to say, during the campaign, Donald Trump loves Putin, Putin loves Donald Trump, I said, huh, wouldn’t it be nice, I’d say this in front of thousands of people, wouldn’t it be nice to actually report what they said, wouldn’t it be nice if we actually got along with Russia, wouldn’t it be nice if we went after ISIS together, which is, by the way, aside from being dangerous, it’s very expensive, and ISIS shouldn’t have been even allowed to form, and the people will stand up and give me a massive hand. You know they thought it was bad that I was getting along with Putin or that I believe strongly if we can get along with Russia that’s a positive thing. It is a great thing that we can get along with not only Russia but that we get along with other countries. JOSEPH KAHN, managing editor: On Syria, would you mind, you said you have a very strong idea about what to do with the Syria conflict, can you describe that for us? TRUMP: I can only say this: We have to end that craziness that’s going on in Syria. One of the things that was told to me  —   can I say this off the record, or is everything on the record? SULZBERGER: No, if you want to   …     TRUMP: I don’t want to violate, I don’t want to violate a   …     SULZBERGER: If you want to go off the record, we have agreed you can go off the record. Ladies and gentlemen, we are off the record for this moment. [Trump speaks off the record.] TRUMP: Now we can go back on. SULZBERGER: I’m going to play the cop here. We’ve got only two and a half minutes left, because they have a hard stop at 2. And by the way, I want to thank you again, on behalf of all of us   …     TRUMP: Thank you. SULZBERGER:   …     for this meeting, and really I mean that. We are back on the record. Maggie, you get the last question. TRUMP: Is he a tough boss, folks? Is he tough? HABERMAN: I have two questions, very, very quickly. One is your vice   left open the idea of returning to waterboarding. You talked about that on the campaign trail. I’m hoping you can talk about how you view torture at this point, and also what are you hoping that Jared Kushner will do in your administration and will you bring him in formally? TRUMP: O. K. O. K. So, I didn’t hear the second question. HABERMAN: Jared Kushner. What will Jared Kushner’s role be in your administration? TRUMP: Oh. Maybe nothing. Because I don’t want to have people saying ‘conflict.’ Even though the president of the United States  —   I hope whoever is writing this story, it’s written fairly  —   the president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants  —   he or she wants. But I don’t want to go by that. Jared’s a very smart guy. He’s a very good guy. The people that know him, he’s a quality person and I think he can be very helpful. I would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians. I would love that, that would be such a great achievement. Because nobody’s been able to do it. HABERMAN: Do you think he can be part of that? TRUMP: Well, I think he’d be very good at it. I mean he knows it so well. He knows the region, knows the people, knows the players. I would love to be  —   and you can put that down in a list of many things that I’d like to be able to do. Now a lot of people tell me, really great people tell me, that it’s impossible, you can’t do it. I’ve had a lot of, actually, great Israeli businesspeople tell me, you can’t do that, it’s impossible. I disagree, I think you can make peace. I think people are tired now of being shot, killed. At some point, when do they come? I think we can do that. I have reason to believe I can do that. HABERMAN: And on torture? Where are you  —   and waterboarding? TRUMP: So, I met with General Mattis, who is a very respected guy. In fact, I met with a number of other generals, they say he’s the finest there is. He is being seriously, seriously considered for secretary of defense, which is  —   I think it’s time maybe, it’s time for a general. Look at what’s going on. We don’t win, we can’t beat anybody, we don’t win anymore. At anything. We don’t win on the border, we don’t win with trade, we certainly don’t win with the military. General Mattis is a strong, highly dignified man. I met with him at length and I asked him that question. I said, what do you think of waterboarding? He said  —   I was surprised  —   he said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful.’ He said, ‘I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.’ And I was very impressed by that answer. I was surprised, because he’s known as being like the toughest guy. And when he said that, I’m not saying it changed my mind. [An earlier version made a mistake in transcription. Mr. Trump said “changed my mind,” not “changed my man. ”] Look, we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and we’re not allowed to waterboard. But I’ll tell you what, I was impressed by that answer. It certainly does not  —   it’s not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think. If it’s so important to the American people, I would go for it. I would be guided by that. But General Mattis found it to be very less important, much less important than I thought he would say. I thought he would say  —   you know he’s known as Mad Dog Mattis, right? Mad Dog for a reason. I thought he’d say ‘It’s phenomenal, don’t lose it.’ He actually said, ‘No, give me some cigarettes and some drinks, and we’ll do better.’ SULZBERGER: So, I, with apologies, I’m going to go to our C. E. O. Mark Thompson, for the last, last question. TRUMP: Very powerful man   …     MARK THOMPSON: Thank you, and it’s a really short one, but after all the talk about libel and libel laws, are you committed to the First Amendment to the Constitution? TRUMP: Oh, I was hoping he wasn’t going to say that. I think you’ll be happy. I think you’ll be happy. Actually, somebody said to me on that, they said, ‘You know, it’s a great idea, softening up those laws, but you may get sued a lot more.’ I said, ‘You know, you’re right, I never thought about that.’ I said, ‘You know, I have to start thinking about that.’ So, I, I think you’ll be O. K. I think you’re going to be fine. SULZBERGER: Well, thank you very much for this. Really appreciate this. TRUMP: Thank you all, very much, it’s a great honor. I will say, The Times is, it’s a great, great American jewel. A world jewel. And I hope we can all get along. We’re looking for the same thing, and I hope we can all get along well.</td>\n",

He said his whole career was about giving children a second chance and it has been so wonderful to see people he has operated on on the campaign trail. Carson says anybody who tells him that something inside a uterus is just a bunch of useless cells has “no idea what they’re talking about” after describing a woman he operated on when she was in her mother’s womb. Carson urges the remaining candidates to not injure the Republican brand weakening the potential nominee in the general election. 5:45: Carson says the GOP candidates are not addressing the “fiscal gap. ” He says he is not a politician so he can talk about unfunded liabilities vs. the money that we have coming back in through taxes and other revenue sources. He says nobody talks about the $200 trillion fiscal gap. 5:43: Carson says he would prefer in general not to have one but there is a reason that the process is in place. Carson says he would have a problem, though, if someone started changing the rules. Carson points out that he has “millions” of supporters when the questioner asks him where his “thousands” of supporters should go. Carson says he has heard from supporters that they will not vote if he is not on the ticket. He doesn’t like hearing that because not voting is actually voting for the other side and giving Hillary Clinton up to four Supreme Court picks. Carson says people need to exercise their civic duty because we will have done our children in if we choose another “secular progressive. ” 5:35: Carson said he did the math, looked at the delegate counts and realized that “it simply wasn’t going to happen. ” He said he didn’t want to “interfere with the process. ” Carson says it is sad that the most common question he got from the international press was “aren’t you embarrassed. ” He blames the media for trying to stir up fights instead of being interested in answers, solutions.

He says they were supposed to be allies of the people and not take sides like they have done. Carson asks the younger members of the press not to be “captured” by those who want to implement a radical agenda and calls on them to be fair.

He also says if we have to go to war, we should use “overwhelming force” and “get the heck out. ” 4:40: Cruz slams Trump for skipping CPAC, but he points out that the is “angry: too: Cruz: ”I get being angry, I’m angry too.”  —   Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) March 4, 2016,  CRUZ at CPAC:”So Donald Trump is skipping CPAC.

He says his son was on the cusp of doing something really good when an illegal immigrant gang member shot his son in the head a day after he was released from jail. Shaw trusts Trump to enforce the country’s immigration laws. Shaw says when he heard Trump talk about illegal immigrant “rapists” in his announcement speech, he supported him but thought Trump was being too nice because “murderers” like the illegal immigrant who killed his son are worse than “rapists. ” Baldwin has a look of shock on her face. Baldwin, speaking to a black American, has to get in her talking points about how “critics” says Trump is a “xenophobe” and has “offended every section of humanity. ” Baldwin actually asks Shaw if he hesitated when the Trump campaign asked him to be featured in one of their ads for fear that the campaign may be “politicizing” his son’s death. Quite telling that Baldwin never brings up the “politicization” concerns when   zealots advocate for gun control. But all of a sudden she cares about “politicization” when a black American is denouncing illegal immigrant crime. Shaw says he has been to D. C. three times and spoken to various lawmakers and “none of them give a damn. ” He asks Baldwin what she would do if her son got murdered by an illegal immigrant  …     Shaw says Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and every other politician have all said they would enforce the country’s illegal immigration laws but have done nothing. 3:30: Bern Force One and Trump Force One on the runway: #BernForceOne touches down in Michigan  …    with a little company on the runway. pic. twitter.   —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) March 4, 2016,  3:20: Associated Press eviscerates Carson’s campaign spending:  The political newcomer, who plans to announce Friday afternoon that he will become chairman of a group that encourages Christians to vote, raised $58 million, more money than any other GOP contender raised.

He says Clinton would not get 5% of the vote if she were a man. 10:26: Trump says the top security threat to the U. S. is always “nuclear” and the “power of weaponry. ” He says we have to be “unbelievably careful” and then Trump says the biggest threat is not global warming. He says we cannot let Iran get a nuclear weapon, 10:25: Asked about what would be the biggest contrast with Clinton, Trump says there will be a lot of contrasts re: jobs and Wall Street. He says Clinton will get the nomination unless she gets indicted because of her email scandal and says Clinton is funded by Wall Street. He says what Clinton did was an “absolute criminal outrage. ” Trump says maybe Sanders is not dropping   because Clinton may be indicted. He adds that she is “being protected by Democrats. ” Trump says Clinton is a “flawed candidate” and will be easier to beat than his GOP primary opponents. 10:24: “We don’t have a ceiling,” Trump says, adding that his ceiling may be 100%. Trump asks how someone hits 50% when there are 16 people in the race and says talk of a  “ceiling” was always unfair. Trump thinks he can win New York, 10:23: Trump says he will never change re: “Make America Great Again. ” He says NATO needs to pay up and then says there won’t necessarily be a “Trump Doctrine” because you have to be flexible since circumstances can change year after year. He says you can’t say “this is my doctrine and I will not move. ” 10:21: Trump says he thinks the GOP is now seeing him as the “presumptive nominee. ” He says people who have said terrible things about him in the past now want to join his team. “Names you wouldn’t believe,” he insists. “A lot of it will be coming out soon. ” 10:18: Trump blasts “crooked Hillary” and says her husband signed NAFTA, which “destroyed our country. ” He says Hillary knows “nothing about jobs except for jobs about herself” and will be “terrible” on economic development. He says Clinton was “sleeping” when she got the 3 a. m. phone call regarding Benghazi. Trump says Hillary doesn’t have the “strength” or the “stamina” to “deal with China or other things. ” He says he will do far better for women than Clinton will ever do, which includes protecting our country. Trump cites Clinton’s Iraq vote and he mentions that Sanders said Clinton was not qualified to be president. Trump again says that Sanders should run as an independent. 10:15: “No, I am me,” Trump says when asked if he is “playing a part. ” Trump says “I’m not changing” and says he is going to “represent our country with dignity. ” He mentions that he went to the best schools and says if an NFL team makes it to the Super Bowl, they don’t just change their quarterback. 10:14: Trump says Cruz is “wasting his time” vetting running mates. He said he thought Cruz was holding a news conference tonight to drop out. Trump says he will have a committee in the future to vet potential running mates. 10:12: Trump says PA delegates have a “moral obligation” to support him because he won by such a commanding margin. He says he is honored that he hit over 60% in virtually every race with three people in the race . 10:08: Trump now taking questions. “I consider myself the presumptive nominee,” Trump says.

Trump says the best way to beat the system is to “have evenings like this. ” Trump says when a boxer KOs the other boxer, you don’t have to wait around of the decision. He says he has millions more votes than Cruz and Kasich. Again, Trump is just rambling on about process instead of his vision for the country. Another wasted opportunity on a national stage when all eyes are on him. 10:00: Trump says he is going to go to Indiana. He is again rambling on about process instead of talking about his vision. He mentions that Bobby Knight is the “gold standard” for Indiana. He says Knight is “tough” and “smart” and “he wins. ” 9:58: A victorious Trump takes the stage at Trump Tower. He speaks before the music cuts off. He says this is a “far bigger win than we expected. ” 9:55: On CNN, David Axelrod says most of the professional Democrats fear Trump much more than Cruz (it’s because Cruz telegraphs all of his messages, attacks and would be easy to counterpunch. Trump is so unpredictable that professional and unimaginative tacticians who have trouble thinking on their feet will have trouble coming up with canned lines for Clinton to use against Trump). 9:25: Sanders wins Rhode Island, prevents Clinton from getting clean sweep like Trump.

Todd says we may look back at tonight and say it was “beginning the end” of the primary battle.  Todd says a Cruz operative told him that they would be able to hold Trump under 1, 000 delegates before the convention but notes that Trump can possibly reach 1, 000 tonight. Todd says if these numbers hold, Trump has a “clear” and not a “narrow” path to the nomination. 8:23: Trump projected to win Rhode Island.

Sanders says he will win in West Virginia and now national polls don’t show him 60 points down to Clinton like they did when he entered the race and the pundits declared that he was a “fringe candidate. ” He says he is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump. He says independents should be allowed to vote in Dem. primaries. “Those folks and independents all over the country will be voting in November for the next president of the United States,” he says. Sanders says he is generating this enthusiasm because he is telling the truth, which is something “very unusual in contemporary politics. ” Sanders says we can’t sweep the hard realities of life under the rug and also chides the media for not dealing with, in most cases, the realities of our lives because they are owned by large corporations. If Sanders wins RI, it will be the third state  —   after OK and NH  —   that Hillary won in 2008 but lost this time.

He says the campaign will get the 1, 237  and says people must have forgotten to inform Kasich that there was a   alliance. On Trump’s tone, Wiley says “Donald Trump the victor” is going to show up at Trump Tower tonight. He says the Trump campaign looks forward to a contest against Clinton in the fall and says her comments about Trump being out of touch with Americans are “rich” coming from Clinton. He cites Clinton’s “Scooby van” in Iowa. Regarding the reported acrimony between Manafort and Lewandowski, Wiley says it’s “much ado about nothing. ” Wiley, who was Walker’s campaign manager, says we ran into a “buzzsaw” in Donald Trump. He says voters are looking for a true outsider and Trump is that “true outsider. ” Trump aide @rick_wiley on MSNBC: “One of the misnomers out there is Donald Trump’s not a great general election candidate.

       "        <td> (CNN) CNN commentators and guest analysts offer their take on Monday night’s presidential candidate debate. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. David Gergen: Clinton crushed Trump, but was that enough? Coming into the presidential debate, I thought that if Hillary Clinton won decisively, she would virtually lock up the election.  Coming out, it was clear that she did win decisively but I suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously close. By all traditional standards of debate, Mrs. Clinton crushed.  She carefully marshaled her arguments and facts and then sent them into battle  with a smile.  She rolled out a long list of indictments against Donald Trump, often damaging. By contrast, he came in unprepared, had nothing fresh to say, and increasingly gave way to rants.  As the evening ended, the media buried him in criticisms. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump? Even so, I doubt she has put him away.  For one thing, Trump supporters aren’t judging him by traditional standards.  They have heard establishment politicians   and   for so long that they crave something different.  They were quick last night to see yet more signs of media bias.  Trump was an angry figure, yes, but he is also giving voice to their anger.  Those who are for him are likely to stick, despite his ineffectual performance.   Equally to the point, Mrs. Clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters.  She has been vexed with the issue of likeability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become concerned about her ability to mobilize millennials in the way that Barack Obama did so successfully.  Her arguments last night should have made voters think, but I am not sure they will make them march.   Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps Hillary did lock up the race Monday night. Trump certainly blew it. But I imagine the race goes on, and the ultimate decision will be left where it should be: with the voters. Stay tuned for the vice presidential debate next Tuesday!

A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and   of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. Follow him @david_gergen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. S. E. Cupp: Trump (mostly) did the job, I had two criteria upon which I would judge Monday night’s debate. Not ”who looked more presidential,” or ”who   whom the best.” Those aspects go to their bases, not the voters who will determine this election outcome: undecideds. Hillary Clinton had one job. She had to make Donald Trump look dumb. For undecideds, it will matter less that he’s a bully or a liar. She has issues with trust, too. What will scare them is how unprepared he is. Every chance she gets to point this out has the potential to add points. Unfortunately for Clinton, she didn’t take many of them. While she pointed out that his ”cavalier attitude” toward nuclear weapons was dangerous, time and again, she punted at opportunities to point out how   and unprepared Trump is. Instead, she preferred to argue his vague platform on its merits. For her, this wasn’t damaging, but it didn’t move the needle in her favor. In contrast, Trump mostly did the job he had to do. To move undecideds, he had to hammer one point home: Clinton is a politician who doesn’t get it. Over and over again, he attacked her as more of the same, out of touch, and a politician who hasn’t gotten it right. He didn’t go after her character or personal issues, for the most part    which voters know well. She outmanned him on specifics and details. But his attacks were far more effective than hers. While Clinton was right to suggest the   get busy on his statements    many were misleading    if I’m looking at who moved the needle tonight with voters, it was Trump, not Clinton. And, Robby Mook, I assure you, this   conservative isn’t grading him ”on a curve.” S. E. Cupp is the author of ”Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media’s Attack on Christianity,”   of ”Why You’re Wrong About the Right” and a columnist at the New York Daily News. Errol Louis: Where Clinton damaged Trump  Hillary Clinton did her homework on Donald Trump in the week leading up to tonight’s debate, and the prep work paid off, especially when it came to his business record.  The former secretary of state needled the Donald’s business record, hitting on   incidents and turning his claim to fame against him. She brought up his handful of bankruptcies, allegations that he’s stiffed workers, his pining for the housing crisis for his own benefit and his aversion to releasing his perpetually   tax returns.  ”It must be something really important, even terrible, that he’s trying to hide,” Clinton said of Trump’s tax returns, turning the tables on allegations that she’s hiding something in her deleted emails. ”It just seems to me that this is something the American people deserve to see.” Clinton even took a step further and pointed out that Trump didn’t pay any income tax returns in certain years, a strategy designed to chip away at the   demographic that he’s cultivated in the last few years. Trump, who’s worked up a populist campaign saying that the government has stiffed the little guy, put his own foot in his mouth, butted in and said ”that makes me smart.” Clinton came into the night    with Trump in key states like Colorado and Pennsylvania, needing to weaken her Republican opponent on some of the things that have made him strong. It’s a strategy her campaign has taken since July, when it rolled out an architect who claimed Trump shortchanged him over work at a golf course. (To twist the knife in his side, Clinton noted that the architect was in the audience tonight.)    It was a tough attack to which Trump will need an answer in future debates. Errol Louis is the host of ”Inside City Hall,” a nightly political show on NY1, a New York   channel.  Mel Robbins: Hillary Clinton got bad advice, As a Clinton supporter, it pains me to say Trump won. Clinton was too restrained, too smart    and as much as I hate to say it    she was too presidential.   And being presidential won’t help her win the election.  She spoke to the intellectuals tuning in she did not speak to the average American.   Her advisers told her to restrain from attacking Trump. She got the wrong counsel and it could cost her the election. Her rebuttal to Trump’s incoherent rants was to chuckle and tell viewers to check in with the fact checkers.  The fact checkers won’t win the election for her.    She needed to take him out at the knees.  We know Clinton is smart, what we needed to see was a woman who is tough and won’t take nonsense  from anyone.  She failed to do that tonight. Tonight, she was nice.  Nice won’t win the presidency.  Donald spent the night sniffing constantly before he spoke. To paraphrase one tweeter: He’s allergic to his own crap.   He lost the   vote but he won the debate and unless Clinton changes tactics he’s going to win the election. Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst,   author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news   host by the Gracie Awards.  Tara Setmayer: Trump kept taking the bait, As a real estate mogul, Donald Trump is more than familiar with the expression ”location, location, location.” In presidential debates, it’s temperament, temperament, temperament. History has not been kind to Dan Quayle’s perceived weakness, George H. W. Bush’s time check or Al Gore’s sighs. And it won’t be kind to Trump’s undisciplined, defensive rants. Trump’s debate performance was a combined rehash of the insolence of his primary debates, the rambling hyperbole of his rallies, with a sprinkle of detail to bolster his message of economic populism. Although Trump scored points on that issue, he whiffed badly when confronted about his failure to release his taxes and struck out on the issues of race, birtherism and foreign policy. It was, frankly, surprising how easily Trump took Hillary’s bait. Coming into Monday night’s debate, national polls were essentially tied and battleground states were tightening. With expectations set historically low, all Trump had to do was behave well enough to convince undecided voters he was in fact fit to hold the highest office in the land. In order to win the White House, Trump needs more moderates, minorities and women to support him. Yet he engaged in juvenile attacks on Hillary’s looks and stamina instead of her failed record. Trump had an opportunity to put Hillary Clinton away and failed miserably. He is who is he is and continues to act unworthy of the office.  Tara Setmayer is former communications director for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,   and a CNN political commentator. Follow her on Twitter @tarasetmayer.  Frida Ghitis: How Clinton unmasked Trump, Hillary Clinton was the closer. She pulled off a victory, but only after Trump looked as if he might run away with that victory in the first half of the debate. Clinton was clearly in command of the facts, but Trump was making the simpler    if highly inaccurate     case for defending American jobs. Substance aside, he initially came across as caring about those who have lost jobs to trade. But Trump’s initial strength unraveled as the debate progressed.  By the time it was over, Clinton unmasked Trump as a con man over his failure to release tax returns and penchant for not paying his workers. He all but acknowledged he doesn’t pay taxes, saying ”they would be wasted,” seeming more like an abusive   than a man of the people. His birther explanation made no sense, and his claim that Hillary has been ”fighting ISIS your entire life,” was as ridiculous as his notion of stealing Iraq’s oil. His denial of the   fact that he supported the Iraq war was a most awkward dance. Clinton’s decision to address America’s allies, reassuring them that the United States will abide by its treaty obligations, was a brilliant touch, a reminder that she was the true adult on the stage, particularly after highlighting Trump’s ”cavalier” claims, which he has made, that other countries  should arm themselves with nuclear weapons.

Follow her @FridaGhitis. Tim Stanley: A technical win for Trump, That was probably the first and last debate in presidential history to include a discussion of Rosie O’Donnell’s looks. As such, it was tremendous entertainment    pure reality TV. But it was also very hard to pick a winner. Donald Trump won on the basis of spectacle. Hillary Clinton’s strategy was to rise above the occasion and let him talk himself into losing. That actually allowed Trump to land one blow after another without Clinton fighting back. She wittily put him down a couple of times. But mostly she just smiled oddly at the camera. She was, to use a Trumpism, low energy. That was a mistake. Yes, Trump sunk to new lows when discussing the birther issue    claiming that he helped put it to rest when he actually stirred it up. Yes, he was barely coherent on defense, taxes etc. There was a   section when he detailed a phone call with Sean Hannity about Iraq. Yes, The Donald was low on specifics, too. But he did have clear themes that he rammed home. After 90 grueling minutes, I looked down at my pad and read back the key words that I’d jotted down. ”Law and order.” ”Country doing badly.” ”Bad experience.” ”Emails.” Clinton’s policies on solar panels and equal pay did not cut through. It could not compete with his passion, his articulation of populist anger. So I give this a technical win to Trump because he understood the format, he blew it apart, and he dominated the evening. But that will alienate as many people as it will attract. Moreover, I’m not even sure it’ll make that big a difference. Objectively deducing who won or lost is almost impossible when partisan tensions are this high. Most viewers either agree with him or with her. And a small minority watched it and thought, ”How the hell did things come to this?” The debate will likely harden impressions, not soften hearts. The impression is that Trump has matured into an effective champion of the working class. But Clinton looks like a   . Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain’s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of ”Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L. A. and D. C. Revolutionized American Politics.”   Roxanne Jones: Note to Trump: Talking loud a losing strategy, Out of control. That’s how I’d describe the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. What a train wreck for any voter who wanted to hear details about policy. Instead, we got Trump shouting insults and   interrupting Clinton, trying to take over the conversation. Shockingly, Trump admitting to the world: He was ”smart” not to pay his federal income taxes he supported a return of ”stop and frisk” policing, even though it was ruled racial profiling and unconstitutional by the courts and he defended his family’s housing discrimination practices against blacks and Latinos, essentially saying it was just something everyone did back then.  Clinton’s       strategy was frustrating at times but it worked. She could, however, show more passion when discussing her policies. On the issue of race, Clinton missed a perfect opportunity to talk more about her plan for law enforcement reforms and systematic racism in our justice system. Still for me, Trump lost the debate tonight. Talking loud and saying little shouldn’t be a path to the White House. Score One for Clinton.

Julian Zelizer: Debate unlikely to have dramatic impact, Overall, it is unclear that Monday night’s debate will have a huge impact on the direction of the polls. The best moments for Donald Trump came in the first half hour, where he baited her into defending unpopular free trade deals. There were many reasons that Hillary Clinton supporters could be pleased with her performance. At several points, Trump was irritated and angry. He delved into some of his more controversial claims. He referred to Sean Hannity as evidence to support his claims about the Iraq War. Clinton consistently appeared poised and attacked with methodical precision. The most effective part of Clinton’s attacks was to connect him to a kind of   economics and raise questions about his business record. Clinton’s best moments came when she attacked him on birtherism. In the final half hour, Trump was mired deep in his Trumpian statements about women’s looks and more. But Clinton’s greatest advantage remains the dynamics of the Electoral College and the continued doubts about his capacity to be president. It is very hard for a single debate to change the game. And it is unclear that this debate had the kind of dramatic moment that will fundamentally reshape public opinion    overwhelming all of the other factors that have caused her lead to shrink. The most unfavorable moments for Trump are not worse than anything he’s done before    and those moments have not undercut his campaign thus far.  Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ”Jimmy Carter” and ”The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.”  Haroon Moghul: Trump lost, but so did all of us, Near the end of Monday night’s debate, Hillary Clinton looked straight into the camera to address America’s allies. She wanted our friends and partners in NATO, and allies like Japan, South Korea, and others to know that we meant to honor our obligations. In that moment, Donald Trump entirely disappeared, and Clinton no longer looked like a candidate for President. She sounded like she was already President. Trump? He managed to incorporate his very large portfolio into nearly every comment he made. Eventually I expected him to announce he knew best how to defeat ISIS because he built a hotel in Mosul. So, yes, Trump lost. But we lost, too. All of us, as Americans. It’s a disaster for any democracy when there is only one responsible candidate running for office, let alone the highest in any land. Trump’s language over the campaign has been racist and authoritarian he has indulged   and winked at white supremacists when he was not busy with plans for mass deportations or Islamophobic bans. It’s not a good thing that 100 million people are watching these two candidates debate, because 100 million people shouldn’t take a   fascist seriously enough to debate his case for the White House. One of my favorite new shows is Netflix’s ”Stranger Things.” Unfortunately, we’re the ones living in the upside down.

Ruth  : Clinton won hands down, Civility went south fast in Monday’s debate. Donald Trump lost his composure early, ranting, interrupting (over 20 times) and sniffing. (Under the weather, or out of his comfort zone?) Hillary Clinton started out soft, playing the grandmother card, but quickly escalated to tough talk and occasional sarcasm. It could hardly have gone otherwise. Clinton hit hard at Trump, bringing up his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, his ”long record of engaging in racist behavior,” his denial at having supported the Iraq war, and his refusal to allow the American people to see his tax returns. In doing so, Clinton did Americans a big favor: she revealed Trump’s limitations. He is simply unable to make those leaps of imagination and generosity necessary to transform from a businessperson to a national political leader. The candidate who claims to do everything big showed the smallness of his thinking tonight. With his   rejoinders, he demonstrated repeatedly how he sees everything    people, properties, cities, and entire countries    in terms of how they factor into his business and personal universe, which seem to be one and the same. I’ll get to Pennsylvania Avenue one way or another, he said tonight, as though the White House and his new Trump hotel are entities of equal importance. Perhaps they really are, in his mind. Clinton alone demonstrated the composure, wisdom, and broad vision necessary for executive office. She won the debate hands down.

Raul Reyes: A sad night for ’Sniffles’ The reality TV star and businessman who loves giving nicknames earned himself one tonight: ”Sniffles.” From the beginning through the end of the first debate Donald Trump seemed to have something going on with his sinuses. It seemed a fitting metaphor for a night on which the usual expert showman was seriously off his game. Besides the sniffles, Trump made faces and sighed. He scowled. He interrupted. He took innumerable drinks of water, something for which he used to mock Marco Rubio.  In so doing, Trump lost this debate to a clearly     Hillary Clinton. Either Trump failed to prepare, or his prep sessions did not stick. This is a debate that will likely be studied in college communications, advertising, and gender courses for years to come. Without the benefit of a live audience cheering his   Trump seemed deflated and not on his best form at all. His constant interruptions of Clinton will do him no favors with women voters. His bragging, in effect, about forcing President Barack Obama to produce his birth certificate will not go over well with black voters. And his rambling answers at times descended into incoherence. In response to a question about cybersecurity, he mentioned that cyberattacks could be coming from ”someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds.” Uh, what? Clinton did not let opportunities go by to score points with independents or moderate voters, reminding viewers that Trump once saw the mortgage crisis as a business opportunity, and she discussed race relations in thoughtful terms. Meanwhile, Trump made truly bizarre statements, such as she has been been fighting ISIS for 30 years! and ”  and Hispanics are living in hell, you walk down the streets, you get shot.” Note to Trump: Testiness is not a presidential look.  The fact that at several points Trump was arguing with moderator Lester Holt showed that things were not going his way. In one of the most notable moments of the night, Trump’s declaration that he had a much better temperament than Clinton earned spontaneous laughter from the audience at Hofstra University. As Trump might say: ”Sad.”     Unusual omissions tonight: No mentions of Trump’s feuds with everyone from a distinguished   judge to a Gold Star family. More glaringly: no discussion of immigration. Whether viewers agree with Clinton’s positions or not, she was able to articulate them in a reasonable and rational manner. She did well, and she knew it. She was obviously ready to discuss problematic issues like her emails. The grin on her face near the end of the debate was evidence that she was aware that she had had a great night. Once you’ve traveled the world, negotiated treaties, and testified before Congress for 11 hours, she said to Trump with a hint of mockery, then ”you can talk to me about stamina.”  Mic drop. Game over. Tonight at least, Hillary Clinton won. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him @RaulAReyes. Jeff Yang: Trump weaved his own hanging rope, This was a remarkable moment in American political history. Has there been a prior event in which a candidate has so completely and remarkably demonstrated his unfitness for the presidency, in character, temperament, preparation and aptitude?  Donald Trump’s   pattern of winning debates through sheer bluster and braggadocio was effective when he was facing a gaggle of opponents, all of whom had similar ideologies but less exaggerated stage personas. But faced with a single rival with clearly distinct ideas and experience and a staunchly unflappable attitude, he seemed rude, ignorant, volatile and churlish. Despite pundit assertions that Hillary Clinton had the burden of proof in this debate, the truth is that she simply needed to hold strong and let Hurricane Trump blow itself out. And she did. Sadly, moderator Lester Holt was a   in the debate. But his inability to restrain Trump proved an asset to Clinton, who spent much of the time leaning back and smiling to herself, knowing that her opponent was weaving his own hanging rope.  Jeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including PRI’s ”The Takeaway” and WNYC’s ”The Brian Lehrer Show.” He is the   of ”I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action.”  Sally Kohn: Trump train derailed, Donald Trump’s supporters like to refer to his movement as ”The Trump Train.” Well, tonight The Trump Train went off the rails. Big time.   Admittedly, to many observers, the train was already way off track. Maybe it started the moment his campaign began, when he dismissed Mexican immigrants as ”rapists.”  Or maybe it was when he attacked Sen. John McCain. Or later, when he attacked a Gold Star family. Certainly, many Americans have paid attention to the media’s attempts at fact checking    including one report that Trump only tells the truth 22% of the time, and another that found in five hours of talking, Trump outright lied an average of every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.   But for those who somehow thought, up until Monday night, that Donald Trump might somehow be qualified to be president, Monday’s debate was a wakeup call. He seemed like a defensive, petulant bully who could only insult Hillary Clinton and America    and couldn’t offer a single solution, let alone details. He came across as not only dreadfully unprepared for the debate, but dreadfully unprepared to be president. Which is the truth. And it’s high time all Americans know it.   But don’t believe me. I’m obviously biased. Believe Frank Luntz. In his live focus group of undecided and leaning voters, just six people thought Trump won while 16 said Clinton was the victor. In moment after moment, the focus group preferred Clinton. For instance, Clinton’s response to Trump’s attack on her stamina scored better than Trump’s attack. And Hillary’s plan to defeat ISIS actually scored better  with the Trump leaners in the group than with the Clinton leaners.   In moment after moment, Hillary Clinton presented a knowledgeable and   vision for how to help working families and continue America on the path to security and prosperity. Donald Trump, in contrast, lied, and got defensive. He was petty and insulting, and then lied some more. Lies apparently can only get the Trump train so far. Eventually it runs out of steam.   Hillary Clinton showed herself to be the kind of person you want in the White House.  And Donald Trump showed himself to be the kind of kindergartner who should have his train taken away and instead given a timeout.  Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator.

Buck Sexton: Trump needs stronger showing next time, The conventional wisdom going into the first debate was that Donald Trump would have to tone it down and appear more presidential. Trump definitely took a more staid and steadied approach, but it didn’t work. His bravado and charm were largely absent from the stage. Trump the showman can dance around policy pitfalls and distract from some of his less than successful business dealings. Sedate Donald had far fewer tools at his disposal, and looked like he couldn’t wait for the     to end.  Hillary Clinton didn’t give a memorable performance, but she didn’t have to. Most Americans expect Madame Secretary to drone on, joylessly, about policy, and wave her curriculum vitae like a club against her enemies.  She met expectations, which was enough, and during some of the actual policy exchanges clearly had the upper hand on knowledge and background. Trump had huge areas of vulnerability to exploit in his opponent, and he barely touched her on them    from Benghazi to her emails to the allegations of Clinton Foundation corruption. He will need a much stronger showing in his next debate or this thing will be over long before November.  Buck Sexton is a political commentator for CNN and host of ”The Buck Sexton Show” on TheBlaze. He was previously a CIA counterterrorism analyst. He has endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency. Nayyera Haq: Trump looked more like Grumpy Cat than a leader, Trump’s glass jaw was exposed throughout Clinton’s onslaught of policy laden  . Trump came into this debate attempting to appeal to a broader audience, so he needed to leave behind the showmanship and bravado that worked for him in the primary and instead carry himself with presidential composure. But his calm voice lasted only 20 minutes and his listening face made him look more like Grumpy Cat than a leader, showing that rehearsed moves just don’t work for him.  Trump had Clinton momentarily against the ropes early on about NAFTA and TPP, but then he allowed his emotion to take over and did not regain his own footing for the remainder of the debate. His heavy handed depictions of America’s problems didn’t hold up against Hillary’s detailed, solution oriented answers.  His snorting asides were countered with some surprising zingers from Hillary    ”Donald criticized me for preparing for this debate. You know what else I prepared for? To be President.” Trump crumbled under Hillary’s attacks on his business record, lack of transparency on taxes, and understanding of   communities. By the time it came around to national security, the contrast in experience was even more clear, with Clinton nimbly moving around the globe and Trump invoking his       he told us, is good at computers    in a discussion of cyber security. Trump’s abrupt defensiveness, especially on the issue of his temperament, allowed Clinton to come across as the champion of those who have been taken taken advantage of by big business and systemic racism.

Bucks County, Pennsylvania, always a bellwether county in national elections, left no doubt which Republican it liked as Trump won big there. The blowout sent new shock waves through establishment Republicans in Washington. With polls consistently showing more than 60 percent of general election voters don’t like Trump, they were hoping against hope to block him from the ticket. 8:40: Sanders getting big crowds, still taking some jabs at Clinton: ”My good friend Donald Trump —  just kidding not my good friend.

We take care of everything. ” Trump says we spend money on our military to protect other nations instead of ourselves. He says we can’t keep “giving, giving, giving. ” He says we are are “debtor nation” and says we have to fix our “broken” country. 7:35: Trump says he loves Knight’s “philosophy” even though they operated in different worlds.

He says he will be trying to make a deal and says he is a “big fan of Israel. ” Trump says he wants to be able to get both sides together but “nobody will be more loyal to Israel than Donald Trump. ” He blasts Obama’s Iran Deal and says “we got absolutely nothing” out of the deal. “You’ll never see deals like that [under my administration],” Trump says. He adds that Obama is the single worst thing “I have ever seen happen to Israel. It’s unbelievable. And we’re going to take great care of Israel. We’re going to cherish and protect Israel. ” Trump says from a “competitive standpoint,” he wants to get the Middle East peace deal done since everyone says it can’t be done. 7:22: Trump says countries will “behave very very nicely” as soon as he threatens them with “tariffs and taxes” at Fox News’s town hall. 7:15: At his rally, Trump boasts that “all the tough guys have endorsed me. ” He says he likes it when tough guys like Iron Mike Tyson endorse him. 7:13: Trump tells questioner that the   alliance was a “slap in the face” to the people of Indiana. He says it was an example of “typical politicians” making another bad deal. 7:11: At Trump’s Indiana rally, he says we’re to going to let the world and the politicians take advantage of us.

Trump says China will have to straighten out the North Korea problem or America will not do business with China and that will lead to a severe economic depression in China.

He says Germany is an “economic behemoth” but we still protect it. “You have to protect yourself or you have to pay up,” Trump tells Greta Van Susteren. . @realDonaldTrump on North Korea: “They’re having a field day with us.

He points out that Fiorina confronted Trump and bullies like Trump don’t know how to react when a strong woman stands up to him. He says a good president must know struggle and can’t be someone who has always lived a life of privilege. He mentions that Fiorina has known tragedy and mentions that she recovered from breast cancer and lost a stepdaughter because of drug addiction. He says you find your character and faith when you are facing the abyss. He says Fiorina isn’t intimidated by bullies because she has faced challenges a lot worse than someone bellowing and making fun of her face. He says his girls love Fiorina and both regularly text her. 4:30: Cruz says Carly respects the Bill of Rights and understands the threats facing America. Cruz says he is telling voters that she is someone who can keep the country safe if need be. 4:27: Many are asking: Where’s Carly?  —   Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) April 27, 2016,  4:25: Cruz mentions that Fiorina was born in Texas and is an “extraordinary leader. ” He cites her resume and mention that she was the first female CEO in history of a Fortune 20 company. He says Fiorina is “brilliant and capable” yet experienced the “hardscrabble world” of being a woman professional that “extracts a price. ” He says Fiorina has “shattered glass ceilings” over and over again. 4:23: Cruz announces Fiorina as his running mate: Cruz: ”If I am nominated to be POTUS, I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee Carly Fiorina”  —   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) April 27, 2016,  4:14: In Indiana, Cruz says elections are about choices and the Republican Party faces a choice today. He says Indiana and America want to unite behind a positive and   campaign based on real policy solutions. He says the American people deserve a real choice in November, “a choice and not an echo. ” Cruz says one of the “most solemn” choices a candidate makes is selecting a running mate. He says you are telling the American people that “this is an individual you can trust to lead this country no matter what might happen. ” He says any responsible candidate for president will have spent much time assessing candidates, thinking through the pros and cons, praying about it, and examine the potential candidates. He says the characteristics you look for in a vice president are the same ones  you look for in a president. He cites knowledge, judgment, and character. 4:08: Cruz about to make Fiorina announcement in Indiana: Still some empty chairs as @tedcruz is scheduled to announce @CarlyFiorina as his vp pick in Indianapolis. pic. twitter.   —   Terrence Dopp (@tdopp) April 27, 2016,  3:55: Report: At least 35 of the 54 unbound delegates in PA will back Trump. 3:51: On CNN, Bobby Plump, the   Jimmy Chitwood who inspired the Hoosiers movies, says he has never ever heard of a basketball hoop referred to as a “ring. ” He also says there will be a lot of conversation in Indiana about Bobby Knight’s endorsement of Trump. He says there is “no in between” with Trump and Knight so they fit each other and they are “two of the same kinds of people” who “say what they think. ” He says the publicity is going to be “great” for Trump across the state. “In Indiana, when you talk about basketball, you’re going to get everybody involved in it,” he says. 3:45: Cruz claims Trump’s foreign policy speech “is the most dramatic evidence thus far that Donald Trump fails the presidential test” and says Trump is “now the foreign policy candidate of the Washington lobbyists. ” 3:35: Team Kasich: Reaction to   announcement will be “collective shrug. ” Kasich camp reax to Cruz picking Fiorina: comms director Mike Schrimpf says most Repubs ”will meet this decision w a collective shrug”  —   Cassie Spodak (@CassieSpodak) April 27, 2016,  3:30: Media elite “misunderestimated” George W.

First, many of Cruz’s “New York values” criticisms of Trump can be leveled at Fiorina. So, Cruz can’t effectively criticize Trump for not having core conservative values after picking Fiorina, whose one note candidacy didn’t resonate because conservative grassroots voters have never trusted her as one of them. Second, should Cruz somehow win the nomination, Democrats would eviscerate her as the female Mitt Romney. The Cruz campaign will be on the defensive throughout the election cycle and pieces of Fiorina’s business record will be like batting practice pitches that Hillary Clinton will knock out of the park on a daily basis in an election cycle in which Americans are revolting against political and Wall Street fat cats who put their interests above the country’s and their workers. In a nutshell, Fiorina’s record at Hewlett Packard will neutralize all of Clinton’s vulnerabilities re: establishment cronyism. 3:05: Trump agrees with Fiorina that Cruz is a “typical political” who will say whatever it takes to get elected.

He said Trump’s foreign policy speech will resonate with Americans even though the Washington elite will probably hate it.   2:35: Gingrich predicts the shallow Washington elites would mock Trump’s speech. Predictably, many like the Washington Post‘s vacuous Chris Cillizza, who wouldn’t be able to discuss foreign policy matters in depth with experts, do mock him. The mainstream media only want Trump to give more specifics so they and their “experts” can spend weeks tearing apart whatever “specifics” Trump lays out. It’s a game Trump can’t win and he is better off not tipping his hand and giving specifics and instead promising to Americans that all of his foreign policy decisions will put America —  and American workers —  first.   This was a serious foreign policy speech by Trump. It is worth reading and thinking about. It will be ridiculed by Washington elites.  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) April 27, 2016,  Elites have to attack Trump’s foreign policy speech because he is challenging their core values and failures.

       "        <td> (CNN) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump met Wednesday for their final debate, and CNN’s Reality Check Team spent the night analyzing their claims.  The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate and selected key statements from both candidates, rating them true mostly true true, but misleading false or it’s complicated.  Supreme Court, Reality Check: Trump on Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s remarks, By Kate Grise, CNN, Trump called out the Supreme Court justice for her criticism of his candidacy. ”Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent and she was forced to apologize,” he said. ”And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.” Reality Check Quick Takes: Have allegations against Trump been debunked? Ginsburg called Trump a ”faker” in a July 11 interview with CNN. ”He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment,” Ginsburg said. ”He really has an ego . .. How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.” ”At first I thought it was funny,” she said. ”To think that there’s a possibility that he could be president.” Early that same week, Ginsburg also told The Associated Press that if Trump won the presidency, ”I don’t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs.” She also told The New York Times, ”I can’t imagine what this place would be    I can’t imagine what the country would be    with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be    I don’t even want to contemplate that.” Ginsburg later said she regretted the remarks. ”On reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were   and I regret making them,” Ginsburg said in a statement. ”Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future, I will be more circumspect.” We rate Trump’s claim true. Reality Check: Trump justices would overrule Roe v. Wade ’automatically’ By Steve Vladeck, CNN, Trump’s claim that the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade would be overruled by justices he would appoint to the Supreme Court ”automatically” is belied by history. Although Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush appointed justices who they believed would overrule the 1973 decision recognizing a woman’s constitutional right to choose an abortion, three of those appointees    Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter    famously voted to preserve the Roe decision in 1992. Even if a President Trump were only to appoint ” ” justices, there is simply no way to ensure that any particular decision, including Roe, would be ”automatically” overruled. Verdict: False. Immigration, Reality Check: Clinton ’fought for the wall,’ Trump claims, By Theodore Schleifer, CNN, Trump thundered that Clinton ”fought for the wall in 2006.” Clinton did indeed support a border barrier in 2006    she voted for George W. Bush’s Secure Fence Act, which paved the way for 700 miles of security along the southern border. But as the name implies, it was a ”fence,” not a wall. It’s unclear if that is still an official campaign position. Her position on immigration reform, as listed on her website, says close to little about how she would secure the border. Confronted by Latino anchor Jorge Ramos about the difference about her position and Trump’s, Clinton said in January. ”We do need to have secure borders, and what that will take is a combination of technology and physical barriers,” she told him. ”But you want a wall, then,” Ramos replied. ”I voted for border security    and some of it was a fence, I don’t think we ever called it a wall,” she replied, before conceding: ”Maybe in some cases it was a wall.” The difference is largely semantic    both are physical barriers that prevent people from crossing. But Trump isn’t entirely accurate. Verdict: True, but misleading. Reality Check: Clinton says undocumented workers pay more income tax than Trump, By Amy Gallagher, CNN, Talking about taxes, Clinton again maligned Trump for not paying income tax and went on to say ”half of all immigrants, undocumented immigrants in our country actually pay federal income tax. We have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.” Is this true? According to CNN’s own reporting based on government statistics, undocumented immigrants do pay taxes, both payroll taxes, such as social security tax and income tax. In fact, the government itself found that ”50% to 75% of the about 11 million unauthorized US immigrants file and pay income taxes each year.”   So the first part of her claim is true, and might even be an understatement. From the little we’ve seen of Trump’s tax returns, it appears possible that he has paid no income taxes since 1995. He hasn’t denied the specific accusation, though he made it clear that he pays other kinds of taxes.   Given what we know, we’ll rate Clinton’s claim true. Syrian refugees, Reality Check: Trump says Obama admitted thousands of Syrians, By Laura Koran, CNN, Trump claimed that President Barack Obama has admitted ”thousands and thousands” of Syrians, adding, ”they have no idea where they come from.” Let’s break this claim down. The Obama administration amended its refugee quotas for the 2016 fiscal year in response to the growing migrant crisis, paving the way for at least 10, 000 Syrian refugees into the US. They ended the fiscal year at the end of September having admitted more than 12, 500 Syrians as part of this increase. The administration called for a further increase in the overall refugee admissions quota for the 2017 fiscal year, from 85, 000 to 110, 000. Officials have not offered a specific goal for Syrians, but plan to admit 40, 000 refugees from the geographic region that includes Syria. There is also an ”unallocated reserve” of 14, 000 the administration can use to adjust admissions for populations facing the greatest need, which this administration (or more likely the next one) could use to increase the number of Syrians. The second part of Trump’s claim suggests the US does not know the identities of the refugees who are entering the country. Administration officials have called the vetting process for refugees ”the most stringent” applied to any group of people entering the country. The process includes biometric and biographical checks involving officials from the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department, the National Counterterrorism Center and the FBI. The process is made more complicated by the fact that the administration doesn’t have a diplomatic relationship with the Syrian government and therefore isn’t able to verify some details about applicants on the ground. Obama’s own FBI director, James Comey, acknowledged the issue, saying last year, ”If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them.” But officials involved in the process insist the vetting process is a holistic one, and the interagency team takes advantage of a host of tools to verify applicants’ identities and their suitability to be relocated to the US. Verdict: The first part of Trump’s claim is true. The Obama administration has already admitted well over 10, 000 Syrian refugees and has put forward a plan that would allow for the admission of thousands more. The second part of his claim is false. Refugees undergo a vetting process that can take over 12 months to verify their identities. Guns, Reality Check: Trump and Clinton on Second Amendment, By Lisa Rose, CNN, During a discussion about gun rights and the Supreme Court, Trump said Clinton intends to nominate justices who would ”dismantle” the Second Amendment. To illustrate his point, he referenced comments Clinton and her advisers have made about a landmark case that overturned a handgun ban in Washington, DC. Trump claimed Clinton was ”upset” by the D. C. v. Heller decision, which reinforced the right for individuals to own firearms but included the caveat that gun rights aren’t absolute. Clinton responded that she was upset about one portion of the   ruling, which overturned Washington’s handgun ban and its safe storage law, requiring firearms to be kept in safes or locked boxes to prevent accidents. ”I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case,” said Clinton. ”Because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from getting guns. They wanted people with guns to safely store them and the court did not accept that reasonable regulation.” Although Clinton said she objected to one narrow sliver of the D. C. v. Heller decision during the debate, she expressed broader opposition to the ruling in a Bloomberg Politics article published last spring. ”Clinton believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe, like safe storage laws to prevent toddlers from accessing guns,” said Maya Harris, a policy adviser to Clinton, in a statement emailed to Bloomberg. ”In overturning Washington DC’s safe storage law, Clinton worries that Heller may open the door to overturning thoughtful, common sense safety measures in the future.” In a recording leaked from a private fundraiser last year, Clinton said, more broadly, ”The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment” while talking about the case.   Because Clinton has said that she thought the high court erred in D. C. v. Heller, we rate Trump’s claim true. We rate Clinton’s claim as true, but misleading. During the debate, she said she opposed one part of the ruling but her past comments suggest she feels the whole case was wrongly decided. Reality Check: Trump on Chicago’s gun laws, By Sonam Vashi, CNN, When moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump why he opposed any limits on assault weapons or   magazines, Trump said: ”Well, let me tell you before we go any further, in Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.” Trump and other Republicans have often cited Chicago as having some of the strictest gun laws in the country.  But while Chicago was once tough on guns, courts and gun rights advocates have overturned much of the legislation. The Supreme Court reversed Chicago’s handgun ban in 2010, a federal appeals court toppled the Illinois concealed carry ban in 2012 and Chicago began allowing gun stores in the city in 2014 for the first time in years after gun rights proponents pressured the city, according to the Chicago Tribune.  So while Chicago does have tough gun regulations, they are not necessarily the toughest in the nation anymore. Chicago does see extreme raw numbers of gun violence, more than the rest of the country, although that’s affected by the city having a larger population than many other cities. Additionally, the Chicago Police Department says it recovers more guns than any other city in the nation. That situation is affected by other states around Chicago 60% of recovered guns in Chicago from 2009 to 2013 were first sold outside of Illinois, in states with softer gun laws, according to a 2014 report from the Chicago’s mayor’s office. CPD authorities say violence in the city is often fueled by repeat offenders. And even when people who commit gun crimes are convicted,   judges do not often give harsh sentences. In 2014, the Chicago   analyzed Cook County convictions for illegal gun possession and found that most defendants received the minimum sentence    one year. That time didn’t even count early releases of prisoners under good behavior laws. Trump is arguing that regulations like bans on assault rifles won’t necessarily reduce gun violence, because Chicago’s tough laws haven’t stopped its gun violence. But using Chicago as an example doesn’t work: its regulations have been scaled back, its gun violence is affected by more lenient laws in other states and its punishments are not always tough on gun crime, potentially enabling repeat offenders.  Trump’s correlation between gun regulation effectiveness and Chicago’s gun violence is egregiously misleading, making his claim false. Reality Check: Clinton on 33, 000 gun deaths annually, By Ali Foreman, CNN, ”We have 33, 000 people a year who die from guns,” Clinton claimed. Her claim is in line with not only statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (which reported 33, 599 people killed by firearms in 2014) but also the rhetoric of her primary campaigning. In a February debate against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton said, ”On average, 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country.”  While Clinton’s figures are correct    the CDC’s reported number rounds to about 92   deaths a day    the context provided in Wednesday night’s debate misses the mark.   She expanded upon the statistic, saying, ”I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole . .. I see no conflict between saving people’s lives and defending the Second Amendment.”  Clinton’s use of this figure in support of gun control gives the impression that 33, 000 Americans are violently killed by firearms each year. As we pointed out in February, the CDC’s statistic encompasses many types of   deaths    not only violent, intentional encounters.   In addition to the 11, 409 individuals killed as a result of gun violence (homicide and legal intervention) that 33, 599 also includes suicides, unintentional deaths, and incidents with undetermined intent.  For this reason, we will rate Clinton’s claim for a second time true, but misleading. Nuclear proliferation, Reality Check: Trump claims he doesn’t support nuclear proliferation, By Kevin Liptak, CNN, Clinton and Trump sparred over the Republican candidate’s statements about nuclear weapons. Clinton claimed Trump had been ”very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons,” an assertion Trump interjected to claim was ”wrong.” The Democratic candidate continued: ”He’s advocated more countries getting them. Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.” Trump disputed the characterization of his stance: ”There’s no quote. You’ll not find a quote from me,” he said, saying he advocated countries taking steps to defend themselves, but ”didn’t say nuclear.” Over the course of his campaign, Trump has taken different and convoluted stances on nuclear proliferation. He suggested to The New York Times on March 27 that because North Korea has nuclear capabilities, Japan should develop a comparable defense. ”If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us,” he said then. Pressed in various CNN interviews since then, Trump expressed a similar stance. He told Anderson Cooper on March 29: ”Wouldn’t you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?” And when Wolf Blitzer asked in May whether Trump was ”ready to let Japan and South Korea become nuclear powers,” Trump answered affirmatively. ”I am prepared to, if they’re not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and police for the world,” he said. But he’s also expressed a general opposition to the spread of nuclear weapons, telling CNN in March, ”I hate nuclear more than any” and ”I don’t want more nuclear weapons.” Ultimately, Trump is on the record expressing support, at least in the hypothetical, for countries that currently don’t have nuclear weapons eventually obtaining them. Verdict: False. Abortion, Reality Check: Trump on Clinton allowing abortions ’two or three or four days prior to birth’ By Ben Tinker, CNN, When asked by moderator Chris Wallace about   abortion, Trump responded, ”If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take a baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that’s OK and Hillary can say that that’s OK, but it’s not OK with me. Because based on what she is saying, and based on where she’s going and where she’s been, you can take a baby and rip the baby out of the womb. In the ninth month, on the final day and that’s not acceptable.” While Clinton has said she believes a fetus lacks constitutional rights, she did vote against a ban on   abortions in 2003 while serving as a senator from New York. ”The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make,” Clinton said in the debate Wednesday night.  ”I have met with women who have, toward the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news one can get    that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term, or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.”  Roe v. Wade, decided by the Supreme Court in 1973, made abortions legal during the entire term of a pregnancy, but put restrictions on the procedure during the second and third trimesters.  Clinton does believe mothers should be allowed to terminate a pregnancy at any point    up until birth    if her life is in danger, but abortions as late in a pregnancy as Trump suggests are almost unheard of.  We therefore rate Trump’s claim as true, but misleading. Clinton’s State Department, Reality Check: Trump says $6 billion went missing from the State Department, By Laura Koran, CNN, Attacking Clinton’s leadership credentials, Trump claimed that $6 billion went missing from the State Department during her tenure as secretary of state, possibly stolen. ”How do you miss $6 billion?” he asked incredulously. Trump has made this allegation at several recent rallies, but its origins are murky. The conservative news website the Daily Caller reported on this apparent missing cash in August, having obtained a copy of a Freedom of Information Act request from the conservative government watchdog group Cause of Action Group. The Cause of Action request, submitted to the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) asserts that the State Department lost contract files worth over $6 billion. A footnote to the request shows they arrived at that figure by reading a management alert written by the State Department OIG in March 2014, which noted, ”significant vulnerabilities in the management of contract file documentation that could expose the Department to substantial financial losses.” ”Specifically, over the past six years, OIG has identified Department of State (Department) contracts with a total value of more than $6 billion in which contract files were incomplete or could not be located at all,” that management alert noted. But does that mean $6 billion went missing? In short, no. In fact, after The Washington Post reported on the management alert in 2014, the State Department IG wrote a letter to the editor seeking to dispel this notion. ”Some have concluded based on this (alert) that $6 billion is missing,” Steve Linick wrote. ”The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion.” ”Instead,” he continued, ”it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files   documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of US tax dollars    ’creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department’s contract actions. ’” Verdict: False. The man in charge of the same office that issued the management alert said the conclusion that $6 billion was lost is false. Rather, the State Department misplaced important documents related to valuable contracts. Russian hacking, Reality Check: Clinton on Trump encouraging Russia to hack US, By Jamie Crawford, CNN, ”It is pretty clear you won’t admit the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people,” Clinton said to Trump about assertions that Russia orchestrated the hack of emails from Clinton’s campaign manager.   While there is no evidence that Trump has personally been involved in directing Russian agents to do the hacking, Clinton is correct that Trump has encouraged Russia of doing similar action.  During comments at a news conference earlier this year, Trump said the following in relation to the controversy over Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state:  ”Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,” Trump said in Florida.  ”They probably have them. I’d like to have them released,” he continued. ”Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I’d love to see them.” Soon after those comments, Trump was asked by Fox News if he was being sarcastic, to which he replied, ”Of course I’m being sarcastic.” Based on Trump’s comments calling on Russia to take the action he did, we rate Clinton’s assertion as true. Clinton also said the following regarding Russia’s alleged role in supplying WikiLeaks with the hacked emails being published from Podesta’s account: ”We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin.”  Earlier this month, US intelligence officials confirmed that emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee were the work of Russian intelligence, with the approval of Russia’s   leaders.  That included the Director of National Intelligence    representing all US intelligence agencies which include civilian and military agencies    and the Department of Homeland Security. ”The kinds of disclosures that we’ve seen, including at WikiLeaks, of stolen emails from people who play an important role in our political process is consistent with   efforts,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said at the time. Based on this, we also rate Clinton’s comments as true. Jobs, Reality Check: Trump calls the most recent jobs report ’anemic’ By Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney, Trump slammed the US job market’s progress in September.  ”They came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report,” Trump said.  The US economy added 156, 000 jobs in September, and though the unemployment ticked up slightly, it is at a relatively low 5%    down from 10% in October 2009. Roughly 90, 000 new jobs per month are needed to keep up with the growth of the job market, according to many economists.  Economists didn’t call it a great jobs report, but didn’t say it was terrible, either. Many used the Goldilocks metaphor that job growth was not too hot nor too cold    it was steady. ”Most of the indicators in the September jobs report were modestly below expectations, but overall they suggest that labor market conditions continue to improve,” Kevin Logan, a US economist at HSBC, said when the report came out. UBS economist Drew Matus called September’s job gains ”healthy.” It was the 72nd consecutive month that the economy gained jobs, marking six straight years of monthly gains in jobs. Since Obama took office in January 2009, the economy has added 10. 8 million jobs overall. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Trump on jobs being ’sucked out’ By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, Trump repeated his familiar refrain that America’s economy and manufacturing base has collapsed. ”Our jobs are being sucked out of the economy,” Trump said. ”You look at all of the places I just left. You go to Pennsylvania. You go to Ohio. You go to Florida. You go to any of them. You go to upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.” And a few minutes later: ”We’ve lost our jobs. We’ve lost our business. We’re not making things anymore, relatively speaking.” We’ve previously examined the claim of jobs leaving the US for Mexico, when Trump made the claim back in September. We found it to be mostly true. But let’s examine the jobs situation Trump outlined. Trump didn’t specify a time period so we will look what’s happened over the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. There are now 144. 7 million workers in America, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s up from 134. 1 million at the start of Obama’s administration in January 2009 and from 132. 7 million when Bush took office in January 2001. And looking at the states that Trump mentioned: Pennsylvania has added 193, 000 positions since Obama took office and by 247, 000 jobs since Bush’s inauguration. In Ohio, employment has risen by 297, 000 during Obama’s tenure, but is down 102, 000 jobs from when Bush took office. Florida’s employment is up by 975, 000 jobs under Obama’s presidency and by 1. 5 million since Bush took office. As for whether we make things in this country, it may not seem like it when Americans shop for clothing, toys or some other consumer products. But the nation’s factories are humming    America still manufactures products from cars to chemicals. The nation’s industrial production has not quite returned to its   high, but is up from 2000 and far up from the 1970s and 1980s, according to Federal Reserve Bank statistics.   We rate Trump’s claim on America losing jobs false. Trump’s accusers, Reality Check: Trump says accusers’ claims against him ’debunked’ By Eve Bower and Kay Guerrero, CNN, Within the last week, nine different women have spoken with various media outlets accusing Trump of   invasive acts ranging from unwelcome advances to physical and sexual assault. At the debate, Trump said, ”those stories have been largely debunked.” Sexual assault accusations are difficult to prove definitively beyond the assertions of the parties involved. Trump has vehemently denied the accusations against him. The nine women maintain that their stories are true. In reporting these allegations, CNN has spoken with six of Trump’s accusers, and has worked to verify details contained in their accounts. CNN has also spoken with friends and colleagues of three accusers, and in each of those cases, the women’s stories were corroborated. Last Friday morning, Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said that ”evidence” would come out that day that would show the assault allegations against him to be false. As of Wednesday’s debate, that evidence has still not emerged. Trump’s claim that the accusations against him have been ”debunked” is false. Reality Check: Trump and women’s accusations, By Theodore Schleifer, CNN, Clinton claimed that Trump had swatted away the women who have accused him of sexual assault by disparaging their looks. ”He had a number of big rallies,” Clinton said, ”where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for   ” ”I did not say that,” Trump interrupted. ”. ..them to be assaulted,” Clinton continued. ”I did not say that,” Trump repeated. Clinton then rattled off a series of comments made by Trump, including him saying, ”Look at her. I don’t think so” ”that wouldn’t be my first choice” and deemed a third woman who wrote a story about the assaults to be ”disgusting.” CNN has not independently verified any of the women’s claims, and Trump has vociferously denied each of their allegations. But Trump has indeed made comments suggesting that he couldn’t have done what was alleged because of how the accusers looked. ”You take a look, look at her, look at her words,” Trump said in West Palm Beach, Florida, of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine writer who alleged misconduct. ”And you tell me what you think. I don’t think so.” ”Believe me, she would not be my first choice,” he said in Greensboro, North Carolina, of Jessica Leeds, who claimed Trump groped her on an airplane. ”That would not be my first choice.” Though not explicitly, Trump certainly left the impression the women’s looks were evidence he did not do what was alleged. We rate that claim by Clinton true. But Clinton went too far, including the description of The New York Times reporter which, based on the reporter’s own account, was his reaction to her writing a negative article, not her looks. We rate this claim false. Taxes, Reality Check: Will Clinton really double your taxes? By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney, Trump asserted that Clinton’s ”tax plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.” Clinton’s plan calls for a range of tax increases on wages and investments, but they target the   households, according to the latest analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The top 1% for instance, would absorb 93% of her proposed tax hikes. Among her proposed tax increases, Clinton wants to implement the   Buffett Rule. It’s named after billionaire Warren Buffett and would require anyone making $2 million or more to pay at least 30% of that in federal income taxes. So to the extent someone making that much pays 15% or less today, their tax bill would double. But on average, the Tax Policy Center estimates that those in the top 0. 1% would see their tax bills rise by 20%.   and   households, meanwhile, would see a small tax cut on average. Broadly speaking, it’s true that Clinton’s tax plan would raise taxes, but they would be raised only on the highest earners. And even among that group, most would not see a doubling of their tax bill. ”I think you could find those edge cases where people would see a doubling of their tax bill. But more generally her plan is relatively modest,” said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, which advocates for lower taxes and a simpler code. Verdict: False. Trump Foundation, Reality Check: Trump on the flag and his foundation, By Kevin Liptak, CNN, Seeking to defend his charitable foundation, Trump sought to explain why he used funds from the group to settle a penalty imposed by a municipal government in Florida. ”The money goes, 100% to a lot of charities, including a lot of military,” Trump said of his namesake foundation. ”I don’t buy boats. I don’t buy planes.” Pressed by Wallace about reports that some of the money had gone to settle lawsuits, Trump said: ”No, we put up the American flag and that’s it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put in the American flag.” ”The money,” Trump said, ”went to Fisher House, where they build houses, the money that you’re talking about went to Fisher House where they build houses for veterans and disabled veterans.” The roundabout explanation stems from a 2007 complaint brought by the city of Palm Beach, Florida, against Trump for raising a flagpole at his    club whose height exceeded regulations. As first reported in The Washington Post, Trump and the city settled the dispute over unpaid fines by agreeing Trump would donate $100, 000 to a veterans’ charity. As the Post reported, the money did come from the Trump Foundation    which is funded primarily with other people’s money. Trump’s campaign didn’t dispute the scenario. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN in September that the ”donations went to veterans groups” and questioned ”how did the    benefit from him giving $100, 000 to veterans?” We rate this true, but misleading. Trump’s claim that his foundation donated the money to the Fisher House veterans charity is accurate, though it only happened after he reached a legal settlement to do so. NATO, Reality Check: Trump claims he got NATO countries to pay their dues, By Jamie Crawford, CNN, Trump said the following about spending of countries in the NATO alliance: ”I questioned NATO. Why aren’t they paying? Since I did this all of a sudden, they’re paying. I’ve been giving a lot of credit for it.  All of a sudden they’re starting to pay up. I’m a big fan of NATO, but they have to pay up.” Trump is correct in saying there is a deficiency by the majority of countries of the 28 nation alliance that do not meet the NATO recommendation that each country spend 2% of its GDP on defense. In fact, only five members    the United States, Estonia, Greece, Poland and the United Kingdom    meet that benchmark, so Trump is correct in asserting that a majority of NATO countries are not paying their fair share.  Throughout his campaign, NATO has been a popular punching bag for the Republican nominee, who has threatened not to honor the commitment to self defense outlined in the NATO treaty unless other countries increase their spending. In testimony before Congress last month, US Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Hoyt Brian Yee told the Senate that ”all 28 allies are moving toward spending at least 2% of GDP on defense, with 70% already on track to meet that goal by 2024.” But is that the result of Trump’s comments this campaign? NATO allies have become alarmed by Russia’s incursion into eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea over the past two years. Over the past year, several NATO countries have rotated forces throughout countries near the Russian border as a show of support. Europe is also under heavy stress from a refugee crisis stemming from the turmoil in the Middle East.  The goal of having more countries meet the NATO spending standards has long been an issue. There is nothing to indicate from the comments from officials of any NATO countries that the increase in spending has been spurred by the rhetoric from Trump or the US campaign trail. Due to the fact that there is nothing to concretely quantify Trump’s claim, we rate his comment as false. Debt, Reality Check: Will Trump add $20 trillion to the debt and Clinton not a penny? By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney, Clinton said that she ”will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I’m going to do. (Trump) will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.” Both candidates’ tax plans have been analyzed by outside tax and budget groups. The latest    from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center    estimates that Trump’s tax cuts would increase the federal debt by $22. 1 trillion over the next 20 years. By contrast, it estimates that Clinton’s tax plan, which raises taxes on the wealthy and some businesses, would reduce the federal debt by at least $5. 4 trillion over the same time period. So Clinton would be correct to say that her tax plan wouldn’t add a penny to the debt and that Trump’s would add $20 trillion. But those numbers don’t include the candidates’ spending proposals. Once Clinton’s tax and spending plans are considered together, her    claim isn’t quite as airtight. Clinton’s proposals as a whole would add an estimated $200 billion to the debt in the first decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Though that $200 billion may end up being paid for once Clinton offers more specifics on what she means by ”business tax reform,” said Marc Goldwein, CRFB’s senior policy director. Still, that’s a lot more than a penny, though $200 billion is a rounding error in the $18 trillion US economy. Verdict: False.

       "        <td>When Tiah Joo Kim arrived at the Manhattan headquarters of the Trump Organization to pitch a hotel and condominium project in Vancouver, British Columbia, he expected the famous company with ventures across the globe to come with capacious offices and a staff of hundreds. Instead, he was led through a mere two floors with what appeared to be no more than a few dozen employees. “Lean,” Mr. Tiah, a young Malaysian developer, remembers thinking as he walked the halls. The first stop was a conference room, where Mr. Tiah was required to sell his vision to the boss’s three oldest children. Only after securing their support did he advance to the inner sanctum, with its sweeping views of Central Park. Mr. Tiah was not sure what to expect from the man whose face was beamed around the world through the reality television show “The Apprentice,” but the conversation that afternoon in 2012 was casual and warm. Donald J. Trump spent more time showing off a Shaquille O’Neal shoe and a Mike Tyson championship belt  —   prize artifacts from his display of sports memorabilia  —   than interrogating Mr. Tiah on the details of his business plan. “You’re a   guy,” Mr. Tiah recalled Mr. Trump telling him as he gave the project his blessing. Then Mr. Trump’s trusted lawyers and other top executives swooped in to play hardball  —   working alongside Donald Trump Jr. to negotiate the confidential agreements that would allow the Vancouver development to be branded with Mr. Trump’s name and managed by his company. The talks consumed   days for nearly a week, Mr. Tiah said, explaining: “It was tiring. They’re tough. ” That is the way business has been done at the Trump Organization, a relatively small company with a big reach and a bigger   that has come under intense scrutiny as its chief prepares to become president of the United States. With extensive entanglements around the world, many packaged in a network of licensing agreements and limited liability companies, the Trump Organization poses a raft of potential conflicts of interest for a   who has long exerted such control over his company that, as he told The New York Times in a recent interview, he is the one who signs the checks. “I like to sign checks so I know what is going on,” he explained. Mr. Trump  —   owner of all but the smallest sliver of the privately held company  —   has said that, while the law does not require it, he is formulating plans to remove himself and his older daughter, Ivanka, from the company’s operations. (Ms. Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, is likely to have a role in the White House.) His sons Donald Jr. and Eric, along with other executives, will be in charge, the   wrote on Twitter in   adding that “no new deals will be done during my term( s) in office. ” People involved in the planning have said that Mr. Trump intends to keep a stake in the business. But in recent weeks, amid rising pressure, Mr. Trump and his advisers have been intensely debating further measures. Among other things, the   has agreed to shut down his personal foundation, has ended some international development deals and has reviewed a plan for an outside monitor to oversee the Trump Organization. Yet an examination of the company underscores the complex challenges of taking Mr. Trump out of Trump the organization. His company is a distinctly family business fortified with longtime loyalists that operates less on standardized procedures and more on a culture of Trump. Mr. Trump may leave the details of contracts to his deputies, but his name  —   and influence  —   is stamped on every deal the company does. In an interview last spring with The Times, Mr. Trump explained that he approved new ventures based on his personal “feel. ” And while in recent years his three oldest children have taken on more of a leadership role, Mr. Trump has the final say, sometimes weighing in on the most minute design details of planned hotels, golf courses or other properties the company owns or manages. His other top executives  —   many of them natives of Queens, where Mr. Trump grew up, or Brooklyn, where his father, Fred, expanded a housing empire many years ago  —   have secured power not necessarily through fancy pedigrees or impressive credentials, but through decades of devotion to their boss. Allen Weisselberg, the organization’s chief financial officer, started off as an accountant for Mr. Trump’s father. Matthew Calamari, the organization’s chief operating officer, was recruited in 1981 after Mr. Trump saw him eject some hecklers while working security at the United States Open tennis tournament. For some executives, there appears to be little division between their service to the company and their service to the Trumps. “We’re not a publicly traded company. At the end of the day, I work for the Trump family,” Alan Garten, the general counsel, explained in an interview with the legal industry publication Corporate Counsel shortly before the election. “That’s how I view my job. Whether it’s protecting their business interests or protecting their personal interests. I am here to assist them and represent them in any way they need. ” When asked to elaborate in an interview last week with The Times, Mr. Garten said that in any job, “you want to be as helpful as you can,” but that “obviously the interests of the Trumps and the interests of the company are two distinct things. ” The divisions between business and politics were often fuzzy during the presidential race: Mr. Garten became a “liaison” to Mr. Trump’s campaign Michael Cohen, an executive vice president, tirelessly promoted his boss’s bid for the White House on television while battling negative media coverage and Jason Greenblatt, the company’s chief legal officer, began serving as his adviser on Israel. On Friday, it was announced that Mr. Greenblatt would be joining Mr. Trump’s administration as a special representative for international negotiations. After the election, other lines continued to blur as the   and his children met with foreign businessmen with connections to their global ventures and with foreign officials with potential influence over their business dealings. Some   lawyers have warned that unless Mr. Trump fully divests himself from the company and places someone independent of his family in charge, he risks entering the White House in violation of a constitutional clause that forbids him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity. As Mr. Trump assumes the presidency, it is difficult to foresee him walling himself off from the company entirely, said Michael D’Antonio, the author of a critical biography, “The Truth About Trump. ” “I don’t think that he could keep himself from inquiring about the performance of these businesses any more than he can keep himself from tweeting,” Mr. D’Antonio said. “It is just too vital to his identity. Profit is the way he has always measured himself. I don’t see how he can stop. ” Mr. Trump may have business interests around the world, but his power is concentrated at a single Midtown Manhattan address: 725 Fifth Avenue. With a gleaming exterior that shoots to the sky, a lobby decked with marble and a collection of   tenants, Trump Tower is his primary residence as well as his company’s headquarters. To get to work, Mr. Trump steps onto the private elevator in his gilded   penthouse, presses 26 and waits a matter of seconds. When the doors open, he is at his office, surrounded by Mr. Garten, Mr. Weisselberg and other top executives. One floor down are the offices of Donald Jr. Eric and Ivanka Trump, who joined the company in the 2000s and are now his top deputies and advance guard. David Brecher, the chief executive of FM Home Loans, visited the Trump Organization about a decade ago to discuss a potential partnership and found the aesthetics telling. “Donald’s floor,” he said, recalling a swirl of gold trim and hues, “is very his style. ” “The kids,” by contrast, “have a very cool floor. Sleek. Marble. ” Photographs of Mr. Trump with the rich and powerful adorn his office walls, and his desk often overflows with papers, evidence of his refusal to communicate by email. When Mr. Trump wants to talk to someone, he calls out to his assistant, Rhona Graff, a Queens native whose office is right outside his door. She has been his gatekeeper for decades. Anyone seeking access to him over the phone has to go through Ms. Graff, sometimes with a secret code. Mr. Trump often boasts of the size of the Trump Organization. “It’s a big company,” he said in the interview last spring. A spokeswoman said the business employed “tens of thousands. ” But industry experts estimate that no more than 4, 000 people work for the Trump Organization worldwide. And executives say that the three floors that make up the headquarters appear to have no more than 150 employees. It is a family business, as everyone involved is quick to explain. And the management structure is informal if not confusing, with deputies constantly buzzing in and out of the boss’s office. “We kind of run a little bit like a    in that sense,” Donald Trump Jr. said in a 2011 deposition for a lawsuit involving a Florida development. “I guess there is an organizational chart, but in theory, there is not too many levels. ” He added: “Could I make one? Yes. Is there one officially? Not that I’m aware of. ” Indeed, the elder Mr. Trump has tended to collect executives and assign duties through personal preference. In 2004, Michelle Carlson was a young lawyer determined to move to California when a friend suggested that she meet with an acquaintance who could prove useful. She entered Mr. Trump’s office hoping to secure a recommendation she could use to find work with real estate developers in Los Angeles, and she encountered a warm welcome. “I heard there was this nice Atlanta girl in the lobby,” she remembered Mr. Trump saying as he offered her a seat. Then came a series of direct questions: What were her responsibilities at her current job? How did she view her own strengths? In what areas did she want to grow?   minutes later, Mr. Trump was convinced: “I’m not going to give you any recommendations in L. A. I’m going to hire you,” Mr. Trump told Ms. Carlson, who went on to spend almost four years as his assistant general counsel, often working   days with a small team of lawyers while taking on other responsibilities in the real estate division. Andrew Weiss, a Romanian immigrant who grew up in Brooklyn, was hired straight out of graduate school in 1981, just as Mr. Trump was starting to make his mark.   years later, having weathered many highs and lows with Mr. Trump, including the spectacular failure of his Atlantic City casinos, Mr. Weiss is still by his side, as executive vice president for development and construction. Mr. Calamari, who started out as a bodyguard, also saw his role expand as he remained committed to his boss. Five years ago, his son Matthew Calamari Jr. joined the Trump Organization as a security guard. Today, he is the director of surveillance. Brian Baudreau, the general manager of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, began as a driver for Mr. Trump. “My father knows how to find talent in people,” Eric Trump said, recalling how Mr. Baudreau used to chauffeur him to school. “He’s totally family,” he added. Devotion is rewarded. “To succeed in this company,” Mr. Garten said, “you have to be skilled, highly dedicated and highly loyal. ” Some appear to be hired based on other calculations. For more than a decade, Ronald C. Lieberman oversaw the concession contracts for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, a post that required him to represent the interests of the city in a variety of deals with Mr. Trump. Then, in 2007, Mr. Lieberman began working for a new employer. In his job as executive vice president for management and development at the Trump Organization, he has helped Mr. Trump win contracts to operate the Central Park carousel and the Ferry Point golf course in the Bronx, the very projects he handled on behalf of the city for years. Ivanka Trump is generally seen as the   powerful person at the Trump Organization, while the 11 other executive vice presidents are all men  —   and all white. There have been other senior female executives, like Cathy Hoffman Glosser, who oversaw the Trump Organization’s expansion into branding deals, part of its shift from building and buying real estate to selling the Trump name. (She left the company last year and did not respond to interview requests. Ms. Carlson said she left by choice to care for her baby, even though Mr. Trump made earnest attempts to keep her.) Mr. Garten said that outside the top executive ranks, “there’s greater diversity in terms of gender and ethnicity,” adding, “I don’t have the numbers in front of me. ” Jill Martin, a vice president and assistant general counsel for litigation and employment, said in an interview last spring that diversity at the company was “less forced” than at the law firms where she previously worked. “With the firms, there was a lot of attention placed on gender and ethnicity and trying to find the balance,” she said. “With the Trump Organization, I just felt like those things really fall by the wayside. What’s important is someone’s individual drive and talent. ” When Mr. Tiah was at Trump Tower to discuss the Vancouver partnership, he could not help noticing that female employees seemed to have something else in common. “You have to be attractive?” he remembers thinking. “Is that a requirement?” It was the   and Phil Ruffin was in search of a partner to develop a combined hotel and condominium tower on the Las Vegas Strip. Mr. Ruffin, a casino tycoon, owned the land, but he needed an investor, a brand name to license and a team to manage the construction and operations of the property. Mr. Trump did not simply say yes to all three, Mr. Ruffin recalled. He threw himself into the details of the deal, pushing a bank to cut the interest rate on a loan by half, insisting that subcontractors lower their prices and requiring that everything about the   tower reflect his taste. “We’d tour, and he’d say, ‘This is wrong this is right,’” Mr. Ruffin said. “The glass shower had to be etched glass because that’s the Trump way, more expensive. He didn’t want just a TV in the bathroom it had to be in the mirror so you can watch when you’re shaving. ” Mr. Trump, he said, remained actively involved when the financial crisis hit in 2008, threatening the financial viability of the Las Vegas venture, and the two men flew to Washington to meet with a tax lawyer. As they pulled up chairs in his office, the lawyer encouraged the men to cut their losses and declare bankruptcy. It would provide them with a handsome tax deduction. But Mr. Trump was adamant. “He said: ‘This is not Atlantic City this is Las Vegas. I think it will recover,’” Mr. Ruffin said. Instead, he and Mr. Trump poured more money into the venture and continued to move forward. Mr. Trump’s children have taken on increasing responsibility in recent years they often solicit new projects and are the primary liaisons with partners. Two years ago, Eric Trump became the Trump Organization’s main point of contact for the Las Vegas tower, Mr. Ruffin said. Ivanka Trump initiated the leasing of the old Old Post Office building in Washington, envisioning it as a new Trump hotel. But Mr. Trump has the final say on most deals, especially those involving his own money. He has signed the licensing agreements, the leases  —   and the big checks. And the tangle of limited liability companies used to structure all of his deals revolve around a single point of power: Mr. Trump. As one former executive described it, the company is the “hub of a wheel, and he’s in the middle. ” The company adheres to few formal corporate guidelines or procedures. When determining whether and how to enter business partnerships, nothing is decided by established committee, or through written recommendation by the children, Donald Trump Jr. explained in the 2011 deposition in the Florida case. “Other companies can operate like bureaucrats” Mr. Tiah said. “They’re not like that. ” Even so, the executives are known for playing tough. When seeking $470, 000 in outstanding legal bills from the Trump Organization a decade ago, the lawyer Y. David Scharf accidentally included a single page of a separate legal bill to another client, the business magnate Carl C. Icahn. How did Mr. Weisselberg, Mr. Trump’s chief financial officer, respond? “Mr. Weisselberg threatened to call Mr. Icahn and utilize this inadvertent clerical error in an effort to embarrass Mr. Scharf and my firm  —   unless my firm agreed to a 50 percent discount on the outstanding legal bills,” David A. Piedra, a partner in Mr. Scharf’s firm, Morrison Cohen, wrote in a 2007 letter to a lawyer representing Mr. Trump. “As I am sure you realize,” he wrote, “this threat, which smacks of extortion, is entirely inappropriate. ” Mr. Scharf said in an interview that his firm had resolved the matter and bore no ill will toward Mr. Weisselberg, the Trump Organization or Mr. Trump. At the time of the election, Mr. Trump’s company was party to at least 75 lawsuits across the country, according to a nationwide tally by USA Today. Mr. Garten said that not all of the lawsuits were substantial, but acknowledged that “we’re extremely   and meticulous in the legal aspects of the business. ” As their boss advanced in the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Trump’s executives remained fierce and aggressive. When The Daily Beast was preparing to publish an article about Mr. Trump’s first wife, Ivana, alleging in a divorce deposition that he had raped her, Michael Cohen, one of the organization’s executive vice presidents, wrongly insisted it was impossible for a husband to rape his wife and made threats. He warned that if the reporter moved ahead with the article, “I’m going to mess your life up,” according to The Daily Beast’s account. It was just one of the many ways that Mr. Cohen had cultivated the image of a pit bull, a reputation he said was well deserved. “Mr. Trump is more than just a boss to those of us who have been fortunate enough to be close to him, both professionally and personally,” he said in an interview. “He’s more like a patriarch, a mentor. These qualities make him very endearing to me, which is why I am so fiercely loyal to him and committed to protecting him at all costs. ” He was not the only seemingly tireless proponent  —   and protector  —   of Mr. Trump’s political pursuits. Mr. Garten, the general counsel, defended his boss’s record and fought back against allegations that he had groped women and engaged in other sexual misconduct. At points it appeared as if he were threatening legal action on a daily basis against anyone who criticized Mr. Trump, including The Times and other news outlets. Last December, after Mr. Garten dangled the possibility of legal action against a “super PAC” promoting Jeb Bush and sent a    letter to an   group that ran $1 million in ads against Mr. Trump, supporters of Mr. Bush complained to the Federal Election Commission that the Trump Organization was illegally acting as an agent for the Trump campaign. “Trump and his agents have explicitly directed his corporate attorneys at the Organization to do the dirty work for the campaign,” a lawyer wrote in the complaint, which is pending. Six months later, Mr. Garten began to appear in the campaign’s financial reports. In the end, he was compensated by Mr. Trump for about $24, 000 of legal work for the campaign and donated thousands more dollars’ worth of services as an   contribution. Mr. Garten said he saw many of the attacks on Mr. Trump as an attack on the company. It was his job to fight back, he said. The  ’s deliberations over how to separate himself from his company coincided with one of its oldest and most celebrated traditions. Jill Cremer, a former vice president at the Trump Organization, fondly recalls company Christmas parties at the Plaza Hotel, the Pierre or the Rainbow Room. Mr. Trump would hand out prizes  —   airline tickets, luggage, cameras  —   and would pose with employees for photos. “The Christmas party was always the highlight,” Ms. Cremer said. “It was a real family affair. ” This year, the celebration fell on Dec. 14, two nights after Mr. Trump said he would postpone announcing the details of his plan for the stewardship of the company. He was facing a flurry of activity, including making cabinet picks and navigating calls with foreign leaders, but he found the time to stop by the atrium of Trump Tower, where the party has been held in recent years. As hundreds of Trump Organization employees and guests nibbled on steak from Trump Grill and sipped wine from Trump Winery, Mr. Trump thanked the crowd for helping build the company that bears his name. “You could see the love in the room,” Eric Trump said.</td>\n",

       "        <td> (CNN) President Donald Trump is coming to the end of his first 100 days in office, and everyone has an opinion about his performance. We asked CNN contributors and analysts to weigh on the good, the bad and the what comes next of Trump’s first 100 days. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. Jennifer Granholm: With a ’honeymoon’ like this, divorce can’t come soon enough  Donald Trump promised to complete 103 agenda items during his first 100 days in office. Of those, he has completed six  —   all aided by his   powers. That’s an F grade by any measure.  The first 100 days are supposed to be a honeymoon for the new president to start accomplishing his or her priorities. A honeymoon as bad as Trump’s is a big red flag that the marriage isn’t going to be any good, either. Despite his   deal making ”abilities,” Trump has failed to convince his own   Congress to pass a single piece of legislation that he promised in his ”Contract with the American Voter” for the first 100 days   not one. His major executive orders are being blocked by courts. The Republican replacement plan for Obamacare would rip away health care from 26 million Americans and cause premiums for those with preexisting conditions to explode. Trump is   us into another war. His budget slashes funding for everything from arts and research funding to after school programs to Meals on Wheels to food for poor women, infants, and children. His tax plan is a massive gift to millionaires and billionaires, paid for with trillions in debt to China.   In contrast, President Obama fulfilled substantial achievements in his ambitious first 100 days. With the backing of Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, Democrats laid the groundwork for the economic recovery that led to more than 15 million new jobs, saved the auto industry, took steps to protect equal pay for equal work in the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, provided 4 million children with health insurance, and passed a federal budget reflecting our ideals    all major pieces of legislation that had significant, positive impact on the lives of Americans. Presidents Obama and Trump both realize that the first 100 days of a new president’s administration are critical because the first three months, in theory and in practice, are when she or he is at their most popular and able to use that political clout to accomplish things. Ronald Reagan’s first 100 days gave him a 68 percent approval rating, George W. Bush’s approval was 62 percent, and Barack Obama’s approval was at 65 percent.  Donald Trump is at a meager 40 percent approval    the most unpopular   president in history.  In other words, Trump’s honeymoon is the worst we’ve seen in modern times. As we take stock of President Trump’s honeymoon, his first 100 days are a window into the damage he could do in the next 100 days, and the next 100 after that.  The marriage looks rocky. Divorce, in this case, can’t come soon enough.   Grade: F, Jennifer Granholm is the former governor and former attorney general of Michigan and a CNN contributor. Rick Santorum: I hope the president has learned that knowledge is king  Let me begin by throwing cold water on the next 200 words: The first hundred days paradigm is a concoction of the Washington chattering class.  That said, I’ll play the parlor game and give you my report card of President Trump’s first hundred days. The greatest victory of President Trump’s first hundred days is without a doubt the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the U. S. Supreme Court. The promise of a strict constructionist justice to replace Antonin Scalia is why many hesitant conservatives voted for a candidate they did not fully embrace.  On this count, Donald Trump reassured the skeptical and helped shaped not the next 100 days, but the next generation of American jurisprudence.  As for losses, everyone points to health reform. Indeed, Trump did lose the first battle principally because he delegated the bill drafting to the Congress, then tried to pass Speaker Ryan’s failed bill. The President was a quick study and learned the policy as the bill was being renegotiated, but it was too late. I hope the president has learned knowledge is king in Washington. The President needs to understand the complexities of this and other issues so he can shape the battlefield and lead the charge instead of trying to rally soldiers in full retreat.  Grade: solid B, Rick Santorum is a former Republican Senator from Pennsylvania and a contributor to CNN.  Errol Louis: Trump missed the honeymoon because there was never a marriage, President Trump’s low public approval numbers suggest that the   honeymoon is already over. Only 44% of adult Americans approve of his performance so far, with 54% disapproving    by far the worst numbers of any president at this point in his term since modern polling began.  Trump missed the honeymoon because there was never a marriage. Instead of reaching out to Democratic leaders in Congress or trying to woo supporters of Hillary Clinton, Trump spent much of his first three months antagonizing Democrats on social media, scrambling to organize his staff and squelch nagging questions about Russian interference in the 2016 elections. That didn’t leave much time or energy to focus on his main agenda items. It’s telling that the Trump’s top aides who appear to be getting the most done are the men with substantial Washington experience, especially Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who spent a dozen years in the Justice Department and a decade as a senator on Capitol Hill. While Beltway newcomers like Treasury chief Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of State Tillerson have stumbled out of the gate, Sessions has made aggressive moves to curb funding for sanctuary cities and review   consent decrees and other reforms.  Trump’s single best move for the future will be to tone down the   antagonism by staging meaningful   visits and policy speeches aimed at core Democratic constituencies, including women, blacks, Latinos, and young people. It’s never too late to hope for a honeymoon.  Grade:   Errol Louis is a CNN political commentator and the host of ”Inside City Hall,” a nightly political show on NY1, a New York   channel. SE Cupp: Until his supporters care, what we say about Trump matters very little, It’s clear by most any metric, President Trump’s first 100 days in office have amounted to a fairly anemic success record. But as a limited government conservative, I’m hardly disappointed. That the era of big government programs, sweeping reform and overreach has seemingly come to an abrupt halt    whether by design or default    is nothing to mourn.   For those of us who never thought Trump could make good on many of his promises    to rip up various ”bad deals” on day 1, to replace Obamacare quickly, to build a wall that Mexico pays for, to stamp out ISIS easily    our measure of his first few months is irrelevant. Nor does it really matter what his critics on the left and in the media think of how he’s doing. All that matters is whether or not his supporters approve. And by that measurement, he’s doing just fine. According to a new ABC   Post poll, Trump’s approval is at record lows. But among his supporters?   percent say they would vote for him again. That is a staggering figure, considering how few promises he’s managed to keep. Further, the poll indicates that if the election were held today, he could beat Hillary Clinton again and win the popular vote. The pundit class can hem and haw all it wants about how   it is that Trump’s accomplished so little in his first 100 days. And it’s inarguable that he has. But until his supporters care, our assessments matter little. Grade: B, S. E. Cupp is an HLN host of a   program covering contemporary issues and a CNN political commentator. Van Jones: This sin will prove hardest to forgive   100 years from now, Americans will have harsh words about Trump’s first 100 days. But no day will more represent the lasting damage than day 89. That is really saying something. After all, this president is embroiled in scandal, from Russia’s undue influence to business conflicts of interest. He has tried and failed three times to ban Muslims from America. Turnout at protests dwarfed his meager inaugural crowd. His   attorney general perjured himself and has pushed outdated criminal justice policies opposed by many in both parties. Nominees have withdrawn, his close ally Michael Flynn resigned in disgrace, and health care went down in flames in the face of town hall outrage. In fact, Sen. Mitch McConnell can claim more credit for the sole bright spot for Republicans    now Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch    than can Trump. But on Tuesday, April 18    day 89    scientists recorded the first carbon dioxide reading above 410 parts per million. On that day, one thing became clear: the potentially catastrophic impact of Trump’s decision to single out the Environmental Protection Agency for the greatest budget cuts of any agency. Now is the worst time for a US president to deny the reality of climate science. Of all his sins, this one will prove the hardest to forgive. Grade: F minus (the minus is because he let down his own followers, too) Van Jones is a CNN political commentator. Kayleigh McEnany: A truly   president  Buried beneath the salacious headlines is the portrait of a president who has defied his party, not only in word but in action.  Tax credits for health care, preservation of preexisting conditions provisions and withdrawing from free trade deals combine to tell the story of a president who puts people before party. Despite initial blips with the temporary travel halt and health care, President Trump is well on his way to changing his party and country. Trump is truly a   president. Grade:   Kayleigh McEnany is a CNN commentator and a contributor to The Hill.  Aaron David Miller: What Trump has learned    and not learned    so far  There’s a lot you can do in 100 days: begin taking guitar lessons, lose weight or start an exercise program. But the   metric really can’t tell you much about what kind of foreign policy president Donald Trump might become. It is a useful indicator of  whether he’s learning anything on the job. Here are my takeaways of the learned and unlearned    so far: Campaigning was fun. But I can’t run foreign policy that way. I’ve changed my views on almost every issue    from scuttling the Iran nuclear accord to declaring NATO obsolete to questioning the value of the One China policy    and tacked back to more traditional positions in line with Obama and the Republican party establishment, too. The question now is can my administration develop not positions but policies to navigate a complex world. Foreign policy isn’t the real estate business I need help. This foreign policy stuff is harder than I thought. I really needed adult supervision and, I’m getting it from Mattis McMaster Tillerson. I actually listen to them    most of the time. America first doesn’t mean America only. I can’t just beat up or bully other nations. I may actually need their help, like China on North Korea who knows maybe even NATO. And I ’m still looking to do a deal with that guy Putin. I’m still Donald Trump. And I intend to continue tweeting and saying  all kinds of inappropriate things that will confuse and worry our allies and hurt US credibility. Just today I retweeted Nigel Farage’s criticism of Emmanuel Macron. I sure hope that Le Pen lady wins.  Grade: ”Incomplete minus” Aaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He was also a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Jen Psaki: Trump’s biggest failure is not reaching out  Washington, D. C. is the only place in the country that marks the lead up to the first 100 days of a presidency with such fanfare.  But this short period of time does give a hint as to how any president will approach his time in office.  How he will govern and lead the country.  Despite the fact that Trump has not passed a single piece of significant legislation, has proposed a   bill that would leave tens of millions without access, his supporters are loyal and they appear to be sticking with him.  But governing is not about just speaking to your hardcore supporters, it is about reaching out to the entire country.  And of all of the ups and downs of the first 100 downs, that is his biggest failure. Jen Psaki, a CNN political commentator and spring fellow at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, served as the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. Alice Stewart: It’s a work in progress  If you lay down a marker in Gettysburg, you need to mean it.  In 1863, Abraham Lincoln made meaningful history addressing freedom, equality and unity in Gettysburg in 2016, President Trump outlined his   action plan to ”Make America Great Again”    it’s safe to say that’s a work in progress. To date, President Trump has followed through on policy initiatives by signing executive orders, but has yet to achieve meaningful legislative success. President Trump’s five biggest accomplishments include:  1. Following through on his commitment to confirm a   justice with Justice Neil Gorsuch, 2. Withdrawing from the   Partnership, 3. Moving forward with construction of the Keystone Pipeline, 4. Reducing federal regulations, 5. Curtailing funding to Planned Parenthood. Five most significant unfulfilled promises:  1. Repealing and replacing Obamacare, 2. Providing ”the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan” (he’s provided some ideas in this direction, but it’s unclear how he intends to organize and get a plan passed by Congress) 3. Labeling China a currency manipulator, 4. Building a wall that Mexico will pay for, 5. Suspending visas from ”terror prone regions.”  While President Trump’s road to the White House was paved with good intentions it’s time to make inroads on legislative accomplishments. I expect the second 100 days to include progress in health care and tax reform.  It’s clear President Trump has learned that governing is more difficult than campaigning.  Grade: C+ Alice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President. Michael D’Antonio: Willing to be presidential, but sometimes beneath his office, We saw the best of the Donald Trump presidency when he met with China’s President Xi Jinping and then announced that suddenly China was not a currency manipulator. This announcement, amid worsening tensions with North Korea, showed Trump was willing to be presidential and pursue the interest of the nation and the world by abandoning a campaign slogan. Likewise, Trump’s recognition that NATO is not obsolete demonstrated he could play well with others. His worst moment came with his unsubstantiated tweet alleging that President Obama tapped the phones at Trump Tower. This was a destructive and   use of his old    tactic, intended to confuse and distract the press and public. It was beneath his office. Grade: A gentleman’s   below average but above failing  Michael D’Antonio is the author of the book ”Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success” (St. Martin’s Press).  Yascha Mounk: The gap between Trump’s words and actions matters most  If you look at Donald Trump’s words over the last 100 days, all of the worst fears have come true. After an unorthodox inaugural address, Trump continued to break every basic democratic norm: He has spread ”alternative facts,” railed against ” ” judges, and called major news outlets ”enemies of the American people.” The presidency has not made Donald Trump more presidential. If you look at Donald Trump’s actions over the last 100 days, by contrast, the record is much more mixed. I strongly disagree with Trump on many of his policies, from immigration to health care. But he has also seemed to moderate on key issues, including NATO and his relationship with key allies. More importantly, he has so far respected the independence of institutions even as he has loudly criticized them. Instead of vowing to disobey the Ninth Circuit’s rulings against his executive orders, for example, he merely tweeted: ”See you in the Supreme Court!” Looking forward, a lot will depend on whether or not Trump starts to act on his rhetoric. If his extreme statements will continue to be but so much hot air, important democratic norms will continue to take a beating, but the worst damage will be avoided. But if Trump starts to walk his scary talk, the next four years could get a lot worse than the first 100 days have been. Yascha Mounk is the author of the new book, ”The Age of Responsibility: Luck, Choice, and the Welfare State.”  Steve Israel: On Day 101, Trump needs to reach across the aisle, The best decisions Trump made in his first 100 days were nominating Gen. Mattis as defense secretary and replacing Michael Flynn with Gen. McMaster as National Security Adviser.  In a volatile and complex security environment, having strategic and experienced leaders like McMaster and Mattis within the administration is reassuring. They are, unfortunately, the exception to the rule.  President Trump has reneged on one of his most basic and important campaign promises, which was to ”drain the swamp.” Between the investigations into Russia’s involvement in the election surrounding himself with people like Steve Bannon, Jeff Sessions, Scott Pruitt and Betsy DeVos refusing to release his taxes and restricting access to the White House visitors’ logs, the swamp has become a sewer.  As Day 101 approaches, President Trump must begin to reach across the aisle, not only to Democrats in Congress, who he will need in order to pass legislation to keep the government functioning    but to regular Americans who did not vote for him. There is still a large portion of the American public that feel alienated by him and the rhetoric and policies he has advanced. If he wants to be a successful leader, he doesn’t need everyone’s support, but he needs more people in his corner than the members of the Freedom Caucus.  Finally, remember this: No Member of Congress cares about a president’s first 100 days. They’re focused on the last 100 days before their midterm elections. And right now, for many Republicans, those days are getting dark. Grade: D, Former US Rep. Steve Israel, a Democrat from New York, is chairman of the Global Institute at Long Island University and a CNN contributor.  Jeffrey Lord: Napoleon would be jealous  Somewhere Napoleon is wistful. Exiled to Elba, he escaped his island prison in 1815, marching on Paris. The Congress of Vienna declared him an outlaw, armies massed, and Napoleon soon met his Waterloo. This period of turbulent French history immediately acquired a  name: ”les Cent Jours”   the Hundred Days. Over a century later, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in the middle of the Great Depression, the press of the day resurrected the term to describe the whirlwind of activity that was the opening act of FDR’s New Deal. Fairly or unfairly, the term has been applied to every president since. Now, it’s President Trump’s turn. While the President calls the measurement ”ridiculous,” the White House has still put out volumes listing accomplishments. A Supreme Court appointment has been his best achievement. The new Justice Gorsuch will presumably be there for decades as a conservative. There are 24 executive orders on the Trump list, with seriously important ones such as   the Keystone Pipeline. Military action in Syria is certainly on the list. Health care will come, but not by the   deadline. But there will still be 1, 341 days to go in Trump’s term. Napoleon could only wish for that much time. Grade: Thanks to the health care delay, an   Jeffrey Lord is a CNN political commentator.

Trump has so far shown he doesn’t have the patience to translate any of his bluster into action and, meanwhile, keeps hurting America’s standing in the world with his petty short tempered arrogance. Still sad.  Grade: F, Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and CNN political commentator. Salena Zito: Accomplishments are in the eyes of the beholder, Donald J. Trump’s presidency is under the microscope by the press for his accomplishments in his first 100 days in office for my profession, his measurement is taken by the campaign promises that he pledged during the 2016 campaign. But for voters who supported him, that measurement was always going to be different. As Brad Todd once noted and I reported, voters took his rhetoric seriously, but not literally. The press took every word literally and his candidacy not very seriously. If you are judging his presidency by his literal use of words    something he does casually and without the same meaning as journalists or traditional politicians    he has fallen behind on his pledge on a number of things reforming Obamacare, the travel restrictions from countries with known terrorist activities and building a wall between the US and Mexico. But if you voted for him you view his actions differently. Voters have told me in hundreds of interviews across the country that they understand that negotiations take time on Capitol Hill (health care, the wall, the budget) that activist judges have always been a thorn in every president’s side (travel restriction executive order and sanctuary cities). Their view of his accomplishments is optimistic they are thrilled that he is constantly meeting with company executives, union and trade groups and car manufacturers. They like his executive orders on regulations, Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court and his willingness to hold open discussion with the leaders of China and Egypt. Accomplishments are in the eyes of the beholder and voters are willing to give the president time to accomplish his goals as long as he is viewed as rolling up his sleeves and fighting for them and their community’s needs. Washington will always measure him differently    essentially because he is so disruptive to the status quo, does not view the political class with the same chumminess that other presidents have and he does not value words with the same reverence that they do.

[It’s amazing the the mainstream media would attack Trump’s comments about Saddam and how he questioned whether the Middle East would be more stable had Hussein remained in power. Isn’t that the reason why George H. W. Bush decided not to take Hussein out?

She says as long as the email scandal is out there, she can’t go much longer trying to ignore what everyone sees —  the discrepancies and the contradictions. 12:54: Trump, echoing what he said during the GOP debates, responds to Clinton: I have built a tremendously successful business, which has created tens of thousands of jobs. Out of the hundreds of businesses I have owned over the decades, and hundreds of deals and transactions, I have used the chapter laws of our country in four instances, much as many of our country’s elite business people do (but nobody cares about). It is an effective and commonly used practice in business to use bankruptcy proceedings to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs. Nobody understands the economy like I do and no one, especially not Crooked Hillary Clinton, will do more for the economy than I will. I want to bring jobs back to America, while Hillary Clinton wants to get elected to enrich herself with power at the expense of the people. I created thousands of jobs and made a lot of money in Atlantic City, which was what, as a businessman, I am supposed to do for my company and my family —   and as President I will make America rich again, and Make America Great Again. 12:46: Clinton says Trump is “temperamentally unfit” to be President and we can’t let him “roll the dice with our children’s future. ” She says we need to write a new chapter in the American Dream and it can’t be “Chapter 11. ” Clinton is not a good candidate on the stump. She had a perfect chance to knock it out of the park here. But had this been a WWE promo, Clinton would definitely not have “gotten over. ” [Media seem more eager to thoroughly research Trump’s bankruptcy than all of Clinton’s   re: her email scandal.

She rips Trump for taking advantage of working Americans, especially in Atlantic City. She cites Trump’s numerous lawsuits. She says he’s had a lawsuit every three days on average.

       "        <td> (CNN) President Donald Trump was sworn in Friday. CNN contributors and analysts offered these assessments of the 45th president’s inauguration. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. Lanhee Chen: Trump’s message    I won’t change, Donald Trump’s inaugural address was classic Trump. It showed remarkable consistency with the themes and language that he used on the campaign trail last year    up to his closing assertion that we will ”make America great again.”  And it reiterated the basic policy promises that he made during his campaign: a tough stance on immigration an ”America first” foreign policy and a deep skepticism toward free trade.  Trump reminded us that he isn’t a   Republican. And showed that he will be willing to break from his party’s orthodoxy when it clashes with his populist sensibilities. The speech was indeed targeted at those who supported him during the campaign, but it also sent a strong and important message to those who did not    the message that we should not expect Trump to change just because he’s been sworn in as our new president.

Roxanne Jones:  America’s other face  No day in our nation feels more patriotic than Inauguration Day    the Marine Marching Band, the past presidents, politicians and power brokers braving the cold to flock to our nation’s capital. But it was hard not to look at the sea of white faces in the crowd, gathered for President Donald J. Trump’s   and not see represented a shockingly different America than we saw on this same day eight years ago when President Barack Obama was sworn in. In fact, this was the whitest inauguration I’ve witnessed in my lifetime. Still, I believe Trump when he said we are all one nation with one home, one heart and one shared destiny. Harder to believe his vow to end ”right now”crime, drugs, failing schools and political corruption. Trump promised to bring back jobs, build new airports, tunnels and roads. Lofty words for a pep rally, but any realistic person knows no president can wave a magic wand and fix all of these problems immediately    especially if we spend all of our time focusing on the politics of protectionism and fearing our neighbors around the world because they don’t look or pray like us. Politics aside, I want President Trump to make me proud. We all deserve this. But on this rainy winter day, somehow it seemed ominous that instead of looking toward America’s bright future with optimism, nearly every speaker focused on how we were witnessing ”a peaceful transition of power,” as if this is the best thing we can offer the world on this day. We’ll have to do much better than that if we seek to Make America Great Again.

Ruth  : Trump’s authoritarianism was showing today, If anyone had doubts about President Trump’s authoritarian nature and intentions, the inaugural speech should set them at rest. Over and over, Trump communicated that this transition is not like others we’ve known: January 20, 2017 marks the start of a New Era, one unburdened by memories of the past. In fact, less than half hour after he was sworn in, the US Government webpages on climate change and LGBT Workplace Rights Advancement Report disappeared. It’s a clue as to what to expect from Trump’s administration: an assault on the causes and movements that don’t conform to Trump’s   vision of what’s good for our country. Trump positioned himself as a populist above all party politics    a red flag of authoritarianism, and another sign that the GOP was simply his vehicle to get into power. This speech warned all Americans that starting ”right here and right now” things will be different. It’s the kind of talk that seeks to intimidate, and it conforms fully to the culture of threat Trump’s been putting into place through his   on ordinary citizens and large corporations alike. Our job? To resist going silent in the face of aggression. To practice in our daily lives the compassion and rectitude that seems absent from our new President’s character. We are better than this. The burden’s on us to show it.  Ruth   is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion and a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University.

Mark Bauerlein:  A restoration of popular will, Well, the unthinkable is complete    that is, the unthinkable as seen by my professor colleagues across the country and by millennials on campus and off.  President Trump’s inauguration speech likely only confirmed their incredulity.   He didn’t soften one bit    no toning down, no conciliation. A ”small group” of DC politicians have sold out the American people, he thundered.  They have pursued their own interests and ignored the citizens they were supposed to represent, but ”you will never be ignored again,” he promised. They have enriched the world and impoverished their own constituents, but ”a nation exists to serve its citizens,” not the citizens of other countries. The contentious manner doesn’t bother me.  It is necessary to the great civic meaning of America.  As Walt Whitman put it 160 years ago, ”The genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures . . . but always most in the common people.”  He praised ”the terrible significance of their elections    the President’s taking off his hat to them, not they to him.” President Trump is squarely in this tradition. In the last half century, the sovereignty of the people has steadily been eroded by unelected judges and government bureaucrats. They feel that the government increasingly tells them what to do and what to think.   Trump is a restoration of popular will, and the evidence of today’s words shows that he isn’t going to curb his   populism one bit.

Its core is the promise to transfer power from Washington D. C. to the people.  There is something genuinely appealing about that.  But throughout the speech, as throughout his campaign, it also becomes clear that Trump’s definition of the people is as important for whom it excludes as for whom it includes. Claiming to be the true voice of the people, he implicitly casts everybody who disagrees with him as an enemy of the people.  It is this negative energy that most worries me for the years to come. Because once any problem that the country has before you took power is explained by the corruption of your political enemy, and any attempt to resist your rule as an illegitimate betrayal of the will of the people, the path to autocracy is laid. There are many tasks which those who are horrified by Trump’s ascent will face in the coming months. But perhaps the most urgent is to insist that we, too, are part of the American    that Donald Trump does not have an exclusive claim to speak on our behalf.

Frida Ghitis: Trump starts under a cloud, It kept threatening to rain as Donald Trump became President of the United States. But it wasn’t about the rain it was the gathering clouds that loomed menacingly over the new administration and the country. The inauguration ceremony served as a reminder that Americans should respect their democracy, the peaceful transfer of power, and the office of the president. But Trump’s campaign, the transition, and his inaugural address help explain why this event was unlike any in the past, darkened by unease, defiance, and concerns about what’s ahead. Trump took the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts, someone Trump described as an ”an absolute disaster” during a campaign in which he insulted hundreds of people. After the oath, he gave a speech that most experts had predicted would do what inaugural addresses do, namely call for national unity, for healing the wounds of a   election. But no, Trump’s speech was a populist, nationalistic campaign screed, with   attacks on the outgoing administration, and a triumphalist tone that would have sounded routine eight decades ago in Europe.  An administration that starts under the cloud of investigations over interference by a foreign power, with disdain for conflicts of interest, and with a track record of lying to the American public, also begins with much of the nation determined to keep it in check. That’s the silver lining around those clouds. Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. David Andelman:  A warning for the rest of the world, The world was watching, but got little comfort from Donald Trump’s inaugural address. The theme was quite clearly stated: ”We are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, in every hall of power,” President Trump proclaimed, ”From this day forward it’s going to be only America first.” The message was calculated to spread fear among so many of the traditional friends of the United States, who have sheltered for decades under its protective umbrella.  Those days may be very much in the rear view mirror. ”We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own,” was a potentially dire  warning. One unspoken issue, however, is that as he arrives in office as the least popular president in modern history, how much real traction will he have in many corners of the world to make good on what could only be seen as a threat rather than an open hand of friendship? Still, the new president concluded with a note of hope: ”We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones.” Provided, of course, one is not antithetical to the other. So much to explore in the new era to come. David A.

Alice Stewart:  An inspirational message of unity, It was Donald J. Trump being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, but from where I stood amidst the crowd, people heard and felt his message that ”today is the day the people became the rulers of this country.” President Trump’s inaugural speech was inspirational.  Many took comfort in his commitment that ”the forgotten people will be forgotten no longer.” The first step in ”The Art of the Deal” is to ”think big” President Trump took that one step further as he inspired the crowd with the words ”Think big, dream even bigger.”   As he inherits a country that is deeply divided, President Trump called for unity reminding citizens that no matter the color of their skin, ”we all bleed the same red blood of patriotism.” Thomas Jefferson made a similar plea for unity in his inaugural address in 1800, stating, ”every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.” That same sentiment holds true today. President Trump reminded us ”when America is united, it is unstoppable.”  With gratitude to the grace of President Obama, people across the world were fortunate to witness the hallmark of the American experience    the peaceful transfer of power.   I expect great things as President Trump puts his inaugural talk into action. Alice Stewart is a CNN political contributor and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President.  Michael Nutter: Now reach for hope    to overcome this fear, I’m sad and fearful today, not just because a great President is leaving office after performing his duties with excellence for eight years, but because there is virtually no indication that the incoming President is actually ready to lead, to inspire, to empathize, to focus, to mature, to change, to act responsibly and to truly understand the power, duty and responsibility of his new position.  Today feels like the final episode of a reality TV show, and that tomorrow we’ll all just watch something different to entertain us. Well, today is real, an election did happen, the peaceful transfer of power is complete, America is still strong and we will move on with our lives. It’s been said that hope is the only thing stronger than fear. I plan to use my unending hope in America to overcome my fears about our new President. I would encourage America and the world to do the same. Michael A. Nutter is the former mayor of Philadelphia, a  commentator on CNN, and professor at Columbia   of International and Public Affairs. Julian Zelizer: Trump still being Trump, Today’s inaugural address grew directly out of the campaign playbook. He reiterated his vision of aggressive, conservative   populism that defined what he is about. Surrounded by the leaders of Washington, he told the world that everyone in Washington had betrayed their responsibilities. It wasn’t simply the substance of the speech, but the tenor of his voice. As he stood in front of crowd of adoring supporters, as well as knowing that thousands were in Washington to protest his presidency, Trump promised that he would be a fighter unlike anything anyone has seen. For the Americans who voted for Trump the speech will be a winner. They heard in the speech the exact person they voted for and he confirmed that there will be no ”pivot” toward a more toned down style. For his opponents, and even skeptics on the fence, the speech will do nothing. They won’t forget everything that this campaign was about and the kind of advisors he is bringing into his cabinet. If there is going to be any kind of   changes, they will wait to see him actually take actions that prove he can govern in a different way. Until then, all they saw and heard was Trump still being Trump, with the big difference that he is now the President of the United States.

Salena Zito: A speech that left no doubts, After months of anticipating which version of Donald Trump would show up to deliver his inaugural speech the President of the United States remained true to his populist,   roots it lacked the soaring trappings of such moments, simplistic and strikingly strong. In short if you were inspired by his campaign speeches you were left with the promise that as president he would pursue and deliver them in your name. ”Now comes the hour of action,” he said, then pointed to fixing schools, keeping people safe and restoring the belief that America’s best days lie ahead. It was an effective, evocative speech with strong vivid language aimed at the people who have felt left behind in this country and spoke directly to them saying, ”This moment is your moment. It belongs to you,” he said. ”Jan. 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.” His solid delivery on the state of our education system and eroding manufacturing sector was powerful and he asked people to be part of something bigger than themselves which is inspiring to many Americans. It was a speech that left no doubt that there will be no rethinking whether he would enact the mythical   and   pivot he remained true to his   roots and promised to be a president of action. His repudiation of the ”American carnage” of communities impacted by gangs and drugs as part of our past, now he said it was time to look to the future, ”From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only: America first.” Salena Zito is a CNN contributor and a national political reporter for the Washington Examiner. Raul Reyes:  Trump’s missed opportunity, Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities left a lot to be desired. Instead of the   crowds he predicted, there were wide swaths of the Mall in Washington, D. C. that were empty.  Along with the procession of dignitaries and political leaders, there was   coverage of protesters, representing the majority of Americans who did not vote for Trump. The new president himself seemed to scowl through many of the activities.  And it rained. As Trump himself might have described this inaugural, it was ”sad.” It is unfair, though, to blame Trump for the poor turnout and gloomy skies. Yet at his first moment in the national spotlight as President, Trump proved a huge disappointment.  He gave a speech that was dark, pessimistic, and at times ultranationalistic.  ”Washington flourished while the people did not. .. the establishment protected itself,” he declared angrily, before the assembled members of the Washington establishment.   The stridently populist tone was ironic coming from a leader who has stocked his Cabinet with billionaires and Goldman Sachs alumni.  Much of his speech could be seen as a rebuke to the lawmakers in attendance, including former President Obama, as Trump recited a laundry list of what he thought was wrong with America: crime (actually down in the US) drugs, illegal immigration (also down).  As he was throughout his campaign, Trump on the inaugural platform was still full of putdowns.         What was notably missing from Trump’s speech is what Americans of all political affiliations crave at such historic moments: optimism and a vision for the future. The closest Trump got was exclaiming that ”America First” would be his guiding principle, a phrase that carries ugly echoes of an isolationist,   movement that urged the US to appease Hitler during World War II. His call to ”protect our border from the ravages of other countries” could be seen as playing to the xenophobia of many of his supporters.   On this pivotal day, Trump did not likely win over one viewer or listener who was not already a supporter.   Where was the sincere attempt to bring the country together?  Where was the grace or humility as he assumed the presidency?  What viewers received, instead, was a mashup of the speeches that Trump used to rally the base that    along with the Electoral College and possibly Russia    helped put him in power. Trump’s speech was more divisive rhetoric from the   incoming president in modern history. This was a tremendous lost opportunity, all because Trump cannot seem to grasp that the campaign is over.      Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors, writes frequently for CNN Opinion. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes.  Jeff Yang: The same ’  ferocity and garrulous showmanship’  Thinly attended, low energy, underwhelmingly staged —  the inaugural production was everything that Trump viscerally despises.  And yet for those who were drawn to the   ferocity and garrulous showmanship of his campaign rallies, the centerpiece of the ceremony, his own first speech as president, did not disappoint.  In it, he painted a chilling vision of an ”unstoppable” America, driven solely and expressly by  . He offered simmering threats to those who might stand in the way of his juggernaut, both domestic and foreign. He did not ask for, but demanded unity, using darkly populist language that echoed the autocratic regimes of our remembered history, from Soviet Russia to Nazi Germany —  ”rule of the people,” ”glorious destiny,” ”total allegiance.” (Some commentators even noted that Trump seemed to be channeling none other than comic book supervillain and Batman nemesis Bane.)  Imagine if his original wishes for his inaugural parade hadn’t been vetoed by the military and this speech were played back endlessly around the world as tanks and missile launchers rolled through downtown DC. Contrast this message with that of Obama’s farewell address, framed as a call not to arms but to engagement and empathy a vision of quiet strength, not preening brawn of optimism based on innovation and partnership, not economic conquest and military might.  All this is to say that I share what millions of others feel: this day is less an inauguration than a   the end of a chapter, not the beginning of one. We will surely survive the next few years to come —  but at what price to our people, our stature and our world?

John McTernan: So long, you’re on your own, No one can say they weren’t warned. President Trump’s inaugural speech told the US and the rest of the world that he would govern as he campaigned   for and on behalf of   America. The line that summed that up was: ’We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.” Across the globe, governments will have noted the looming trade war. The leader of the free world had just declared his opposition to free trade. It is one thing to do that on the campaign trail, quite another to embrace it fully in your first act as President. This is the thing though. To adapt a term from the tech industry, Mr Trump is a WYSIWYG President   What You See Is What You Get. If the closing of the American economy doesn’t worry the rest of the world, then the defence and foreign policy surely will. Just look at how starkly he put it:  ’For many decades, we’ve. .. Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military We’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own.’ That is a clear message to allies of the US   ’so long, you’re on your own.’ Mr Trump always made clear he would an American President for American people. If the world doubted that, they know now. John McTernan is a former speechwriter for   Prime Minister Tony Blair and   director to former Australia Prime Minister Julia Gillard.

As the public part of the hearing adjourned, and Comey has completely vindicated Trump ahead of a later closed session hearing where he and senators are likely to discuss classified information he could not bring up during the televised hearing, the whole thing turned out exactly like Breitbart News Network told you it would: A giant  . Except for the fact that Comey admitted he is a leaker, has a network through which he has leaked information designed to harm President Trump. Oh, and that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other Obama administration officials may have engaged in serious misconduct worthy of further investigation —  which Comey testified about today. Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders —  from the podium at the press briefing —  has told reporters that President Trump is not, despite what the leaker James Comey says, a liar. . @SHSanders45: ”No, I can definitively say the president is not a liar. It’s frankly insulting that that question would be asked.”  —   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) June 8, 2017,  And, of course, nevertheless President Trump persisted. He’s right back out there fighting for American workers while Democrats waste their time on   nonsense.

M. Sen. John McCain ( ) a grumpy old   Republican, made no sense during his questioning of Comey. Breitbart’s own Curt Schilling, the host of Whatever It Takes, questions whether everyone else had trouble following along with McCain’s nonsensical line of questioning: Am I the only one not able to follow along with senator McCain’s line of questioning? ???  —   Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) June 8, 2017,  Even the New York Times’ people questions whether McCain is losing his mind: McCain seems to be confusing the Clinton email case with the Russia investigation.  —   Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017,  Trump, who has not Tweeted during the hearing at all, apparently made the decision to avoid Tweeting last night. Politico’s Tara Palmeri has the scoop of why the President would not Tweet today, infuriating all the Union Pub   who did not get any free drinks since President Trump did not Tweet. Trump decided the night before #comeyhearings that he would not   his rebuttal https:  .   —   Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) June 8, 2017,  “Why would I?” Trump apparently told White House aides about   Comey’s appearance before Congress, according to a “senior White House official” who spoke with Politico’s Palmeri. Read the whole thing, including the details on how the president’s mood is “light” during the Comey testimony. UPDATE 12:37 P. M. Their hopes and dreams dashed by Comey completely vindicating Trump in this open hearing, and instead implicating   administration officials like Loretta Lynch —  and implicating himself as an   leaker with a network through which he has leaked damaging information against the president —  the left and media are pinning everything on a last ditch line of questioning from Sen. Kamala Harris ( ). This line of questioning from @SenKamalaHarris regarding the Attorney General is extraordinarily important  —   not to be overlooked,  —   Matt House (@mattwhouse) June 8, 2017,  Here’s video of her comparing Trump to an armed robber though, so take whatever she says with a grain of salt: Sen. Kamala Harris seems to compare Trump to an armed robber saying ”I hope you will give me your wallet” #ComeyTestimony pic. twitter.   —   Mike Ciandella ن (@MikeCiandella) June 8, 2017,  But MSNBC leftist media star Andrea Mitchell loves Kamala Harris, heavily highlighting the rookie Democrat Senator’s questions: . @KamalaHarris asks series of q’s about possible secret contacts between Trump camp and Russia #Comey declines to answer in open hearing,  —   Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile,   Never Trumper Max Boot is in an alternate reality, saying Comey was fantastic as a witness. Bottom line for #ComeyDay: Comey a highly credible witness. Trump isn’t. Comey makes damning accusations. Trump denials unconvincing.  —   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) June 8, 2017,  Flashback, though, to when Comey was fired and Boot with some bold predictions back on May 9: Congress needs to ask Comey to testify  he needs to tell all he knows about Kremlingate. If he does Trump may regret firing him.  —   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017,  Don’t tell Max Boot about the black helicopters coming for him. Seriously. “KREMLINGATE”? What is wrong with these people? Anyway, another wonderfully fantastic flashback of this Never Trumper from when Comey was fired in May: Prediction: If Democrats take control of Congress in 2018, the firing of Comey will form one of the articles of impeachment.  —   Max Boot (@MaxBoot) May 10, 2017,  UPDATE 12:24 P. M. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz is calling for the Senate to officially subpoena the documents James Comey ordered leaked through his network of leakers. Senators should ask Comey the name of the Columbia professor and then subpoena the memos from him.  —   Alan Dershowitz (@AlanDersh) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:21 P. M. Loretta Lynch is in serious trouble right now. Looks like the Democrats’ efforts may have backfired. Loretta Lynch is having a surprisingly bad day in the Comey testimony,  —   Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) June 8, 2017,  If it wasn’t for Trump becoming president, the corruption with Obama’s Department of Justice would be a major story. https:  .   —   Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) June 8, 2017,  Comey also just testified that he did not believe that Lynch could “credibly deny” the Hillary Clinton email scandal investigation, and that she had a serious conflict of interest. He also testified in exchange with Sen. John Cornyn ( ) the Senate Majority Whip, that it is possible a special prosecutor was needed for the email scandal. He said he considered calling for appointing a special counsel in the scandal, but decided against it. UPDATE 12:08 P. M. Oh my. Now confirmed leaker James Comey’s leak network has been outed, or at least part of it has: Only in Washington: Someone nursing a pint of beer shouts out to a crowded bar: ”Daniel Richman of Columbia” https:  .   —   Alexander Panetta (@Alex_Panetta) June 8, 2017,  So the collusion involves former FBI director, mainstream media, and the   academy to bring down the elected president #ComeyHearing https:  .   —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017,  And now Comey’s   leak network is confirming to the media that Comey is a leaker: Columbia Law Prof Daniel Richman confirms to @ZCohenCNN that he is the friend that provided excerpts of the Comey memo to reporters.  —   Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) June 8, 2017,    UPDATE 12:05 P. M. There are now serious questions being raised as to whether Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General from the Obama administration, will be subpoenaed to testify after this hearing where Comey has implicated her. Legit question: is Loretta Lynch going to be subpoenaed as a result of this testimony?  —   Mike Shields (@mshields007) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, Comey’s admission he is a leaker serious hurts him. Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School makes the case Comey may be in serious trouble: Comey admits that he leaked the internal memo through a Columbia law professor in order to force Special Counsel. Yet, that raises questions,  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  Comey is doing well but leaking info runs against Comey’s image, particularly in light of the leak controversy hoiunding the Administration,  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  The memos could be viewed as gov’t material and potential evidence .  Leaking to a friend for disclosure can raise serious questions.  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:02 P. M. Donald Trump, Jr. highlights an excellent question from Sen. Roy Blunt ( ) to Comey. Comey did not have a great answer. Sen Blunt: If you told Sessions you didn’t want to be alone with Trump again, why did you continue to take his calls?  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:01 P. M. From our RNC friends, here’s video of Sen. Rubio crushing another leftist media narrative during his questioning of Comey.  Basically, Comey was so concerned about President Trump’s conversations with him that he alerted exactly nobody who could do anything about it. In other words, this whole thing is a giant  . Except for Comey implicating himself as a leaker. UPDATE 11:58 A. M. Comey is in big trouble after this hearing. He admitted he’s a leaker, and has an actual network through which he leaks information to the press. In addition, he withheld from leaking information that would have vindicated President Trump weeks ago. White House social media director Dan Scavino captures it clearly and concisely on Twitter: Because if it was leaked that @realDonaldTrump was personally not under   it would have crushed the entire narrative. pic. twitter.   —   Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) June 8, 2017,  President Trump still has yet to Tweet, so no free drinks yet here at Union Pub. Looks like the owners here made a smart decision since this place is standing room only right now. UPDATE 11:54 A. M. Oh, man, this keeps getting better and better. Comey just shredded the Democrats AND now the fake news media. Oh Boy. Comey says there have been many many stories based on classified information about Russia that are just ”dead wrong”  —   Maeve Reston (@MaeveReston) June 8, 2017,  I wonder if any of the media outlets that have printed repeated stories on these matters will check their reporting again or correct it if they’re wrong. Not holding my breath. UPDATE 11:50 A. M. Comey has emerged throughout this hearing before the American people looking very much like a drama queen. One of the more memorable lines is when he says when Trump called him to ask him if he was free for dinner, he had to break a date with his wife. Comey says Trump called him at his desk. ”Free for dinner tonight? ””I said yessir  …    I had to call my wife and break a date with her.”  —   Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) June 8, 2017,  That’s not the only   Comey testimony: COMEY JUST QUOTES HENRY 11 on what he thought Trump meant: ’Will no one rid me of this toublesome priest”  —   Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, even CNN’s Jim Acosta —  a vehemently   media figure in the heart of the opposition party’s mothership CNN —  is joining in on the   fun. Giving info to media ”like feeding seagulls at the beach?” Fact check: True.  —   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:48 A. M. The leaky Capitol Hill GOP swamp aides are attacking Trump, despite the fact Comey has vindicated the president and implicated himself in potentially illegal leaks. Senate R aide: Holding nose and defending Trump is taking a lot out of these GOP senators  —   and they will demand some kind of repayment  …      —   Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) June 8, 2017,  The fact that Swamp Creatures on the “Republican” side on Capitol Hill are throwing shade on their own president, and party, as the GOP and Trump likely emerge from today’s masquerade mostly out of the woods is simply incredible but unsurprising. Swamp Things are going to Swamp. UPDATE 11:45 A. M. Comey’s open admission he orchestrated a potentially illegal leak puts him in serious potential trouble, the New York Times people note. That’s the story folks. He vindicated Trump, and implicated himself. Wow, what a day. Can’t remember the last time someone in DC openly acknowledged orchestrating a leak  —   and without any senator having even asked.  —   Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:39 A. M. CNN’s Dan Merica says that President Trump’s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz will make a statement at the end of Comey’s public testimony. Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s lawyer outside the White House, will make a statement at the end of James Comey’s Senate testimony,  —   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:35 A. M. As Comey continues vindicating Trump and throwing Democrats like Lynch, Obama, and Clinton under the bus —  presumably accidentally —  the Washington, D. C. daydrinking party scene is in full swing: Spotted at Duffy’s Irish Pub in North DC:”Comey is my homey.” pic. twitter.   —   Sharon Nunn (@sharonmnunn) June 8, 2017,  Her “homey” James Comey, meanwhile, has actually admitted he is a leaker. Flag: Comey says he had a friend of his leak the content of his memo to a reporter to hopefully prompt the appointment of a special counsel. pic. twitter.   —   Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017,  Comey admits to @SenatorCollins that he asked a friend to leak the contents of his memo to NYT to prompt the appointment of Special Counsel.  —   Joel B.

M. While obstruction is now off the table for Trump, as Breitbart’s Joel Pollak detailed, Breitbart’s John Hayward notes that obstruction is back on the table for several leading officials from now former President Barack Obama’s administration. Hayward says Congress needs to investigate Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General, as well as Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton —  the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee —  for obstruction of justice. Big takeaway from the Comey hearing: urgent need to investigate Loretta Lynch, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton for obstruction,  —   John Hayward (@Doc_0) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:29 A. M. Our very own Joel Pollak is out with another bombshell piece detailing how this hearing has shattered the media’s and the Democrats’ efforts to taint President Trump with “obstruction of justice. ” “Democrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment  —   and reversing the 2016 elections  —   on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice. That case has now been smashed beyond repair,” Pollak writes, pointing to a Comey exchange with Sen. Jim Risch ( ). Read his whole story here. UPDATE 11:26 A. M. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who has trolled Trump as much as he possibly can over the campaign and since, is joining with Union Pub patrons —  who get free drinks if President Trump Tweets about the Comey hearing —  in raising concerns with the lack of Tweets today from President Trump. . @realDonaldTrump’s silence on #ComeyDay concerns me. What’s  going on, Don? I hope you don’t hurt your fingers ranting against Comey later.  —   Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:25 A. M. Entirely unsurprising, but leading Never Trumper Ana Navarro bashes the president —  again —  and praises Comey. Lot of time left, but so far, Comey is coming across as the consummate professional. A man who loves his country, colleagues  agency.  —   Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:24 A. M. Since Comey has blown up the entire media narrative, essentially, Ric Grenell —  a leading conservative   advocate —  notes that the media is only using “facts” that fit their worldview. Breaking: DC reporters are NOT tweeting the line where Comey destroys their anonymous sourced narratives.  —   Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) June 8, 2017,  Kayleigh McEnany, one of the only   voices on the opposition party network CNN, Tweets another homerun: Of all the leaks, the one thing that never leaked was that the President was NOT under investigation.   Very suspicious! #ComeyDay,  —   Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) June 8, 2017,  And Ann Coulter for the win: OBVIOUSLY Trump’s request re: Flynn was to “let go” of Trump’s firing of him. MSM was falsely claiming reason 4 firing was contacts w Russia,  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:21 A. M. from this morning’s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXMTom Fitton of Judicial Watch,  says there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by President Trump or his team. And he called the special counsel “wasteful. ” If Robert Mueller, the special counsel, comes up with nothing as every one of his contemporaries has before him, it will be the biggest waste of taxpayer dollars —  and of Americans’ time —  in a long time. Listen to the audio here, or at the link to the story from our own Dan Riehl: UPDATE 11:16 A. M. James Comey finally confirms before a congressional committee in a public setting —  on video —  that President Donald Trump is not under FBI investigation. James Comey confirms President Trump was not under investigation while he was FBI director https:  .  https:  .   —   CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:15 A. M. During Comey’s back and forth with Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) the former 2016 Trump GOP primary rival astutely noted that basically the only thing that did not leak to the press is the one fact that would have helped Trump —  that Trump himself was not under investigation. That is despite the fact that Congressional leaders were briefed on that point. Rubio Comey back forth indicates Gang of 8 was briefed that Trump was not personally under investigation.  —   Laura Rozen (@lrozen) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:11 A. M. Donald Trump, Jr. joins the fray on Twitter, defending his father —  the president —  from Comey’s ambiguous claims.   Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well. I hear ”I hope nothing happens but you have to do your job”  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,    very far from any kind of coercion or influence and certainly not obstruction!  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  Trump, Jr. says there is no way Comey would have misunderstood the president.   Knowing my father for 39 years when he ”orders or tells” you to do something  there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  He also notes that Comey has testified that he could be “wrong. ” Comey ”I could be wrong”  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  Donald Trump, Jr. ’s Tweets come as many here at Union Pub —  who will get free drinks if the president himself Tweets about Comey —  are disappointed that President Trump himself is not Tweeting. This is probably the first time ever that people in Washington, D. C. —  the Swamp —  are upset that President Donald Trump is NOT Tweeting. UPDATE 11:10 A. M. Video of Comey wishing there are tapes of his conversations with Trump: Comey: ”I’ve seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes.” (via @MSNBC) pic. twitter.   —   Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:07 A. M. Breitbart’s Joel Pollak has an excellent piece up already on how Comey’s opening statement to the Committee this morning is all about him. “Former FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about ‘shifting explanations’ for why he had been fired, and by attacking the Trump administration,” Pollak writes. “Comey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administration’s statements about the matter ‘confused me and increasingly concerned me.’ He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay. ” Read the whole thing. Also, it’s worth noting that even the Wall Street Journal —  not some rightwing blog by any stretch —  even says that Comey’s written opening statement proves that President Trump should have fired him. Which is exactly what President Trump did. Read the Journal’s editorial board piece here. UPDATE 11: 00 A. M. The GOP war room is up and running. Our friends over at the Republican National Committee are cutting videos that shows Comey’s testimony actually fully vindicates President Trump, despite whatever the opposition party media and congressional Democrats say:  Politico has an RNC talking points document circulated this morning. Read the whole thing here. Politico also has a story on how the RNC is taking the lead on pushing back on the highly discredited Comey’s testimony. “The RNC’s role is to support and defend the president and this White House and this week is no different,” Ryan Mahoney, the RNC communications director, told Politico. “And we prepare for everything, and we’re prepared for the hearing this week. ” Read the whole piece here. UPDATE 10:59 A. M. Despite the fact there have been a number of inaccurate pieces throughout the establishment media, the establishment media is celebrating itself. Most interesting part of Comey memo: How damn good the reporting has been. On. The. Nose.  —   Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) June 8, 2017,  Also, fun: Sen. Feinstein wearing a seersucker: First seersucker sighting at #ComeyHearing! We see you, @SenFeinstein. 💯 pic. twitter.   —   ClotureClub. com (@ClotureClub) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:57 A. M. Feinstein tells Comey he’s “big” and “strong,” then asks him if he was overwhelmed by the Oval Office and wonders why he did not tell the president he was wrong when he brought this subject up with him. He questions whether he would have handled himself the same way if given a second chance. “I hope there are tapes,” Comey also said of his meetings with Trump, noting he has seen the president’s Tweet about the possibility of tapes. UPDATE 10:55 A. M. Comey, under questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( ) says his relationship with Trump got off to a rocky start. He also embarrasses her when she asks him if the reason he was fired had anything to do with the Russia investigation, and he said “yes, because the President said so. ” Here in Union Pub, the   crowd broke out into laughter. UPDATE 10:53 A. M. Comey just killed the case against Trump over “obstruction of justice” that the media is building, as fast as they began building it. He said Trump saying he hopes Comey lets the investigation of Flynn go was not an order to drop the investigation. UPDATE 10:51 A. M. The media is highlighting two separate things early on in the Comey bonanza: The fired former FBI director’s use of the word “lie” twice, and him being concerned about meetings with President Trump. Establishment media going to do their thing. Comey has now used ”lie” twice. 1. Referring to WH defaming him and the FBI: ”those were lies”:2. His concern POTUS might ”lie” about mtg,  —   Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) June 8, 2017,  ”I was honestly concerned [Pres. Trump] might lie about the nature of our meeting.”  —   James Comey on why he kept records of his meetings pic. twitter.   —   Good Morning America (@GMA) June 8, 2017,  Flag: Comey doesn’t want to opine on Trump trying to obstruct, but says ”That’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work toward.” pic. twitter.   —   Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017,  An extraordinary thing for an   director to say about the President of the United States https:  .   —   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:48 A. M. Since Comey has nothing, and the whole case is falling apart, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s   Brian Fallon is sadly offering up that special counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Trump. WH plan of declaring victory because Trump was not being investigated in January is now moot. Comey made clear Mueller is investing him now,  —   Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017,  But, sadly, if they have no evidence Trump colluded with the Russians —  probably because it is likely no evidence even exists —  then the special prosecutor will find the same thing that Comey found: NOTHING. But, nevertheless Hillary Clinton’s acolytes persisted: Comey said he expects Mueller to assess, as part of his investigation, whether Trump obstructed justice. That would mean he’s a subject now.  —   Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:40 A. M. Comey testified that he was “confused” about being fired by President Trump. And he said Trump spread “lies” about the FBI. Comey describes being “confused” by firing, “lies” about FBI being in disarray pic. twitter.   —   Washington Post (@washingtonpost) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:38 A. M. Since Comey believes that no votes were altered in the 2016 presidential election —  he testified he is “confident” none were —  then what is the point of this hearing? #Comey says that he is ”confident” that no votes in 2016 were altered #ComeyHearing,  —   Brooke Singman (@brookefoxnews) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:32 A. M. Despite the fact that Comey has nothing, but instead actually ended up in his written opening statement vindicating President Trump, the media elites in Washington are celebrating Comey’s “poker face” —  as if it means something substantive. James Comey’s poker face is savage. #ComeyTestimony,  —   Michelle Ruiz (@michelleruiz) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:30 A. M. As Comey comes under questions from Burr, our very own Joel Pollak notes that Comey’s altered opening statement was a deeply personal statement furthering the giant nothingburger he put out last night through the committee. Comey failing again so far, just like he did when he was working on the Hillary Clinton email scandal last year. So far the Comey testimony is all about him  all about political retribution against the president for firing him. Disgraceful performance,  —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:26 A. M. Washington, D. C. elites are having a ball for themselves.

We’ll get updates up soon. UPDATE 10:20 A. M. Audible gasps of disappointment were heard throughout Union Pub as Comey said he will not   his opening statement published online last night, a statement that completely vindicated President Trump. Comey, however, admits that the President can fire him whenever he wants. He also says that he heard Donald Trump thought he was doing a “great job. ” But here in Union Pub, cheers erupted as a champagne bottle was popped open for more Washington, D. C. mimosas. UPDATE 10:17 A. M. As Warner wraps his righteous opening statement, in which he stated “this is not a witch hunt” and “this is not fake news,” the STANDING ROOM ONLY crowd at Union Pub laughs as Comey is forced by the chairman to stand and be sworn in under oath for his testimony. UPDATE 10:15 A. M. This real life parody is getting more and more out of control. Fired  . S. Attorney from the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara is joining Comey in the hearing room. Yes, that is Preet Bharara sitting behind James Comey. Banquo’s ghost.  —   Charles P. Pierce (@CharlesPPierce) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, our COVFEFE LIVEWIRE has earned the attention of New York Times media correspondent Michael Grynbaum. Breitbart’s @mboyle1 is at Union Pub in DC to cover “the reaction of the crowd of Washington elites” https:  .   —   Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:12 A. M. Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate committee, opens up with his opening statement saying that this hearing has drawn focus from a lot of Washington, D. C. and that ordinary Americans really don’t care and aren’t paying attention. Maybe Congress could focus on real policy issues when this charade is over, but that would probably be asking too much of our elected representatives. UPDATE 10:11 A. M. Fox News is reporting that President Trump is expected to issue a statement disputing parts of Comey’s testimony. UPDATE 10:10 A. M. Burr to Comey: “The American people need to hear your side of the story. ” UPDATE 10:04 A. M. As Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, opens the hearing, a hush comes over the crowd inside Union Pub. COVFEFE everyone! Here we go. UPDATE 10:03 A. M. James Comey has walked into the room where is going to testify in the Senate Intelligence Committee. Folks at Union Pub don’t really seem to care much as they are engaged in deep conversation, very loudly, so loud one cannot hear the television. UPDATE 10:02 A. M. Comey’s written testimony published last night basically proved he had nothing on Trump, and this whole case is going nowhere. Even   Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) admits that, saying none of this makes any sense on TV this morning. ”Nobody in their right mind who believed they had a case, would take their star witness  allow them to go before the nation”  —   Sen. Graham pic. twitter.   —   CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:00 A. M. Union Pub is up and running as the Comey hearing is about to begin.

Individuals earning more than $250, 000 (or $500, 000 if filing jointly) will not be eligible for the deduction. For a family earning $70, 000 per year in the 12 percent tax bracket with $7, 000 in child care expenses, the deduction would reduce taxes by $840 per year.• The plan will offer child care spending rebates to   taxpayers through the existing Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This could mean almost $1, 200 per year per eligible family.• Mr. Trump’s plan will ensure    parents will receive the same tax deduction as working parents, offering compensation for the job they’re already doing, and allowing them to choose the child care scenario that’s in their best interest. PROPOSAL: The Trump plan would create new Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) so that families can set aside extra money to foster their children’s development and offset elder care for their parents or adult dependents. These new accounts are available to everyone, and allow both   contributions and   appreciation     current law Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) which are available only if it is offered by an employer and does not allow balances to accumulate.• When established for a minor, funds from a DCSA can be applied to traditional child care,   enrichment programs and school   to school choice. To help   parents, the government will match half of the first $1, 000 deposited per year.• When established for an elderly dependent, a DCSA can cover a variety of services, including   nursing and   care. PROPOSAL: Mr. Trump’s plan will provide regulatory reform to promote new   and   solutions, and also add incentives for employers to provide child care at the workplace. The ability to set aside funds will be particularly helpful to women,   workers and minorities, who are statistically more likely to reduce time working outside the home in order to provide unpaid care. PROPOSAL: The Trump plan will guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave by amending the existing unemployment insurance (UI) that companies are required to carry. The benefit would apply only when employers don’t offer paid maternity leave, and would be paid for by offsetting reductions in the program so that taxes are not raised. This enhancement will triple the average paid leave received by new mothers. Frequently Asked Questions About The Trump Child Care PlanQ: How Will The Plan Be Paid For?• The child care plan is part of the comprehensive tax, trade, energy and regulation reform plan proposed by Donald Trump at the Detroit Economic Club. More details about his tax plan will be discussed later this week at the New York Economic Club. The child care plan itself can more than be offset by additional growth. About   of the entire Trump tax reform program will offset by the increases in economic activity that accompany   tax reform, better trade deals, regulatory and immigration reform, and unleashing American energy. The remaining   will be offset by minor changes in the current trajectory of spending for federal agency operations, excluding Defense, Veterans, Social Security and Medicare. Q: Will The Benefits Already Provided For Child Care Expenses, Like The Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account And Child Tax Credit, Be Eliminated Under The Trump Plan?• No, the benefits provided by the Trump child care plan are in addition to the benefits available under current law. Current programs do not serve the large numbers of families that would benefit from the Trump plan, but if a family finds that it benefits more from existing programs, they would still be available. The only restriction would be that the same child care spending cannot be used for multiple benefits programs —  no  . Q: Will   Couples Receive The Benefits?• The benefits would be available in the same way that the IRS currently recognizes   couples: if the marriage is recognized under state law, then it is recognized under federal law. Q: Will The Maternity Leave Policy Cause Employers To View Women As Less Desirable Employees Because Of Paid Leave?• No. The cost to an employer of hiring should not be affected by this   policy, so the employer should not view hiring women as adding to their costs of Unemployment Insurance. Further, employers in a competitive marketplace should not eliminate existing maternity care benefits to instead take advantage of the UI system. The UI benefit would only equal what would be paid to a   employee, which is much less than a workers’ regular paycheck. This should prevent abuse while providing a safety net for the sake of the health of mother and child. Donald J. Trump’s Plan Is More Complete Than Hillary Clinton’s Plan, Point One: Hillary Clinton does not have a plan to provide relief to most Americans faced with high child care costs. She claims she wants to cap a family’s child care expense at 10 percent of income, but provides no details. The Trump plan would provide relief to every   and   earner who has child care expenses. For example, the Trump plan would reduce taxes by $840 per year a family for earning $70, 000 per year in the 12 percent tax bracket with $7, 000 in child care expenses Hillary Clinton’s plan would provide no relief to this family. Point Two: Hillary Clinton prefers institutional child care that does not meet the needs of workers in rural areas or who have schedules that require working on a night shift or on call. The Trump plan would give states the flexibility to establish standards that fit the needs of state residents without compromising quality. Point Three: Hillary Clinton would force businesses to pay for 12 weeks of   family leave at their expense. The Trump plan proposes 6 weeks of partial pay through the existing Unemployment Insurance system, fully paid for within the program.   6:45: Many minority millennials who can’t stand Clinton and Trump seem very open to voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein: ”Instead of a war on poverty, they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me.”  —   #TupacShakur,  —   Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) September 13, 2016,  6:40: Gary Johnson with former Indiana Governor, Bush ally, and Purdue President Mitch Daniels at an event: Presidential candidate Gary Johnson has an open discussion with Purdue president Mitch Daniels#GaryJohnson #Purdue pic. twitter.   —   The Purdue Review (@PurdueReview) September 13, 2016,  6:35: Former RNC Chair Marc Racicot says Gary Johnson should be included in the debates as Johnson announces he will be on the ballot in every state: Libertarian Gary Johnson’s campaign announces candidate will be on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.

There’s one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that’s Donald Trump. Not only has Trump embraced Putin, he publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign. Like so many of the words Trump has uttered this election season, his statements encouraging cybercrime are dangerous, divisive, and unprecedented. 4:20: In Florida, Trump gets 29% of the Hispanic vote and Clinton is seven points behind where Obama was with Hispanics in 2012. According to the report, “Clinton is also underperforming compared to Obama in three other heavily Hispanic swing states polled: Arizona, Colorado and Nevada. ” Nearly half of Florida’s Hispanics think Clinton is a “liar. ” The poll by   Bendixen  Amandi International and The Tarrance Group shows Clinton drawing 53 percent among Florida Hispanics, compared to Trump’s 29 percent. That’s a significant   lead. But Obama hit 60 percent among Latinos in 2012, according to exit polls. He defeated Mitt Romney in Florida by a single percentage point. “She should not only be where Obama is  —   she should be beating those numbers, and she’s not,” pollster Fernand Amandi told the Miami Herald.

Whites with no college experience have become 14 points more likely to affiliate with the GOP since 2008, including a   shift over the last four years. White voters age 65 and older are now 13 points more likely to identify as Republican or lean Republican than they were eight years ago. ” [Older voters are a safer bet to turn out to vote than younger voters, especially with Obama not on the ballot.] 3:00:   group uses Reagan against Trump in new ad: 2:25: Trump to visit Flint on Wednesday: Donald Trump heading back to Michigan to visit Flint tomorrow.

He vows to rebuild our “very depleted military” and take care of our vets while saving the Second Amendment, which is “under siege. ” 2:09: Obama is trying to defend Clinton’s “transparency” and foundation. That’s a sell that even Obama may not be able to make to voters. 2:07: Someone just fainted at Obama rally. He tells crowd to drink water, ”bend your knees.”  —   Brad Mielke (@TheBradMielke) September 13, 2016,  2:06: Interesting admission from one of the mainstream media’s “ ” state reporters. It wasn’t long ago when these folks said there was no way that Trump could win the election. Mainstream media reporters ignore the many positive aspects about Trump’s message about taking back our communities, providing more jobs to   Americans of all backgrounds, putting the interests of Americans of all backgrounds first, and keeping the country safe from terrorism. ”He’s betting if he scares enough people, he might just scare up enough votes to win.”  —  POTUS on TrumpIndeed.

Trump promises that the White House will become the “people’s house. ” He vows to fix our crumbling infrastructure and renegotiate our horrible trade deals. Trump says prosperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will grow rapidly. Trump says this is a campaign about “big ideas designed to help everyday people. ” 1:51: Obama slams the “dark” vision of the GOP. It’s funny that almost every mainstream media reporter and pundit instantaneously painted Trump’s convention speech as “dark” as if they had coordinated responses ready as soon as Trump was done speaking at the GOP convention. He says this election is about the “very meaning of America. ” Obama says he is “really into electing Hillary Clinton. ” “Hillary” chants not as enthusiastic as reception for Obama. Obama: This election ”is a fundamental choice about who we are as a people. This is a fundamental choice about the very meaning of America.”  —   Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) September 13, 2016,  1:50: In Iowa, Rudy Giuliani is slamming Clinton’s email scandal while introducing Trump. “It is a source of tremendous disappointment that the Department of Justice  …    . has perverted itself so much  …     that it was unable to bring a case against her  …     when I know in my heart that case would have been brought against anyone else,” he says. “That’s what you call corruption in government. ” He also slams the Clinton Foundation scandals. 1:45: Obama says this campaign season has been a crazier than usual. Crowd, as always, seems more enthusiastic about Obama than Clinton. Obama claims Republicans don’t like to hear “good news” and claims incomes are rising and poverty is falling across America. He also cites the low gas prices and says “thanks, Obama!” 1:40: Obama takes the stage in Philadelphia and mentions that Vice President Joe Biden told him to get on the “Wentz Wagon,” referring to Carson Wentz, the Eagles’ rookie quarterback who won his debut against Cleveland.

[Miller is perhaps the one Trump surrogate who is ready for prime time and can spar with the mainstream media’s best.] 6:15: Miller says the most important factor regarding foreign policy is philosophy. He says Trump’s philosophy is “America First,” which means NATO will have to pay its fair share and no nation building. He says Clinton represents an “internationalist,   foreign policy” that seeks to   with American blood and dollars. Miller says “you have to send a message to our allies” that they have to pay their fair shares instead of being freeloaders. Miller says Clinton represents a failed “  consensus” that has proven to be “disastrous. ” Miller points out that Clinton, as Secretary of State, allowed her husband to give speeches Chinese government entities while those entities had business before Clinton’s State Department. He notes that all of this is documented in Breitbart News Senior    and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer’s Clinton Cash book. Miller says the Chinese government funneled money into the Clinton’s bank account while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. “That is corruption on a scale beyond imagination,” Miller tells Wolf Blitzer. 6:10: On CNN, Trump’s Senior Adviser Stephen Miller says that Clinton’s decision to make this a referendum on foreign policy is the worst decision since her Libya policy. She says before   Obama was choked off by sanctions while Iraq was stabilizing. Miller says Iran is closer than ever to a nuclear weapon, Libya is in disarray, Syria is a failed state with 4 million refugees, and a more belligerent and a hostile North Korea. Miller says Clinton’s foreign policy signature is a “trail of blood and death” and says there is chaos, destruction, and death everywhere after four years of Clinton’s foreign policy. 5:55: Line to get into Trump’s San Jose event reportedly formed at 8:30 AM PST: Rep.

She says making the right call takes a “cool head” and “respect for the facts” and a “willingness to listen” to other’s points of view with humility. She says it also takes someone who understands he doesn’t know everything because someone who thinks he does won’t ask the tough questions.

But Malek points out that Trump needs to exert more discipline on the campaign trail and needs to stop taking two steps forward and then two steps back. Malek wrote a column this week in the Washington Post urging Trump to stop attacking fellow Republicans after Trump eviscerated New Mexico Gov.

He says the AP’s report that Clinton has the delegates to secure the nomination will only depress voter turnout in California. 5:35: Tony Lee: As I said during the primary season, Trump can wing his way to the GOP nomination but he needs seasoned advisers who get politics to help him combat the mainstream   Clinton machine. Trump’s been lucky on numerous levels —  even the media hoopla surrounding his comments about Judge Curiel has inadvertently   what would have been a night where the mainstream press gave    coverage to Hillary Clinton’s “historic” nomination. 5:15: And here’s Jeb Bush joining the GOP establishment chorus to slamm Trump’s “racism. ” 5:10: Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook tells Chuck Todd on “MTP Daily” that “the math is clear” that Clinton will be the nominee. He says they will celebrate the “historic nature” of Clinton’s victory tonight. Trying not to offend any of Sanders’s supporters, Mook says it’s too early to talk about conventions and roll calls. 5:05: On MSNBC, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says if Sanders wins California, it will “strengthen the argument” for Sanders to take the nomination fight to the convention. He claims that Sanders also has a “strong commitment” to party unity. 4:35: Trump realizes importance of tonight’s speech: Teleprompters  set up for @realDonaldTrump election night remarks.

Weaver punts a bit when asked why super delegates should go against the will of the Dem. electorate. [It’s a bit bizarre that Sanders and his campaign seem to want the nomination at the end when they started the campaign acting like they had no intention of winning the nomination, even giving Hillary Clinton a complete pass on her email scandal and taking her scandals off of the table. ] 4:15: Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval jumps in, saying that he can’t defend the “indefensible” and “cannot at this time” say that he can vote for Trump. 4:10: An Iowa State GOP Senator suspended his party membership to protest Trump’s “racist remarks. ” 4:08: Team Sanders is defiant, and they may be more so if they pull out a win in California later tonight. 4:05: Trump says he will not comment on the Trump University case any further and states that his “comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. ” It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that one’s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial. Over the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University. There are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report. Throughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions. And, the response from students was overwhelming. Over a five year period, more than 10, 000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump University’s programs. For example: Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump University’s   seminar “excellent” in every category, but also praised Trump University’s mentorship program in a glowing 5 plus minute video testimonial. When asked “how could Trump University help to meet [her] goals” she simply stated “[c]ontinue to offer great classes. ” Once the plaintiffs’ lawyers realized how disastrous a witness she was, they asked to have her removed from the case. Over my lawyers’ objections, the judge granted the plaintiffs’ motion, but allowed the case to continue. Art Cohen, a lead plaintiffs in the litigation, completed a survey in which he not only rated Trump University’s   seminar “excellent” in virtually every category, but went so far as to indicate that he would “attend another Trump University seminar” and even “recommend Trump University seminars to a friend. ” When asked how Trump University could improve the seminar, Mr. Cohen’s only suggestion was to “[h]ave lunch sandwiches brought in” and make the lunch break 45 minutes. Former student Bob Giullo, who has been critical of Trump University in numerous interviews and negative  from my political opponents, also expressed his satisfaction, rating Trump University’s programs “excellent” in every category. When asked how Trump University could improve its programs, Mr. Giullo simply asked that students be provided “more comfortable chairs. ” Indeed, these are just a few of literally thousands of positive surveys, all of which can be viewed online at www. 98percentapproval. com. For those students who decided that Trump University’s programs were not for them, the company had a generous refund policy, offering a full refund to any student who asked for their money back within 3 days of signing up for a program or by the end of the first day of any   program, whichever came later. Normally, legal issues in a civil case would be heard in a neutral environment. However, given my unique circumstances as nominee of the Republican Party and the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration, jobs and unfair trade, I have concerns as to my ability to receive a fair trial. I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies  —   like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier  —   are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage. Due to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the Judge’s reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the Obama appointed Judge’s impartiality. It is a fair question. I hope it is not the case. While this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November. I do not intend to comment on this matter any further. With all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!   4:00: Just when it seemed like Democrats had all of the chaos on their side, establishment Republicans and the “Never Trump” Smart Set seized on Trump’s attacks on Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel to 1) grandstand in order to get the affection of the mainstream media and the Beltway elite and 2) again float the possibility of denying Trump the nomination at the GOP convention. House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) called Trump’s remarks about Judge Curiel the “textbook definition of racism” while Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) said they were “ ” and added that “if anybody was looking for an   this is probably it. ” Establishment Republican Sen. Mark Kirk ( ) took back his endorsement and Tweeted that Trump does not have the temperament to command the country’s nuclear arsenal. Given my military experience, Donald Trump does not have the temperament to command our military or our nuclear arsenal.  —   Mark Kirk (@MarkKirk) June 7, 2016,  The former chair of the Iowa GOP Tweeted that the GOP needs someone to step up to wrest the nomination away from Trump, a sentiment that is being echoed by the “Never Trump” Smart Set inside the Beltway.

       "        <td>The Republican presidential candidates debate tonight in North Charleston, South Carolina less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.  Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum will participate in the undercard debate, which starts at 6 PM EST on Fox Business Network. Sen. Rand Paul ( ) was bumped from the main even and will boycott the debate. Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Ohio Governor John Kasich will be in the main event. Cruz and Trump are in a dead heat in Iowa. And both need to be careful to not alienate potential crossover supporters in the debate if they attack the other. Trump has raised the issue of whether Cruz is a “  citizen” who is qualified to be President and Cruz has the chance to put the issue to rest on the national state. Cruz has been attacking Trump’s “New York values,” and it will be interesting to see whether Cruz goes for a knockout punch, which could also leave himself open to a counterpunch that could KO him, against Trump. Cruz needs to win Iowa in order to have as much momentum as possible going into the “SEC primary. ” Cruz’s organization in the South puts him in a strong position to do well, but he needs to still be viable by then. Though Trump has a huge lead in New Hampshire, one can argue that it makes complete sense for his campaign to go   in Iowa and seek to effectively end the GOP primary with a big win there. Messrs. Bush, Christie, Kasich, and Rubio are battling in New Hampshire to emerge as the trying to emerge as the establishment’s    alternative. And they may focus less on the frontrunners and more on highlighting their differences. Carson, who has faded after being at the top of the polls and whose campaign is on the ropes, must save his candidacy and needs a moment in this debate that will allow him to do so. Because there are fewer candidates on stage, viewers may finally get a much more substantive   devoid of much of the “freak show” elements of politics. Trish Regan and Sandra Smith will moderate the undercard debate. Neil Cavuto and Maria Bartiromo will moderate the main event. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. Closing Statements: Trump says he stood yesterday with 75 construction workers who are tough, strong, great people. He says half of them had tears pouring down their face watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors in Iran. He said it was a “terrible sight” and “there won’t be stupid deals anymore” and “we will win on everything we do” if he is president. Cruz says that “13 Hours” will debut tomorrow about the brave men who fought for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians who betrayed them. Cruz blasts Obama for not saying “radical Islamic terrorism” and sending billions to Iran. He blasts Clinton for apologizing for saying “all lives matter. ” Cruz says “this will end on January 2017″ and he will have the backs of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, police officers, and first responders, and firefighters who risk their lives to keep us safe. ” Rubio says America was founded on the principle that our rights come from God and not from government. Rubio says as he travels the country, people tell him that they feel like they are being left behind. He says the reason is simple —  in 2008, America elected a president who wants to change America instead of fixing America and make it more like the rest of the world. Rubio accuses Obama of undermining the Constitution and betraying our allies. A solid closing argument from Rubio. Carson says that in his recent travels around the country, he has encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry because America’s freedoms are slipping away. He says “we’re not going to solve this problem with traditional politics” but with “we the people. ” Carson says we will “heal, inspire, and revive” America for our children. Christie says he his thinking about the Americans who watched Obama talk about fantasyland when they know that the country is not respected anymore. He says Obama doesn’t feel their pain and Christie will “be a fighter for this country again. ” He talks about  how he has been a fighter his whole life. He says we will make America much more exceptional by making sure Hillary Clinton never gets in the White House. Bush says results count and Americans can count on him to keep America “safer, stronger, freer. ” He cites his record in Florida and his “detailed plans” on ISIS. Bush asks for support to build together a safer, stronger America. Kasich says he has fought to give voice to people who grew up with him and those who elected him. He talks about welfare reform, Pentagon reform, taking on special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio. He says that’s who is in his mind’s eye and he will continue to fight for those who think they can get their voice back. 11:07 PM: Bartiromo finally asks Rubio about immigration. She says under current law, America is on pace to issue more green cards in the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. She notes that the CBO found that his “Gang of Eight” bill would have increased green cards by another ten million. She asks him bluntly, “why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?” Rubio says the issue has been debated for 30 years. His mind is spinning on how to avoid answering the question. He says the immigration question has to be about keeping America safe. He says radical Islamic Jihadists are recruiting doctors, engineers, and even fiancees. He says America’s top priority should be to not let ISIS get terrorists into the United States. Bartiromo just asked the question because she had to, but does a terrible   job. The debate could have had a very substantive discussion on   but, predictably, viewers did not get that. Rubio says the issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. He says the entire legal immigration system must be reexamined for security reasons. Cruz says “radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago,” He notes that he stood with Messrs.   to stop Rubio’s amnesty bill because “border security is national security. ” Rubio accuses Cruz of having supported doubling the number of green cards and increasing   by 500%. Rubio says Cruz used to support legalizing illegal immigrants and birthright citizenship and “now you oppose it. ” He says that is not “consistent conservatism. ” He slams Cruz for calling Snowden a “great public servant. ” He says every time there is a defense bill in the Senate, Rand Paul, Bernie Sanders, and Cruz team up to vote against it. Cruz says he appreciates Rubio dumping his   folder. Cruz says that Rubio stood with   on amnesty and he stood with  . Cruz points out that Rubio still supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, taking Rubio to task and holding Rubio accountable in a way that the moderators should have. Immigration is the top issue in the GOP primary. There should have been much more time devoted to a substantive debate on the matter. Absolutely terrible. 11:05PM:   Paul Protesters briefly interrupt Cavuto as he asks Kasich a question about Chicago’s move to retrain police officers to not use their guns as quickly. He says he created a task force to bring together law enforcement, community members, the clergy, etc. Kasich says they sat down as a group and gave him 23 recommendations. One of them, he says, is statewide guidelines on the use of deadly force. Another is on hiring and recruiting and more resources for training. He says there needs to be more integration between  . He says the community needs to understand that the police officer wants to get home at night and not to lose their life  and the police needs to understand that there are people in the community think the system doesn’t work for them and actually works against them. Kasich says people need to realize that protest is fine but violence is wrong. 11:03 PM: Cavuto asks Christie about violent crime spiking in cities across the country and what he would do to address that and the concerns police have about being sued, etc. Christie says FBI Director Jim Comey said a chill wind is blowing through law enforcement because Obama and both of his attorneys general “gives the benefit of the doubt to the criminal and not the police officer. ” Christie says Obama believes “law enforcement are the bad guys. ” Christie says “sanctuary cities are a part of the problem. ” He blasts Obama for not enforcing marijuana laws. Christie says he would appoint an Attorney General and would order his AG to enforce the “law against everyone justly, aggressively, fairly” and let police officers know “how proud we are of them. ” 11 PM: Bartiromo asks Trump how difficult it will be to disentangle himself from his   and prioritize America’s interest first. “If I become President, I couldn’t care less about my company. It’s peanuts,” Trump says. He says he wants to make America rich and great again and he has his children run the company. “I’m going to do it for America,” Trump says. Trump says his children and executives would run his   and would not care about anything except America. 10:49: Rubio is asked about entitlement reform. Rubio says the tax issue is related to the entitlement issue. He differentiates himself from Cruz by saying he will not have a   tax. Rubio says the VAT tax is a way to “blindfold the people so the true cost of government is not there for them. ” Rubio says what is there to prevent a future liberal   from raising the income tax and the VAT tax, if it is instituted. He says he is going to side with Ronald Reagan and not Nancy Pelosi on the issue. Cruz says that “Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks,” but his “business flat tax” is not a VAT tax. Cruz says the 16% business flat tax will allow for the death tax, the corporate income tax, the payroll tax, the Obamacare taxes. Cruz says his tax plan gives every American a simple flat tax rate of 10% (he says Rubio’s top tax rate is 35%) and enables Americans to fill out their taxes on a postcard “so we can abolish the IRS” while Rubio’s leaves the IRS in place. “We need to break the Washington cartel,” he says. “And the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all the mandates and have a simple flat tax. ” Cruz says that Art Laffer has praised Cruz’s tax plan as the best. Rubio claims that he is not accurately describing his plan because there will be some agency that will collect what he says is Cruz’s VAT tax. He warns against a liberal   raising the   tax. “Now we have Europe,” he says. Christie says he is the only one on the stage who put forth a detailed entitlement reform program that will save Social   without raising taxes. 10:47: Carson is asked about U. S. companies having $2 trillion overseas. He is asked what he will do stop companies from leaving America because of its high corporate tax rate. Carson talks up his flat tax plan. He says “we have to stop spending so much money” and fix the taxation system, get rid of regulations because “every regulation is a tax on goods and services” and “it’s the most regressive tax there is. ” Carson says the “evil government” and not the “evil rich people” that are destroying the economy. Trump adds that corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. 10:45: Bartiromo asks Christie what his plan is to fix America’s infrastructure without raising taxes. Christie says a   8. 75% tax on repatriated funds will be dedicated to building up Ameriaca’s infrastructure and creating more American jobs. Christie says Obama has “penalized corporations in America” and what that does is hurt   taxpayers. Trump says Jeb would be a “weak president. ” His “ ” jab on Jeb was KO shot. Trump blasts the New York Times for saying that he would impose a 45% tariff on China. He says that China has “total control of North Korea and they can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to” but instead they “taunt us. ” He says China is “ripping us on tried, they are devaluing their currencies, and they’re killing our companies. ” He says America has lost   million jobs because of China and cites America’s $5. 5 billion trade deficit with China. Trump says we have great economic power over China and if we wanted to use that  …     He says the 45% tariff figure would balance China’s devaluing its currency. Caveat asks Trump whether he would be open to tariffs on Chinese goods, and, he rarely sidesteps the question as Cavuto tries to pin him down. Trump says that China taxes American when it deals with American goods. Trump says since “we don’t have an equal playing field,” we don’t have to lose $5. 5 billion for the privilege of trading with China. Trump says “he is totally open to a tariff” if China doesn’t treat us fairly. He says he is a free trader but this is “not fair trade. ” Candidates are asked whether America should push the pause button on Muslim immigration: Kasich says he is for a pause on Syrian refugees but “we don’t want to put everybody in the same category. ” Christie says we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind because we cannot guarantee proper vetting. But he says that “you can’t just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic Jihadists. ” Rubio says that Obama has underestimated the threat of radical Islam. “If we do not know who you are and we do not know why you are coming, when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America. Another   from professional politician Rubio. Cruz says we need a    who is focused on keeping this country safe. He says we pass legislation that strips citizenship from Americans who go and fight with ISIS. The Senator doesn’t really answer the question and sounds like a Senator, but ends by saying “we will not let in refugees controlled by ISIS and  ” (more   to say this first). Carson says there needs to be new guidelines for  . Bush says we should destroy ISIS by creating   zones and   for the refugees. Jeb to Trump: I Hope You Reconsider Temporary Muslim Ban, 10:16: Trump is asked about his temporary Muslim ban. Bartiromo asks if there is anything he has heard that makes him want to rethink his position. Trump, who always answers the question, simple and directly says, “no. ” “We have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country that is not going to have the problems we’ve had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers  …     with the shootings in California. ” Trump mentions that he said “temporarily” and not “permanently. ” Trump says some of his Muslim friends have thanked him for highlighting the problem in Islam. “We have a serious problem. We can’t be the stupid country anymore,” Trump says. Bush asks Trump to reconsider because it makes it impossible to build the coalition to take out ISIS. “I hope you’ll reconsider,” Jeb says. “All Muslims. Seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security. ” Jeb again says Trump’s comments “are unhinged. ” Cavuto asks whether all the people who agree with Trump are “unhinged,” and Jeb responds, “absolutely not. ” When Cavuto points out that Trump’s poll numbers went up after his temporary Muslim ban, Trump responds, “11 points in South Carolina. ” The man knows his polls. Trump says he’s tired of seeing what’s going on at the border and “I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with  …     radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. ” Trump says he wants to find out why the two horrible people in San Bernardino murdered the innocent people who threw them a baby shower and why their neighbors didn’t call the police. He says the police are the “most mistreated people” in this country. “There’s something going on and it’s bad, and I’m saying we have to get to the bottom of it. ” 10:14: Carson says the Obama administration does not recognize how serious ISIS’s threat is. He says America needs to take away ISIS’s caliphate and we should give military officials what they need to destroy ISIS. Carson says that in addition to that, we take ISIS’s oil because it is their source of revenue (echoing Trump). Carson says we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their    centers. Christie says there will be no peace so long as Assad is in charge in Syria. Christie says America must enlist the Arab countries who believe ISIS is a threat and bring them together. He slams Hillary Clinton and warns against the dangers of giving Clinton, who enabled ISIS’s rise, four years in the White House. He says we have fewer democracies in the world since Obama took office. 10:02: Cruz is asked to explain his “New York values” dig at Trump. He says that “most people know exactly what New York values are. ” Bartiromo says she is from New York. And Cruz says since she is from New York, she may not but people in South Carolina do. He says the values in New York city are “socially liberal,     rights, focused around money and the media. ” He says the concept of New York values is not too hard to figure out. And Cruz says Trump explained some of his more liberal positions in the past because he is from New York. Cruz says that “not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I’m just saying. ” Trump says that conservatives do come out of Manhattan like William F. Buckley. He then says that when   occurred in New York, I saw something that no place on earth could have  handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. ” He saw the “most horrific cleanup” and the people of New York fought and fought. We saw more death  …    ” Trump says that the smell of death was in the air and the city built itself back up. “I have to tell you. That was a very insulting statement that Ted made,” Trump says. Regardless of Trump’s great answer on the question, painting Trump as a “northerner” will work in the South. But it will be neutralized to some extent because there are folks that are still uncomfortable with the fact that Cruz was born in Canada. Trump could have, in a friendly way, talked about Cruz’s Canadian citizenship and made a joke about it. 9:54: Trump is asked if there are any circumstances under wish we should be limiting gun sales. “No,” he says. “I am a   person. ” Trump says if the San Bernardino victims had guns, many would not have died. He agrees with Jeb about the country’s mental health problem. And he says that “guns don’t pull the trigger. People pull the trigger. ” Trump says Obama doesn’t want to bring people together and his executive orders are proof of that, Rubio says that gun sales have increased under Obama because people are afraid Obama will take away their guns. He says the Second Amendment is “not an option, but a Constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. ” Rubio says that he is convinced that Obama would confiscate all guns and get rid of the Second Amendment if he could. Cruz says you prosecute criminals and target bad guys to reduce gun violence. He points out that Attorney General Eric Holder said his mission was to brainwash the American people against guns. Cruz says Obama also launched Fast and Furious. He also says that Hillary Clinton agrees with the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case who believe that the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever. Cruz says if their view prevails, the Supreme Court will rule that not a single person has a right to bear arms and they will confiscate your guns. Cruz says that unless you are clinically insane, every Republican will say they support the Second Amendment in a GOP primary. Cruz points out he has a record of defending the Second Amendment and points out that he led the opposition against Obama’s   legislation and the other individuals on the stage were “nowhere to be found on that fight. ” 9:52: Jeb is asked about gun rights. Bush wants to recognize Haley for what she did after the Charleston shootings and the “people in that Church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed. ” Bush says that in Dylan Roof’s case, the FBI made a mistake and didn’t fulfill their part of the bargain on background checks. He says we don’t need to add new rules, we just need to enforce the laws on the books. He says the first impulse of   is they want to rights away from   citizens. 9:46: Carson is asked what he thinks about allegations that Hillary Clinton has been an enabler of Bill Clinton’s sexual misconduct. Carson says that there is no question that “we should be able to look at any past president  …     in terms of their past behavior and what it means. ” Carson says the real issue is whether America still has standards, values, and principles. He speaks about all the divisiveness and hatred that is going on in society and says that our strength is in our unity. He asks where the nastiness came from  …     and says it it “did not come from our   roots. ” Carson says Americans must recognize that there “is a right and wrong” and progressives should not be able to take that out of the culture. 9:43: Kasich is asked what is says about America when a   socialist like Sanders is catching fire. Kasich says that Republicans will win every state if Sanders is the nominee. He says that wages haven’t risen because the Fed has kept interest rates low and workers have not been given the skills they need. He says workers are upset when they get fired when they are 50 and they do not know where to go. He says we have to do a lot about the high cost of higher education and train people for good jobs that pay. He says people are very concerned about their economic future and we have to make sure that every America has the tools and people can think the American dream still exists. 9:40: Rubio, when asked about sliming Christie, says Obama is undermining the constitutional basis of the United States and says we cannot have a president who supports Common Core and gun control. Rubio mentions that Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood and “our next president has to be someone that   the damage Barack Obama has done to our country. It cannot be someone that agrees with his agenda. Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary  …     If we don’t get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. ” Christie denies that he wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. He says that he is not for more gun control and Common Core has been eliminated in his state. He says since Rubio is a Senator, he can just keep talking without any accountability. Christie says that two years ago, Rubio called Christie a “conservative reformer that New Jersey needed” and now Rubio has changed his tune. They are both really going after the New Hampshire vote. Bush talks about a conservative agenda that “doesn’t disparage people” because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton. Carson says he was mentioned because Bush said “everybody. ” Carson says that in 2012, Republicans tore themselves apart and “we have to stop this. If we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this  nation is over as we know it. We gotta look at the big picture here. ” 9: 38: Trump is asked about Haley’s State of the Union address and her comment about resisting “the siren call of the angriest voices. ” Trump says that he is friends with Haley. He says that yes he is indeed “very angry because our country is being run horribly. ” “I will gladly accept the mantle of anger,” Trump says. (worth nothing that a University of Michigan study found that anger indeed drives people to vote. And Trump is trying to get many   voters and those who have not participated in elections to vote for him). He says our military is a disaster, our healthcare is a “horror show,” we have no borders, “our vets are being treated horribly,” “illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry. And I won’t be angry when we fix it. And until we fix it, I am very very angry. ” Trump says Haley spoke the truth and didn’t find it offensive because he’s “angry because our country is a mess. ” 9:28: Cavuto says that Cruz is strict Constitutionalist. He asks the “  citizen” question. Cavuto notes that Trump and others have said that Cruz is not a “  citizen. ” Here’s the full exchange here, courtesy of Joel. Cruz says, “I’m glad we’re focusing on the important topics of the evening. ” He says that back in September, Trump said his lawyers said there was “nothing to this birther issue. ” He says “since September, the Constitution hasn’t changed. But the poll numbers have. I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really clear. The child of a U. S. citizen born abroad is a   citizen. ” A great answer from Cruz. Much better than his explanation about his $1 million loan. Cruz says some of the more extreme birthers say that a “  citizen” must have two parents born on U. S. soil. He says under that theory, Cruz, Rubio, Bobby Jindal and, “interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified because Donald’s mother was born in Scotland. She was born here. ” “On the issue of citizenship, Donald, I’m not going to use your mother’s birth against you,” Cruz says. Trump answers, “because it wouldn’t work. ” Trump says that   Street Journal just came out with a poll headlined “Trump way up, Cruz going down. ” After the crowd boos, Trump says “they don’t like the Wall Street Journal, NBC, but I like the poll. ” Trump says he is beating Cruz in the last three Iowa polls and accuses Cruz of misrepresenting his poll numbers. Trump says he thinks he is going to win fair and square. He says Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe, who was one of Obama’s earliest backers, has questioned whether Cruz is qualified to be president. Trump says the problem is that if Trump chooses Cruz as his vice presidential candidate, the Democrats sue because “we can’t take him along for the ride. I don’t like that. The fact is  …     and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field (when the crowd boos, Trump quips they don’t like that he beats the rest of the field because they want me) I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you’re running. ” “If you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can be serving in office. So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment. Let the courts decide,” Trump says. He says he’s raising the issue now because he’s “been doing a little bit better. ” He says now Cruz has a  % chance. Say what you want about Trump, but he is refreshingly honest about his tactics and doesn’t talk like the traditional politician. Trump says that he has been defending the Constitution his entire life before the Supreme Court, “and I’m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump. ” Trump says he doesn’t have to. “Take it from your own professor,” Trump says. Cruz says the chances of any litigation succeeding and proceeding on this is zero. Cruz adds that Tribe was Al Gore’s lawyer and a major Hillary supporter. Cruz says Clinton’s supporters are attacking Cruz because they want Trump as the GOP nominee. And Trump says he is happy to consider Trump as his VP so if Trump is right, “he can get the top job at the end of the day. ” Trump says he would go back to “building buildings if it doesn’t work out,” but he has a feeling that it will work out. Rubio apologizes for interrupting “Court TV” and says this election has to be about reversing all the damage Obama has inflicted on the country. 9:22: Cruz is asked about allegations that he did not disclose a $1 million loan from Goldman Sachs. Cruz tells Bartiromo, “Well, Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece on the front page of the New  York Times. ” He rails against the New York Times and the mainstream media that have been out to get him. “The New York Times and I don’t have the warmest of relationships,” he says. Cruz says that unlike Clinton, he doesn’t have hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank. He says his opponent David Dewhurst in the Senate put in $25 million and Cruz had to put in money to defend himself against the attack ads and fund the campaign. Cruz says he and his wife took a loan against their assets to defend themselves against the attack ads and says he made a “paperwork error. ” “If that’s the best hit the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well,” he says. Cruz needed a more succinct explanation. His answer was too much in the weeds. He sounds like a Senator. And when you are explaining like a Senator, you are losing to viewers. 9:20: Trump is asked about Syrian refugees. “It’s not fear and terror. It’s reality,” Trump says of the threat of terrorism. He says you have to look at Indonesia, San Bernardino, Paris. Trump says the Syrian doctor  who Obama said is the “real face of the refugees” is not representative. Trump says the refugees can be “the great Trojan horse. ” He said when he looked at the migration line, there were very few women and children and there were “strong, powerful men. Young. ” He says “people are looking at that and saying, ‘what’s going on. ’” Trump says we are $19 trillion in debt and we can’t let all these refugees come in and break our borders. “We just can’t do it,” he says. Breitbart    Joel Pollak on Cruz: Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) fielded the first question of the GOP Debate in Charleston, South Carolina. When he was asked a question about jobs, he took the opportunity to preface his answer by slamming President Barack Obama for ignoring the plight of ten U. S. Navy sailors who had been seized by Iran on Tuesday. Moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Cruz to respond to President Barack Obama’s contention in the State of the Union address that those talking about an economic decline in America were “peddling fiction. ” Cruz answered: Let me start —  I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs. But I want to start with something. Today many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of ten American sailors on their knees with their hands on their heads. In that State of the Union, President Obama didn’t so much as mention the ten sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obama’s preparing to send 100 billion dollars or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I tell you, it was heartbreaking. But the good news is: The next    is standing on this stage. APPLAUSE, And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no serviceman or servicewoman will be forced to be on their knees in any nation that captures our fighting men and women. We’ll field the full force and fury of the United States of America. APPLAUSE, The sailors were freed Wednesday, after being paraded on Iranian television. Cruz went to talk about “the   economy” that “has left behind the working men and women” of America while enriching a circle of cronies in Washington, D. C. 9:18: Next up is Carson. He is asked how America attacks a network that does not accept national borders. Carson says he is glad to get a question this early on. He says that Obama doesn’t realize that we live in the 21st century and war is different from how it was before. He says we have dirty bombs, cyber attacks, and people who will be attacking our electrical grid. 9:15: Cavuto asks Rubio how he would define the terror threat. Rubio, like everyone else, doesn’t answer the initial question and says Hillary is “disqualified to be president of the United States. ” He says someone who mishandles intelligence information and lies to the families of the Benghazi victims “can never be president of the United States. ” Rubio says that Obama thinks America is an “arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. ” He says that is why we have a foreign policy in which America cuts deals with Iran, betrays Israel, and apologizes for America. Rubio says there is a war against radical jihadists and either they win or we win. Rubio says if America captures any ISIS member alive, they are getting a “  ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ” 9:12: Next question for Jeb. Still nothing for Trump. Bush says that the idea that we are somehow better off today than when Obama was elected is “totally an alternative universe. ” He says the “world has been torn asunder. ” He says Obama talks about red lines with “grandiose language” but does nothing to follow it up. Bush says Obama is missing the point that America leadership is required to have peace and stability in the world and speaks about “peace through strength” and how the Obama administration has gutted the nation’s military. He says our enemies don’t fear us and our friends no longer think we have their backs. Bush says if Clinton gets elected, Hillary may be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. 9:09: Christie is asked where and when a president should use military action to restore order. Still no question for Trump. Christie says on Tuesday night he watched “story time” with Barack Obama and it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing. Christie says we have to strengthen our alliances around the world and our allies need to be able to count on our word. He says the one thing that has never been said about him is that he is misunderstood. He says the adversaries have to understand the limits of our patience. Christie says it was “absolutely disgraceful” that the Iran situation showed our relations were getting better and tried to spin the ten American soldiers who were forced to their knees as something positive. Christie, when pressed on the original question, says he will use military action if it is absolutely necessary to protect American lives and interests around the world. He says, though, that America is not the world’s police force. 9:07: Kasich says commonsense regulations, tax cuts, and balanced budgets grow the economy. He touts the balanced budget that he help orchestrate when he was in Congress. 9:05: The first question on the economy goes to Cruz. He sidesteps the question and says Americans were horrified to see the ten American sailors on their knees. He says Obama is preparing to send hundreds of billions of Iran and did not mention the sailors in his State of the Union address. He says if he is elected president, Americans will not be on their knees and any nation that captures our men and women will face the full force of the United States of America, On the question, he says Obama tried to paint a rosy situation because Washington lobbyists are doing great under Obama but the workforce participation rate is dismal. He says the Obama administration has left behind the working men and women of this country. 9:oo PM: The seven candidates now take the stage. 8:55 PM: The main event is about to begin and Republican National Committee Chair says the party will support whomever the nominee is. 7:00: Santorum says America is frustrated and angry and looking for someone who is a fighter and a winner. He says there is one person in the race that has taken on Hillary Clinton on   abortion. He says he is going to take some of Rand Paul’s time and says he has fought Clinton on Iran sanctions. He says he ran against the Clinton machine in 1994 and won against the   machine. Huckabee says he also fought the Clinton machine. He says he spent the first half of his adult life raising a family and understanding how tough it is for people to make it. He says he understood then that America needed politicians who haven’t spent their whole lives running for office. He says there needs to be leadership that addresses the moral issues of our country. He asks politicians say “God Bless America” at the end of every political speech and asks, “how can we do that when we continue to slaughter 4, 000 babies a day. ” He wants to be a president who protects the unborn under the   Amendments. Fiorina says her husband Frank was excited the other day because he was introduced as her “eye candy. ” She says Americans would pay to see a debate between her and Hillary Clinton. Fiorina says she has been told all her life to sit down and be quiet, settle, and don’t challenge the system. She says Americans are being told to sit down and be quite about our God, about our guns, about the abortion industry. Settle for illegal immigration that has been a problem for decades  …    accept a system of government and politics that no longer works for us. I will not sit down and be quiet. And neither will you. So, I ask you to stand with me, fight with me, vote for me. ” Give Fiorina credit on this. She often has the best closing statements, and changes them and keeps them fresh up unlike Rubio who says the same thing every time. But there’s something about her that is a little too mechanical. Replace Hillary Clinton with Fiorina in Obama’s “Vote Different” ad that was a remake of the famous 1984 Apple ad and it would work just as well. 6:57: Santorum talks up Robert Putnam’s Our Kids (it’s a great book). He says the liberal sociologist sought to write about the hollowing out of the middle class and discovered, after studying all of the information, that the biggest reason we are seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family. This is one of Santorum’s strongest areas. And he says “we’ve been too politically correct in this country because we don’t want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. ” Santorum says Obama should use his bully pulpit to ask America to rebuild the American family, because that will change the economy. Extremely strong   from Santorum. That message on rebuilding the American family is something that resonates across    lines. 6:54: Huckabee is asked about automation and how it threatens workers’ ability to get higher wages. He says the reason so many people have a tough time getting ahead is that the tax system punishes Americans as they move up the economic ladder. He again uses his time to speak up the Fair Tax. 6:50: Fiorina is asked about the widening income gap and restoring the Middle Class that is no longer the majority. She says that when government gets bigger, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the Middle Class gets squeezed. Fiorina talks bout reforming the tax code, focusing on every single dollar the government spends. 6:43: Huckabee is asked how the country can pay down its debt without cutting Social  . He says Social Security is not the government’s money. “It belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives. For the government to say well, it’s the fault of the working people that we have a social security problem. No, it’s the fault of the government that used those people’s money for something other than protecting those people’s accounts. Let’s not blame them and punish them. ” Huckabee says working until 70 is great for   people with a desk jobs but it’s a different story for laborers. Huckabee then speaks about the Fair Tax that will “super charge” the economy. 6:40: Santorum: ‘We Need to Be the Party that Stands for the American Worker’ Santorum says America’s numbers don’t add up re: adding manufacturing jobs. He says Obama has done more to take jobs away from   people who are struggling the most. Santorum says the 74% of Americans who don’t have a college degree will end up paying for Obama’s free community college program. He says nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in America today. Santorum then turns to immigration. He says wages are flattening because nearly all illegal immigrants and most legal immigrants are working in   jobs. He says it is unfortunate that most of the candidates in the field and both political parties favor amnesty and allowing illegal immigrants to stay here while increasing levels of legal immigration. “We need to be the party that stands for the American worker,” he says. 6:38: Santorum is asked about how vulnerable America’s infrastructure is to terrorism. Santorum warns against electromagnetic pulse attacks and he says the best way to prevent that from happening is to make sure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon so they can’t explode a device over out atmosphere. He says Obama has put Iran on a path toward a nuclear weapon while America has done nothing to harden our electric grid so American can survive an EMP attack. 6:35: Huckabee: Obama More Interested in ‘Protecting the Reputation and Image of Islam than He Is in Protecting Us. ” Huckabee says it’s time to look at America’s   program. He points out that the European Union is a failure and is making Europe less safe. He says our first and foremost responsibility is to protect America and Americans and he says Obama who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is in protecting us. ” He says Obama needs to read his own FBI crime stats that say that 58% of religious hate crimes have been directed toward Jews last year while 16% were directed towards Muslims. He says maybe Obama should have spoken out against the the rise of   comments. Huckabee says a   commerce that makes America more safe is worth it re: stopping the   program. He blasts Obama for promising Americans they can keep their doctors and insurance plans. He says the latest is “if you like your gun, you can keep it, too. And frankly, we don’t buy it. We don’t believe it. He’s lost his credibility. ” 6:31: Huckabee is asked if there is anything that can be done at the federal level to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals. He says the government should never do anything “idiotic” like “Fast and Furious” where the U. S. government put guns in the hands of Mexican drug lords that resulted in the death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Huckabee says there is no “  loophole” and he blasts Obama for saying it is “easier to get guns than groceries. ” He says it is much more difficult to purchase firearms than to get ingredients for a salad at the grocery store. Huckabee says Obama keeps retrying things that don’t work on gun violence and says that one common thing re: the mass shootings is that they happened in   zones. And people who could have stood up and tried to stop the attacks were not allowed to under the law. 6:28: Fiorina is asked about Obama’s executive orders on gun control. She blasts Obama’s “lawless executive order” and says Obama is again trying to unilaterally override what he could not get passed in Congress. “Sorry, Mr. President. Not the way the Constitution works,” she says. Fiorina says we need to enforce the laws we have. She then takes the technology question that Santorum was asked. She says bureaucracies do not know how to innovate and there are specific things the private sector should be asked to do to help the government since it has the capabilities the government does not have. She also says America must have a president who understands technology. “Mrs. Clinton, you cannot wipe a server with a towel,” she says. 6:25: Santorum says a lot of technologists are very skilled but they are not “war fighters. ” He says America need more leadership on how to go on the offensive against our enemies online. He says America’s enemies who launch cyberattacks are not punished. He says it is dicey for government to force companies like   to do the job that the U. S. government should be doing. It’s interesting that so much of the “economic debate” has centered around foreign policy. If the questions focus more on the economy, I wonder if any of the candidates will mention the late, great Roger Milliken, who always put American workers first, especially since the debate is taking place in South Carolina. 6:18: Fiorina is asked about the savages who raped   German women on New Year’s Eve. Many of the perpetrators were asylum seekers, and she says “we cannot allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them, and we know we can’t therefore, we should stop allowing refugees in this country. ” Differentiating herself from Nikki Haley, Fiorina also says we do not need to be lectured about why we are   because we’ve had an illegal immigration problem for the last 25 years. She says Americans also have a right to be angry at politicians who promise change and never fulfill them. 6:13: Huckabee says radical Islam is a threat to “every civilized person on this earth. ” He says we need to be equipping the Kurds and never spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal. He speaks about rebuilding our Navy and strengthening the military to win wars. When Huckabee is asked whether America needs to be in Afghanistan, he says only if there is a concerted effort to destroy radical Islamists who are intent on destroying America. He says the role of the U. S. military is not to build schools but to kill our enemies and make Americans safe. 6:10: Santorum is asked about Saudi   relations. Santorum says the Iran Deal needs to be torn up on the first day of the new presidency. He says that Iran has already torn up the agreement and has already violated the terms of the agreement by launching ballistic missiles. He says it is “pathetic” that Obama backed down on Iran sanctions. Santorum asks the Citadel cadets to stand and says he wants to tell each one of them if you choose to serve this country, “I will have your back. I will not let America be trampled upon anymore by these radical Jihadists. ” 6:08: Fiorina says America has refused to respond to Iran’s provocations and those of North Korea. She says we’ll get more provocation and bad behavior if America continues to ignore bad behavior from its adversaries. 6:02 PM EST: Candidates are asked about their assessment of the economy. Fiorina says she is honored to be standing with two former Iowa caucus winners. Fiorina says, unlike another woman in the race, “I actually do love spending time with my husband. ” Huckabee says President Barack Obama should have stood in line at the layaway counter and with those who clean his campaign headquarters in Arkansas to find out that there are a lot of people hurting in his economy. Santorum says Obama needs to listen to the Democratic debate to find out how bad the economy is doing. He says Democrats have been in control for the last seven years and the jobs that “fill the middle” have been lost under  . No matter how hard Fiorina tries to frame herself as the “outsider” politician who will shake up the system, voters just aren’t buying it. They get the sense that she has “establishment” ”politician” written all over her. Her ridiculous Rose Bowl Tweet rooting against her alma mater in favor of Iowa, a football team she may have never even followed, just reinforced the suspicious voters have about her. 5:59 PM EST: Huckabee, Fiorina, and Santorum take the stage. Paul is absent, and he may regret it as he would have finally had the time to articulate his   views on government surveillance and foreign policy and how they differ from those of his opponents. Paul missed a chance weeks before voters start going to the polls to get some crucial soundbites.</td>\n",

The main topic at the     confab? How to stop Republican   Donald Trump.

Clinton says “an ally, for sure. ” She says they have differences and are passionate about their positions and differences. She says to compare that the Republicans and “how they behave. ” She says she is proud of their campaigns and she hopes to work with Sanders if she wins the nomination because Sanders’s supporters will be important in the general election and beyond. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” Clinton says when asked about whether Sanders will be her VP pick. [Clinton, for the most part, ran out the clock on Fox News. Fox News gleefully asked Trump about his comments about women. For some reason, Fox News never brought up whether Bill Clinton’s past affairs will haunt her during the campaign. The network did not ask her if it is hypocritical to play the “war on women” card. Fox News did not ask her if she stopped playing the “sexism” card on Trump after Trump accused her of enabling her husband’s shenanigans and intimidating women who came forward. The network did not ask her why so many alleged sexual assault victims from her husband’s past are now speaking against him. Just like Mitt Romney, Fox News was tougher on Trump than on Democrats. The network, at the very least, could have brought up the “war on women”  issues even while giving those issues the   treatment.] 6:56: Baier asks Clinton why young   are not supporting her. She says it is good that Democrats are bringing more people into the process and she again repeats her line that she will be for them even if they are not for her. [Same answer she has given at nearly every  .] 6:50: Questioner asks why Clinton supported the ’90s Crime Bill and whether she would support the same bill if it were on the table today. She says Sanders voted for it while she just “supported it. ” She says there were some positive things in the crime bill the combat the crime epidemic. But she says that there were problems that were solved but there were also “mistakes made. ” She says the bill set off a chain reaction where more and more people got incarcerated when they should not have been. She says we have to replace the “  ” pipeline with a “  ” pipeline. She calls on Michigan’s governor to return control of the Detroit schools back to Detroit. She touts her   tuition plan to make college more affordable. She differentiates her plan from Sanders’s. Clinton says “her numbers add up” when asked about reducing the country’s debt and implies that Sanders’s numbers don’t. 6:49: Baier asks Clinton who were favorite Republican is. Same question CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked. She gives the same answer.   Susan Collins and John McCain. She says she will hesitate to name name because it will hurt them. 6:46: Questioner wonders how Clinton will get anything done in Washington when “compromise is a bad word. ” Clinton says that when she was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, she worked with some of the most partisan Republicans. She talks up her role in the passage of CHIP and foster care issues. Clinton says Republicans say really nice things about her when she is not running and she has a ton of archival material [Republicans may regret praising Clinton in order to attack Obama in 2008]. She says “compromise is not a dirty word” and it is the way “democracy has to work. ” 6:41: Baier asks Clinton about her email scandal. He says Democrats are worried that another shoe will drop. Clinton says it was a “mistake” to use a personal server. She says a lot of government officials have done the same (they have not used private servers though some may have used private email accounts). Speaking in legalese, Clinton says she nothing she sent or received was “MARKED CLASSIFIED. ” Baier asks Clinton whether she lied when she said there was no classified material on her servers after the State Department found 22   emails. Clinton says the State Department decides what is and isn’t classified. She says she will reiterate that nothing she sent or received was “marked classified. ” She doesn’t say just “classified” anymore like she did at the March press conference. Clinton says the some of the classified emails that were found were “not classified at the time. ” She says after FOIA requests, government agents can later decide to classify various emails because they do not want to release. Clinton’s explaining and she’s losing on this answer. 6:37: Baier asks Clinton about abortion  …     She says that Roe v. Wade is “rooted” in the Constitution and women have this “right” to make this “highly personal decision with their family, in accordance with their faith, with their doctor. ” She says it is not much of a “right” if it is “totally limited and constrained. ” She says we have to continue to stand up for a woman’s right to “make these decisions” and “defend Planned Parenthood. ” Her supporters in the audience cheer. Clinton rejects banning abortions after 20 weeks. [  thing   are fundamental rights  …    ] 6:34: Baier asks Clinton about Libya and points out that it is in total chaos after Clinton’s “smart power” (borrowed from Joseph Nye) foreign policy strategy there. She says Qaddafi was a ruthless dictator whom Reagan tried to once take out. Clinton, after repeating talking points, says what has happened is “deeply regrettable. ” She says it is fair to say that if there hadn’t been the intervention, we would be looking at something resembling Syria. When Baier asks whether Clinton would put U. S. troops on the ground in Libya, Clinton says not “combat troops. ” She says there is a concerted effort to unify the different elements in Libya and concedes Libya has not been as successful as Tunisia. 6:33: Hillary on Fox News. Baier asks Clinton about Bloomberg’s decision not to run. She says she has the greatest respect for Bloomberg, who conveniently slammed Trump and Cruz in his announcement. 6:29: When asked if Sanders will accept a VP nomination, he says he is running to be President of the United States. 6:28: Questioner asks Sanders what his plan is to rebuild the country’s infrastructure. Sanders says “we should not be having a Flint, Michigan” water crisis in the wealthiest country in the world. He says we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. He talks about bridges, water systems, etc. Sanders says he has proposed spending $1 trillion over five years to make sure   have the resources they need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Sanders says $1 trillion sounds like a lot of money but civil engineers say even more needs to be spent. He says his plan will create $13 million jobs. 6:27: Sanders says he will not reveal his favorite Republican because it will be a disservice to that person. 6:23: Sanders says he will not rely on executive action to push his   agenda. He pivots and says there are too many lawmakers worried about securing donations from wealth people. He says that is why Congress is not listening to ordinary people and only listening to Wall Street, multinational corporations, and large campaign contributors. When Baier asks how he would convince a GOP Congress to enact  his agenda, Sanders says if he becomes president, it will have been because of a massive voter turnout  …    He says if that happens, the Republicans will not continue to control the Senate “and have a lot less seats in the House. ” Sanders claims there is overwhelming support to raise the minimum wage and his voters will pressure lawmakers to raise it, etc  …    He will mobilize millions of voters who will also demand pay equity. 6:21: Baier asks if Sanders thinks abortion should be illegal at any stage of pregnancy. He says it is wrong for the government to tell  a woman what to do with her own body. Sanders also says he respects opposing viewpoints. Sanders says he is “very strongly  ” when asked whether abortions should be banned after five months except for the health of the mother. He says that decision is between the woman, her doctor, and her family. 6:17: Questioner asks Sanders to explain his healthcare system. He again insists that it is a “right for all people. ” Questioner has concerns about replacing the current system with “Medicare for all. ” Sanders says that is what Clinton is trying to scare people about and says he will not leave anyone behind as president. Sanders says we have made good progress but we still have millions who are underinsured. He says many Americans are sicker because they didn’t go to the doctor before because of high deductibles or could not afford prescription drugs that doctors prescribed. 6:14: Questioner says he will speak for the American public and say Sanders is much more honest than Sanders. He’s also a Trump supporter. He asks Sanders whether taxing the rich will hurt job creators. Sanders says we have to put in context what has happened in the last 30 years. He says there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the working class to the top 1%. Sanders blasts America’s unfair trade deals. He says corporations will invest in America and not in China. He says he does not believe in   economics. Sanders says he believes that more money needs to be put in the hands of working families by raising the minimum wage to a living wage. He talks about the country’s poor infrastructure and asks why the infrastructure is collapsing in the wealthiest country in the world. He blasts corporations for stashing their profits offshore and not paying a nickel in taxes. 6:13: First questioner asks Sanders about ISIS. Sanders says ISIS is a “barbaric organization that has to be destroyed. ” He says that one of the differences between Clinton and himself is he voted against the Iraq War while Clinton voted for it. He says  a lot of the   resulted from that “disastrous decision. ” Sanders says the United States needs to work with its allies in the Middle East to combat ISIS. He says what is happening to Christians and Muslims is “horrific” when asked about Christian prosecution. 6:10: When Baier asks Sanders if he shares the concern of his supporters that Clinton is not “honest and trustworthy. ” Sanders says he will let Americans decide that. He says he is proud he received 86% of the vote in Vermont. 6:06: Sanders explains that he wanted the 1% to bail out Wall Street and not the taxpayers at a Fox News town hall event. Baier presses Sanders how he would prevent a debt crisis with his spending plans. Sanders says by guaranteeing health care to all people, the average   family would save about $  on healthcare costs. He says healthcare is a “right of all people. ” When asked where the right came from, Sanders says, “being a human being. ” Sanders says the poor (if she is poor and you are rich) are entitled to the same healthcare as the rich because “she is a human being. ” Sanders is scrambling on how he would bring down the debt. Now reverting to talking points about free public college for all  …     He now says he will pay for his programs by taxing Wall Street speculation. “It’s Wall Street’s turn to help the middle class of this country,” he says. 6:05: Trump suggests immigration pause. He says   minorities will benefit the most (FLASHBACK: Slate’s Jamelle Bouie: ‘Not a Bad Play’ for Trump to Court Black Voters with  . S. Worker Immigration Plan): “Record rates of immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for U. S. workers. Pew polling shows 83 percent of all voters  —   Democrats, Republicans and Independents  —   think immigration should be frozen or reduced. The biggest beneficiaries of allowing fewer foreign workers into our country would be minority workers, including all immigrants now living here, who are competing for jobs, benefits and community resources against record waves of foreign workers. Limiting job competition would reopen pathways to   stability and shrink welfare rolls. In addition, it would relieve overcrowding in our schools and hospitals that afflict our poorest communities. Yet, Senators Cruz and Rubio have led the charge for even higher immigration rates  —   a policy supported by only 7 percent of the Republican electorate. When I am President we will listen to the people  —   not the special interests  —   and get immigration numbers under control, as the voters have demanded. ” 6:00: Trump loves Idaho’s potatoes: Thank you Idaho!

Trump has laid bare the ridiculousness of the conservative label. In 2016, the word conservative can be seen as a tool of influence  —   a shaming tool  —   used by the party elites to bring people together under their handpicked puppet. Conservativedoesn’t have a normal definition that is useful and widely understood. That’s why it works so well for persuasion. If it had a rigid definition, lots of people could find a reason to disagree. But by leaving the definition of conservative in ambiguity, people see nothing with which they can disagree. That is classic persuasion. 11:04  —   Compared to previous winners, Rubio   in Puerto Rico, Final Puerto Rico vote: Rubio 71%.

One note of caution here: Polls in Louisiana and Kentucky showed a similar lead for Trump. The end result, though, was a Trump win but only by a squeaker.</td>\n",

He’s a Hummer doing 90. weaving in and out of traffic. He is dominating all elements of the GOP demographic coalition not just those who are angry’: Donald Trump’s victory in the South Carolina primary demonstrated his strength among Republican voters of all stripes and even helped force Jeb Bush, once considered the likely frontrunner in the GOP presidential contest, to suspend his campaign —  a sign of how the real estate mogul has upended politics. Despite his   with Pope Francis, the state’s governor endorsing his rival and the appearance in the state of George W. Bush to help his brother, Trump won big in South Carolina. According to exit polls, he carried veterans and older voters, virtually tied Ted Cruz for the evangelical vote and dominated among voters with no college, some college and college degrees. He won moderates and conservatives. His only weaknesses were among   “very conservative” voters, the more affluent and voters with graduate degrees. None of this means that Trump is unstoppable. But he’s also won secular New Hampshire, where less than a quarter of the state’s Republican primary voters were evangelical. (In South Carolina, it’s 69 percent.) He came in second in the Iowa Caucuses. The southern states that dominate the March 1 and March 15 primary dates also seem like very fertile ground for the real estate mogul. “Let’s put this thing away,” said a very competant Trump as he declared victory and looked forward to the upcoming contests. [  …    ] It’s become cliche in the presidential campaign to talk about candidates having different lanes —  an outsider lane, an establishmient lane, etc. But Trump has no lane. He’s a Hummer doing 90. weaving in and out of traffic. He is dominating all elements of the GOP demographic coalition not just those who are angry. At this point here is no certainty, as Washington insisders had once hoped, that as the field narrowed Trump would be stopped either because voters somehow came to their senses or because the party would coalesce around a less controversial alternative. But that seems less likely. The thinning field has actually strengthened Trump and while it’s possible that in a    race Cruz or Rubio could beat Trump but so far, with the exception of one outlier poll, the evidence suggests that Trump could beat them. 10:15: Kasich thinks it’s a   race: Kasich: once there were 8 governors running for President and now there is only one.  —   Heather Haddon (@heatherhaddon) February 21, 2016,  10:12: Eric Cantor, ladies and gentlemen: Proud to be a @JebBush supporter  …     he’s a great American.  —   Eric Cantor (@EricCantor) February 21, 2016,  10:10: Record turnout in South Carolina: Now more than 711, 000 votes counted with 97% in.

He congratulates Messrs. Bush and Trump. He praises Jeb! as the “greatest governor in the history of Florida. ” Rubio says the “children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership. ” He says they are ready to do for the next generation “what Ronald Reagan did to us. ” Rubio talks about 21st century conservatism and and talks up Sen. Tim Scott’s story, Haley’s story, and his story. Rubio says conservatives will fight for single moms, fathers who work two jobs to give kids opportunities they never had, high school students who go to schools across towns to better their lots in life. “We will fight for you because we come from where you are now, we live the way you are living now,” Rubio says. He says the race “practically speaking” is down to three men and asks people to join his campaign because he gives the GOP the best chance to unite the party and the country. Rubio says he will always remember South Carolina as the place of “new beginnings” and “fresh start. ” [Rubio’s speech would have been a lot better had he won South Carolina like his advisers had predicted and with all of the major endorsements that he received. It seems like he is trying too hard to look like a “winner” and the speech seems like it would be better as a   act at the convention given that he hasn’t won a state yet.] 9:05: Trump: “let’s put this thing away. ” 9:02: We love our military and “We love our police. They’re not being treated properly. ” Trump says we are going to build our military so big, so powerful that “nobody is going to mess with us, folks. ” Trump says we’ll get the equipment that the general needs and not want lawmakers in Congress who are controlled by special interests tell them that they need. Trump says he is   his campaign. Trump says we’re going to take care of our vets. Crowd chants “USA! USA! USA!” after Trump says his supporters make up an “incredible movement. ” Trump says “Make America Great Again” is maybe the “greatest of all time. ” [Tony Lee: Trump is getting better with his   speeches but it has to be better, tighter. For what it’s worth, though, this is only Trump’s third   speech ever. So it is a work in progress.] 9:00: Coulter fired up: TRUMP: ”We’re going to do the wall.

He says his campaign is up against a powerful Super PAC that receives money from Wall Street and special interests before Super Tuesday. He asks for small donations to help him combat Clinton’s Super PAC. 6:38: Bernie Sanders is taking the stage in Nevada. He mentions that he was 25 points behind five weeks ago and made progress. Sanders says Clinton ran an “aggressive” and “effective” campaign and he applauds the Clinton campaign for its efforts. Sanders says his campaign is about bringing more people into he political process and again blasts the corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining democracy. He will not let billionaires and Super PACs by elections. He says the American people are catching on that we have a “rigged economy. ” He also slams the country’s broken criminal justice system. Wall Street executives whose illegal behavior destroys the economy do not get criminal records, Sanders says. His says “our job is to bring justice back to the criminal justice system. ” 6:30: Brian Williams does his best to downplay Clinton’s health concerns. He says Clinton has been trying to suppress a cough all week and her unusual coughing fit was the subject of certain websites last week. 6:22: Clinton now speaks about “systemic racism” and reforming criminal   systems. Clinton always sounds like she is lecturing when speechifying before large crowd, as if she doesn’t realize how she sounds when she tries to compete with crowd noise. Clinton says she knows what young people are up against and says it has to be about “what we’re going to build together” and not just what we give to you. Clinton says she will propose new ways for more Americans to get involved in national service. Appealing directly to minority voters: Clinton says imagine a tomorrow where “no child grows up in the shadow of discrimination and under the specter of deportation. ” [This was Clinton’s first “victory” speech without an asterisk and her husband seems just as —  if not more —  relieved than Clinton] 6:20: Taking a    shot at Sanders, Clinton says “we’re not a   country. ” 6:16: An exuberant Hillary Clinton thanks Nevada supporters. She says she is “so thrilled” and “grateful” to all of her supporters. “This one’s for you,” she says. She said her supporters turned out in every corner of the state. She said hotel and casino workers never wavered and “students with too much debt” and “small business owners who never go off the clock” all supported her. She says this is “your campaign” and it is a “campaign to break down every barrier that holds you back. ” “We hear you, we see you, we’re incredibly grateful to you,” Clinton says. Clinton says there is so much that is wrong in this country (but doesn’t mention much of what she is speaking about has occurred under Obama’s presidency). Clinton pivots to South Carolina and talks about “crumbling classrooms. ” She talks about Flint’s “poison water” that residents were forced to drink because the governor wanted to save money. She says Americans have a right to be angry and talks about wanting to get secret, unaccountable money out of politics (Clinton always says this with a straight face). She says Wall Street should not be able to threaten Main Street after saying that the next Supreme Court Justice shouldn’t let corporations buy elections. 6:15: She was for it before she was against TPP, though: Union support key to Clinton’s huge win in Nevada.

Gulbis says that when she earned her tour card 16 years ago, she was told there were only two things you shouldn’t talk about in public —  politics and faith. She says she is going to violate that rule today at the RNC as a Christian woman. Gulbis says she has always wanted to own a Boys and Girls Club and felt that she was treated unfairly as a woman. Trump helped her open up her own Boys and Girls Club. Trump, she says, encouraged her to be “fearless” and to think of herself as a businessperson instead of a female athlete. Gulbis, who defended Michelle Wie back in the day when people were piling on her, says Trump remains a consistent voice who reminds her to stand up to gender injustice and lean in to any challenge that comes her way.

He says the United States was founded on the Constitution and the most important power given to the President is to be   . He says the Constitution requires that the President swears to faithfully execute the office and preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He says Clinton took a similar oath when she became Secretary of State and violated it.   8:37: Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge says that Clinton is still “poor” in all the ways that count —  poor judgement, poor policies, and poor decisions. She says Clinton is a lawyer but she acts like the law doesn’t apply to her. She says, as her dad would say. “Hillary would lie even when the truth would server her better. ” 8:35: Arkansas Gov.

He says nobody took him seriously except for Trump. White says Trump encouraged him to build his business and saw UFC’s potential and got in the trenches.

She slams Clinton for hypocritically playing the gender card when as Senator she paid women less than men and then as Secretary of state lied to the mothers, wives, and daughters of those who died in combat. She slams her foundation for accepting donations from country’s that oppress women.

       "        <td>Welcome to the Breitbart News Livewire of President Donald Trump’s first address to a Joint Session of Congress. The president will address the nation at 9:00 pm eastern from the Hall of the House of Representatives, where he is expected to lay out a broad vision of his administration’s agenda. [Topics he’s expected to address include Obamacare, immigration, the border wall, his budget, military buildup, veteran affairs, national security, trade,   economy, education, and law enforcement. He’ll touch on the same themes that propelled him to the White House. Look for an emphasis on America First  —   with the phrase “buy American and hire American” as his administration’s policy lodestar.  Capitol Hill is looking for any indication of Trump’s preference on the various Obamacare replacement proposals. Politico, however, reports that Trump is unlikely to embrace any specific plan. Breitbart’s Sean Moran offers a primer on the various Obamacare replacement plans. Trump’s budget is also being hotly debated. Jonathan Swan at Axios reports that Trump is not expected to explicitly endorse Speaker Paul Ryan’s border adjustment tax tonight, which, Swan reports, Trump’s team is “divided on. The nationalist wing of the White House  —   led by Steve Bannon  —   supports the plan to raise $1 trillion by hiking taxes on imports. Officials closer to corporate America, including top economic advisor Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are said to be deeply skeptical. ” Ryan wants the border adjustment tax to offset any Trump tax cut proposal. Swan has updated his initial story to note the White House talking points about the address state: “We must have fair trade for our workers  —   foreign countries can no longer be allowed to tax our exports while shipping goods into our country for free. ” This language might suggest an openness to the border adjustment tax concept or simply signal a willingness to use tariffs. The budget debate is also expected to be contentious in the coming weeks with Sen. Lindsay Graham ( ) declaring the president’s budget “dead on arrival” because of Trump’s proposed cuts to the State Department. Meanwhile, there are also reports that Trump might be open to “an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides. ” As Breitbart’s Neil Munro points out, take these reports with a grain of salt until further details of such a deal are hashed out. We can also expect the usual D. C. partisan drama tonight. Some Democrat lawmakers are boycotting the address, including Rep. Maxine Waters ( ). Others are bringing illegal immigrants with them as their guests. First Lady Melania Trump’s guests, on the other hand, reportedly include Jessica Davis, Susan Oliver, and Jamiel Shaw, Sr.  —   each of whom lost loved ones to illegal immigrant criminals. Stay with us throughout the evening as we offer live updates. All times eastern. Watch the speech live on Breitbart’s Facebook here. *** 12:09 am  —   Watching the cable news replay of the speech one is struck again by the impolite manner in which Democrat lawmakers refused to even clap as a show of acknowledgment or greeting to the president at the beginning of his address. Republicans were never this impolite to President Obama during his State of the Union addresses. The closest thing that comes to mind is South Carolina Congressman Joe Wilson’s infamous “you lie!” outburst during Obama’s address to Congress in 2009, but even that was widely condemned by his fellow Republicans, which is the sort of   you’ll never see Democrats do among themselves and certainly not for any slight given to this president. 11:31 pm  —   America liked it.

The time for trivial fights is behind us   …     I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.  And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and  —   Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America. Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States. ” 10:06 pm  —   Trump is concluding his address on a positive, upbeat message of American greatness. “When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God. ” 10:05 pm  —   Trump articulates a foreign policy message that harkens back to George Washington. “America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. ” 10:03 pm  —   Big applause for this: “My job is not to represent the world.  My job is to represent the United States of America. ” Trump called for NATO to pay their fair share.  10:01 pm  —   Sustained applause for this: “We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U. S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior, and a hero  —    battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ‘Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.’  Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. ”  Ryan’s wife, standing next to Ivanka Trump, holds back the tears. Trump ad libbed: “Ryan is looking down right now, and I think he’s very happy, because he just broke a record. ” Trump continues: “The Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom  —    we will never forget him. ” 9:53 pm  —   Trump says: “I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.  The office is called VOICE  —    Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. ” He then points out the stories of Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis  —   whose families were victims of illegal immigrant criminals. Very emotional reception for families who were forgotten for so long.  There was, however, an audible groan from Democrats when Trump mentioned VOICE.  Groans and murmurs in the Democratic crowd as Trump announces new VOICE program for victims of illegal immigrant violence,  —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 1, 2017,  9:52 pm  —   Trump calls for support of the men and women of law enforcement and the victims of crime. “We must build bridges of cooperation and trust  —    not drive the wedge of disunity and division. ” 9:49 pm  —   Trump repeats a line that former President George W. Bush often said, “Education is the civil rights issue of our time. ” He calls for school choice. He highlights another guest  —   Denisha Merriweather, who attended a private center of learning and “with the help of a tax credit scholarship program.  Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.  Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. ” The pride on Denisha Merriweather’s face as @POTUS tells her story of perseverance  success at private school is just amazing #trumpaddress,  —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) March 1, 2017,  9:47 pm  —   Trump introduces Megan Crowley, who was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, but her own father “founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life.  Today she is 20 years old  —   and a sophomore at Notre Dame. ” Trump highlights the story in order to call for reform of the Food and Drug Administration.  9:46 pm  —   This isn’t the sort of thing you’d expect to see from a Republican president, but it’s very much a populist message: “My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women’s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. ” 9:42 pm  —   Trump lays out his vision of Obamacare replacement.

He points out that Maureen Scalia, the late Justice Scalia’s wife is the guest of First Lady Melania Trump. Applause at the mention of his SCOTUS nominee Judge Gorsuch. 9:26 pm  —   No equivocating in this language: “As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS  —   a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.  We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. ” 9:25 pm  —   He makes the case for vetting: “We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America  —   we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. ” 9:22 pm  —   Here is the Trump who won the election: “We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border.

As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.  Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. ” He calls out Dems directly: “To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question:  what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?” 9:20 pm  —   Sad  …     Democrats laughing and hollering when Trump says he has begun to ”drain the swamp of government corruption”  —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 1, 2017,  9:18 pm  —   Trump gets applause for mentioning he cleared the way for the Dakota Access Pipeline, and we’ll be using American steel on all the pipelines. 9:16 pm  —   He explains what he has already done to keep his promises to bring jobs back to the U. S. He also mentions the stock market bump and the cost cutting savings he’s already done.

He also mentions his order to cut regulations. 9:13 pm  —   Trump sounds the same themes of his inaugural address and campaign  —   explaining the movement of the forgotten men and women who propelled his victory in order to “Make America Great Again” by putting Americans first. He gets a standing ovation. 9:10 pm  —   Trump opens with a unifying statement condemning the recent acts of   and hatred with the desecration of Jewish graves. 9:04 pm  —   And here he is. President Trump enters the Chamber. No applause from some Democrat lawmakers, just standing in stony silence. The Democrat women in white are notably silent. 9:00 pm  —   Here is the text of the prepared remarks: TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation’s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.  Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice  —    in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands.  And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world  —   friend or foe  —   will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding  —   250 years since the day we declared our Independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we’ve watched our middle class shrink as we’ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We’ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit  —   and so many other places throughout our land. We’ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross  —   and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we’ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.  The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds   —   families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus  —   as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake  —   and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first   …     because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Dying industries will come roaring back to life.  Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. It’s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I’ve made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford,   General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record.  We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new   jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government.  We have placed a hiring freeze on   and   Federal workers. We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials  —    and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job‑crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines  —   thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs  —   and I’ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel. We have withdrawn the United States from the     Partnership. With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth  —   and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.  We want all Americans to succeed  —    but that can’t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.  We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.  Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question:  what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.  We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for   offenses since   came here from outside of our country.  We have seen the attacks at home   —   from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.  Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America  —   we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe  —   and to keep out those who would do us harm. As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS  —   a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.  We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court  —   from my list of 20 judges  —   who will defend our Constitution.  I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.  Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.  To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law.  He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.   million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined. We’ve lost more than   of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we’ve lost 60, 000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters. Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party.  It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy  —   making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.  At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes  —   but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing. I just met with officials and workers from a great American company,  .  In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?  They said that it’s good.  I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales.  They told me  —   without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it  —   that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.  They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren’t even asking for change.  But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the “abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people. ” Lincoln was right  —   and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. I am going to bring back millions of jobs.  Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.  The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others  —    have a   immigration system.  It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.  Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. Switching away from this current system of   immigration, and instead adopting a   system, will have many benefits:  it will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families  —    including immigrant families  —    enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’s security, and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the   of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program  —    the building of the interstate highway system.  The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.  With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country  —    twice.  And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States  —   financed through both public and private capital  —    creating millions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles:  Buy American, and Hire American. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare. Mandating every American to buy   health insurance was never the right solution for America.  The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.  Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State  —   it is unsustainable and collapsing. One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges  —    leaving many Americans with no choice at all. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken. Obamacare is collapsing  —    and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.  Action is not a choice  —    it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans: First, we should ensure that Americans with   conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts  —    but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government. Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance  —   and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately. Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines  —    creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care. Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.  Every problem can be solved.  And every hurting family can find healing, and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more  —    so why not join forces to finally get it done?  On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people. My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women’s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.  Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.  She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan’s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.  He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life.  Today she is 20 years old  —   and a sophomore at Notre Dame. Megan’s story is about the unbounded power of a father’s love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan’s life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind  —    and the souls  —    of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of   and Latino children.  These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them. Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.  As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.  But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program.  Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.  Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest   increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4, 000 people were shot last year alone  —    and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society. Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a   job. But to create this future, we must work with  —    not against   —   the men and women of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and trust  —    not drive the wedge of disunity and division. Police and sheriffs are members of our community.  They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters  —   and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they’ll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.  The office is called VOICE  —    Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis. Jamiel’s    son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.  Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback.  But he never got the chance.  His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine. Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.  Their husbands  —    Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis  —    were slain in the line of duty in California.  They were pillars of their community.  These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.  Jenna:  I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you. To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica:  I want you to know  —    we will never stop fighting for justice.  Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and  —    if they must  —    to fight and to win. I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation  —    and now we must deliver for them. The challenges we face as a Nation are great.  But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform. We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U. S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior, and a hero  —    battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies. ”  Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity.  For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom  —    we will never forget him. To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.  It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism. But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific  —    to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people  —    and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.  My job is not to represent the world.  My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict  —   not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past  —    we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. The only   solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding. America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found.  America is friends today with former enemies.  Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars.  This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America’s centennial.  At that celebration, the country’s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter.  An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America’s 250th year. Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear  —   schools where children learn in peace  —   and jobs where Americans prosper and grow  —   are not too much to ask. When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God. And when we fulfill this vision when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began. The time for small thinking is over.  The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action. From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears  —    inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past  —    and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.  And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and  —   Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.

Speakers from the event included the ACLU, DailyKos, Food  Water Watch, MoveOn. org, Our Revolution, National Nurses United, and others.  Rosie O’Donnell also headlined the event where she called for continued resistance against the president.  O’Donnell read from the Declaration of Independence, saying, “Whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government. ” She added, “That is why we are here. ”  “This is not Russia. To Donald Trump and his pathetic band of white, privileged criminal businessmen, I would like to say to him, ‘Nyet! Sir, nyet! nyet! nyet! nyet! ’”  “No we won’t. We have seen what you have done, sir. We have seen your connection with Russia. The game is over. The Internet rules,” O’Donnell said.  She added, “He lies! He lies! He lies! He lies!” O’Donnell chanted, until several other women in the crowd repeated her words.  “And it’s about time they all started saying that, instead of it appears as if he hasn’t been speaking the truth. Cut it down to the    like he does,” she said, later adding that they were going to go “down and dirty like Donald Trump. ” “You know what the truth is? A very handsome conservative man stopped me on my way up with his iPhone, to ask me with his very charming, Irish,    face, if George Soros has paid me to come here. And I said, ‘Sir I have never met George Soros, but he seems like a lovely man. One day I’d like to share a souvlaki with him. ’” She said she’s only met Trump twice. One at his wedding to Marla Maples where she said Trump “shook the hands of the guests at the wedding as he walked down the aisle to take his vows. Warning! Warning! Warning Will Robinson!” O’Donnell said.  She added, “We will get him out! Thank you, peace and don’t fear the rain. ” 8:19 pm  —    Bernie Sanders reacts to Trump’s excerpt, ”time for trivial fights is behind us”: ”I hope he’s right” #Trumpaddress https:  .   —   Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) March 1, 2017,  8:18 pm  —    Per Fox News’ John Roberts, excerpts from Trump’s speech show the president will focus on a broad array of issues. “My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation and now we must deliver for them,” the president will say, per Roberts. “We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside of America. We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists,” Trump will also say. On Obamacare, per Roberts, Trump will say: “Tonight I’m also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care. ” The president will also call for stronger immigration enforcement. “By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars and make our communities safer for everyone,” President Trump will say, according to Fox’s Roberts. 8:07 pm  —   Some speech excerpts trickling out already, including excerpts from the Democrats’ response to Trump’s address.

She says police officers must learn how to “deescalate” situations and distinguish between what are real threats from those that aren’t. Sounding like Sanders, she says “we’ve got to do a much better job demilitarizing our police forces. ” Clinton says some of that is the legacy of   and points out that President Obama is taking steps to reverse some of the demilitarization. She talks about the need to rebuild relationships between the police and the community and says there should be “constant interactions” that should be taking place. 6:21: A questioner in the audience asks Clinton about stop and frisk in Philadelphia. He says the son of one of the mothers on stage with Clinton would be alive had it not been for stop and frisk. He wants the president to use the bully pulpit to end stop and frisk and wants to know Clinton’s thoughts and how she can aid in the effort. Clinton wants to answer and then ask Holder to answer as well. Clinton says after New York ended stop and frisk, the crime rate is at an   low and the evidence people use to justify stop and frisk doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. She hopes the federal government —  through the incentives it provides to local police departments —  can change the mindset of police departments in favor of a more “  approach. ” She says the federal government can “play a much bigger role” in providing the “carrots and the sticks” to local police departments so they don’t fall back on the “lowest common denominator. ” Holder backs up Clinton on   law enforcement policies. 6:17: When moderator asks Clinton if she is willing to “ride or die” with victims of gun violence, Clinton says they are asking all of us to “ride or die” with them. She says she has had the great fortune to have gotten to know the mothers of the movement over the last couple months and says, referencing Chelsea, “I can’t even imagine. ” She says she has the greatest respect for what they have gone through and their protests, demands. She says that is exactly what they should be doing and “we have to do more” to hold everybody responsible. She hopes “we are going to form a movement” and not just have “sporadic protests and outbursts” that doesn’t “congeal” into the change they want. 6:15: Agitators in “Mexico attire” asked to leave Maryland gym before Trump rally: Citizens wearing Mexico attire were asked to leave the gym as the crowds cheered for their release #TrumpRally pic. twitter.   —   brooke (@brookereese24) April 20, 2016,  6:12: Protester already removed before Trump’s Berlin, Maryland rally: VIDEO: Man removed from Berlin Trump rally  #shoretrump https:  .   —   DelmarvaNow!

       "        <td>Donald J. Trump had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to change out of her clothes. Ms. Brewer Lane, at the time a    model, did as Mr. Trump asked. “I went into the bathroom and tried one on,” she recalled. It was a bikini. “I came out, and he said, ‘Wow.’ ” Mr. Trump, then 44 and in the midst of his first divorce, decided to show her off to the crowd at    his estate in Palm Beach, Fla. “He brought me out to the pool and said, ‘That is a stunning Trump girl, isn’t it?’ ” Ms. Brewer Lane said. Donald Trump and women: The words evoke a familiar cascade of casual insults, hurled from the safe distance of a Twitter account, a radio show or a campaign podium. This is the public treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president: degrading, impersonal, performed. “That must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees,” he told a female contestant on “The Celebrity Apprentice. ” Rosie O’Donnell, he said, had a “fat, ugly face. ” A lawyer who needed to pump milk for a newborn? “Disgusting,” he said. But the 1990 episode at    that Ms. Brewer Lane described was different: a debasing    encounter between Mr. Trump and a young woman he hardly knew. This is the private treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the   and more intimate encounters. The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or for Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling and pageants women who had dated him or interacted with him socially and women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. In all, more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks. Their accounts  —   many relayed here in their own words  —   reveal unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd reliance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the interviews, as well as court records and written recollections. The interactions occurred in his offices at Trump Tower, at his homes, at construction sites and backstage at beauty pageants. They appeared to be fleeting, unimportant moments to him, but they left lasting impressions on the women who experienced them. What emerges from the interviews is a complex, at times contradictory portrait of a wealthy,   and provocative man and the women around him, one that defies simple categorization. Some women found him gracious and encouraging. He promoted several to the loftiest heights of his company, a daring move for a major real estate developer at the time. He simultaneously nurtured women’s careers and mocked their physical appearance. “You like your candy,” he told an overweight female executive who oversaw the construction of his headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. He could be lewd one moment and gentlemanly the next. In an interview, Mr. Trump described himself as a champion of women, someone who took pride in hiring them and was in awe of their work ethic. “It would just seem,” he said, “that there was something that they want to really prove. ” Pressed on the women’s claims, Mr. Trump disputed many of the details, such as asking Ms. Brewer Lane to put on a swimsuit. “A lot of things get made up over the years,” he said. “I have always treated women with great respect. And women will tell you that. ” But in many cases there was an unmistakable dynamic at play: Mr. Trump had the power, and the women did not. He had celebrity. He had wealth. He had connections. Even after he had behaved crudely toward them, some of the women sought his assistance with their careers or remained by his side. For Ms. Brewer Lane, her introduction to Mr. Trump at    was the start of a whirlwind romance  —   a heady blur of helicopter rides and   hotel rooms and flashing cameras. “It was intimidating,” she said. “He was Donald Trump, obviously. ” It started at the New York Military Academy, a small, severe boarding school 90 minutes’ drive north of New York City. Strictly enforced rules prohibited girls from setting foot on the   campus unless it was a special occasion. And on those special occasions, young Donald Trump paid careful mind to the kind of girls he brought to school. They had to be gorgeous  —   10s, in his future parlance. “Donald was extremely sensitive to whether or not the women he invited to campus were pretty,” recalled George White, a fellow student in the class of 1964. “For Donald,” he added, “it’s display. ” He steadily built an image as a young playboy amid the deprivations of a   military school, where most boys craved but rarely enjoyed the company of a girl. By senior year, his classmates had crowned him “ladies’ man” in the yearbook, a nod to the volume of his dates. Asked how he had earned the “ladies’ man” title, Mr. Trump at first demurred. “I better not tell you  —   I’ll get myself in trouble,” he said. He later elaborated, saying he had “a great feeling” and “a great like” for women. Mr. Trump grew up with an influential role model for how to deal with women: Fred C. Trump, his powerful and unyielding father. The elder Mr. Trump exerted control no matter how big or small the decision, as Ivana Zelnickova learned over dinner one night in the late 1970s. Her boyfriend, Donald Trump, had invited her to join his siblings and parents at Tavern on the Green, the ornate restaurant in Central Park. When the waiter came to take orders, Ivana made the mistake of asking for what she wanted. Fred Trump set her straight, she recalled in a previously unpublished interview with Michael D’Antonio, the author of “The Truth About Trump. ” Mr. Trump defended his father’s conduct. “He would’ve said that out of love,” he said. If his father had overruled her fish order, Mr. Trump said, “he would have said that only on the basis that he thought, ‘That would be better for her.’ ” The elder Mr. Trump did not hide his more traditional views on gender. When his son hired a woman, Barbara A. Res, as his head of construction in the 1980s, Fred Trump was mystified and annoyed. Mr. Trump said it was a different era. “My father,” he said, “probably never would have seen a woman in that position. ” Mr. Trump still holds up his parents as models, praising his    mother for understanding and accommodating a husband who worked almost nonstop. “My mother was always fine with it,” he said, recalling her “brilliant” management of the situation. “If something got interrupted because he was going to inspect a housing site or something, she would handle that so beautifully. ” “She was an ideal woman,” he said. With his purchase of the Miss Universe Organization, Mr. Trump was now in the business of young, beautiful women. They craved his advice and approval, a fact he seemed to understand well. Temple Taggart, the    Miss Utah, was startled by how forward he was with young contestants like her in 1997, his first year as the owner of Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she recalls it, he introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner. Mr. Trump disputes this, saying he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the lips. But Ms. Taggart said it was not an isolated incident. At the gala celebration after the show, she said, Mr. Trump immediately zeroed in on her, telling her how much he liked her style and inviting her to visit him in New York to talk about her future. Soon enough, she said, he delivered another unwelcome kiss on her lips, this time in Trump Tower. After boasting of his connections to elite modeling agencies, he advised her to lie about her age to get ahead in the industry, she said. “ ‘We’re going to have to tell them you’re 17,’ ” Ms. Taggart recalled him telling her, “because in his mind, 21 is too old. I was like, ‘No, we’re not going to do that.’ ” His level of involvement in the pageants was unexpected, and his judgments, the contestants said, could be harsh. Carrie Prejean, who was 21 when she participated in the Miss USA contest in 2009 as Miss California, was surprised to find Mr. Trump personally evaluating the women at rehearsal. “We were told to put on our opening number outfits  —   they were nearly as revealing as our swimsuits  —   and line up for him onstage,” she wrote in her memoir, “Still Standing. ” Mr. Trump, in an interview, said he would “never do that. ” Such behavior, he said, would bruise egos and hurt feelings. “I wouldn’t hurt people,” he said. “That’s hurtful to people. ” Mr. Trump was not just fixated on the appearance of the women around him. He possessed an almost compulsive need to talk about it. Inside the Trump Organization, the company that manages his various businesses, he occasionally interrupted routine discussions of business to opine on women’s figures. Ms. Res, his construction executive, remembered a meeting in which she and Mr. Trump interviewed an architect for a project in the Los Angeles area. Out of the blue, she said, Mr. Trump evaluated the fitness of women in Marina del Rey, Calif. “They take care of their asses,” he said. “The architect and I didn’t know where he was coming from,” Ms. Res said. Years later, after she had gained a significant amount of weight, Ms. Res endured a stinging workplace observation about her own body from Mr. Trump. “ ‘You like your candy,’ ” she recalled him telling her. “It was him reminding me that I was overweight. ” Her colleague Louise Sunshine experienced similar observations from Mr. Trump when she gained weight. But she saw it as friendly encouragement, not a cruel insult. “He thought I looked much better thin,” she said. “He would remind me of how beautiful I was. ” Whenever possible, Mr. Trump wanted his visitors to see his most attractive employees, as Ms. Res learned. Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances  —   at times from strangers  —   that the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to host the event from onstage. He turned to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Universe at the time, and asked for her opinion of his daughter’s body. “ ‘Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?’ ” Ms. Lee recalled him saying. ‘I was like, ‘Really?’ That’s just weird. She was 16. That’s creepy. ” Ms. Brewer Lane, who dated Mr. Trump for several months in 1990 and early 1991, said it did not take long for him to solicit her view on the attractiveness of two of his previous romantic partners, Marla Maples and Ivana Trump. Mr. Trump said he did not know Ms. Brewer Lane very well, despite dating her. “I wouldn’t have asked anybody about how they rate other women,” he said. He liked to brag about his sexual prowess and his desirability as a date, no matter who was around. Barbara J. Fife, a deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins, New York’s mayor in the early 1990s, was not especially close to Mr. Trump. But that did not stop him from telling her why he was in such a hurry one day as he sat in her office at City Hall. “I have this great date tonight with a model for Victoria’s Secret,” Ms. Fife recalled him telling her. “I saw it as immature, quite honestly,” she said. At his office in Trump Tower, Mr. Trump seemed eager for his colleagues to hear about his new companion, Ms. Maples. When The New York Post feasted on her supposed satisfaction with him in bed, captured in the headline “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had,” Mr. Trump was unabashed, Ms. Res said. Mr. Trump denies boasting about the headline. He seems more bashful these days, saying he cannot recall how many women he has dated. “Not as many as people would think,” he said. “I’m not somebody that really loved the dating process. ” To build his business, Mr. Trump turned to women for a simple reason: They worked hard  —   often harder than men, he told them. When Mr. Trump hired Ms. Res to oversee the construction of Trump Tower, he invited her to his apartment on Fifth Avenue and explained that he wanted her to be his “Donna Trump” on the project, she said. Few women had reached such stature in the industry. He entrusted several women in his company with enormous responsibility  —   once they had proven themselves worthy and loyal. Ms. Sunshine had little experience in real estate, but as a top campaign   for Gov. Hugh Carey of New York, she had fulfilled a lifelong wish for Mr. Trump: She secured him a vanity license plate with his initials, DJT, which adorned his limousine for years. Ms. Sunshine worked for Mr. Trump for 15 years, becoming a major New York real estate figure in her own right. Ms. Res remained at the company for 12 years, left after a disagreement over a project and then returned as a consultant for six more years. Both expressed gratitude for the chances Mr. Trump had taken on them. In a    industry thoroughly dominated by men, Mr. Trump’s office stood out for its diversity, recalled Alan Lapidus, an influential architect who designed the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City. To women who had climbed to positions of power outside his company, Mr. Trump’s behavior could feel like a jarring throwback. Alair A. Townsend was for a time the   woman inside New York’s City Hall during the Koch administration, with the title of deputy mayor for economic development. But when Mr. Trump called her, she said, her position seemed less relevant to him than her gender. It was an unthinking habit when he interacted with women, colleagues said. “At Trump Tower,” said Ms. Res, his longtime colleague, “he called me Honey Bunch. ” No single figure better encapsulated the paradoxes of Mr. Trump’s treatment of women in the workplace than his first wife, Ivana. He entrusted her with major pieces of a corporate empire and gave her the titles to match. She was the president of Trump’s Castle, a major casino in Atlantic City, and the Plaza Hotel, the storied complex on Central Park South in Manhattan. “She ran that hotel,” Ms. Res said. “And she ran it well. ” But he compensated her as a spouse, not a   employee, paying her an annual salary of $1 for the Trump’s Castle job, according to her tax documents. And he grew to resent her outsize role. By the end of their marriage, Mr. Trump wrote in his 1997 book, “The Art of the Comeback,” he regretted having allowed her to run his businesses. He seems to have kept his word. His current wife, Melania, has marketed her own lines of beauty products and jewelry. But Mr. Trump remains mostly uninvolved in her work. After calling it “very successful,” he struggled to describe it. “What is it on television with the sales?” he asked. “What do they call that? Not Home Shopping, the other one. ” Once his first marriage started to collapse, Mr. Trump faced his most serious allegations of aggression toward women. When “Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,” by the journalist Harry Hurt III, was released in 1993, it included a description of a night in which Mr. Trump was said to have raped Ivana in a fit of rage. It also included a statement from Ivana that Mr. Trump’s lawyers insisted be placed in the front of the book. In the statement, she described an occasion of “marital relations” during which “I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited toward me, was absent. ” “During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me,” the statement said. “I referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense. ” Mr. Trump denied raping Ivana, and she did not respond to a request for comment. After the allegation   in the news media last year, Ivana said in a statement, “The story is totally without merit. ” In the early 1990s, Jill Harth and her boyfriend at the time, George Houraney, worked with Mr. Trump on a beauty pageant in Atlantic City, and later accused Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior toward Ms. Harth during their business dealings. In a 1996 deposition, Ms. Harth described their initial meeting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower. Mr. Houraney said in a recent interview that he was shocked by Mr. Trump’s response after he made clear that he and Ms. Harth were monogamous. “He said: ‘Well, there’s always a first time. I am going after her,’ ” Mr. Houraney recalled, adding: “I thought the man was joking. I laughed. He said, ‘I am serious.’ ” By the time the three of them were having dinner at the Oak Room of the Plaza Hotel the next night, Mr. Trump’s advances had turned physical, Ms. Harth said in the deposition. “Basically he   throughout that dinner, when he wasn’t groping me under the table,” she testified. “Let me just say, this was a very traumatic thing working for him. ” Ms. Harth, who declined to comment, gave the deposition in connection with a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump had failed to meet his obligations in a business partnership. Mr. Trump settled that case but denied wrongdoing. Ms. Harth withdrew her own lawsuit against Mr. Trump alleging unwanted advances, but she has stood by her original claims. Mr. Trump said it was Ms. Harth who had pursued him, and his office shared email messages in which Ms. Harth, over the past year, thanked Mr. Trump for helping her personally and professionally and expressed support for his presidential candidacy. Mr. Trump says the world misunderstands his relationship with women. He sees himself as a promoter of women  —   a man whose business deals, like the purchase of the struggling Miss Universe pageant, have given them untold opportunities for employment and advancement. “Hundreds and hundreds of women, thousands of women, are the better for it,” he said. He has groomed his daughter, Ivanka, to run his company. And as a chief executive, he said, he admires women for a work ethic that can exceed that of the men around them. Mr. Trump recalled a telling exchange with a female worker. Several women who have held positions of power within the Trump Organization in recent years said they had never known Mr. Trump to objectify women or treat them with disrespect. “I think there are mischaracterizations about him,” said Jill Martin, a vice president and assistant counsel at the company. Ms. Martin said Mr. Trump had enthusiastically supported her decision to have two children over the past five years, even when it meant working from home and scaling back on business travel. “That’s hard with women lawyers,” she said. “For me, he’s made it a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time necessary for my family. ” After competing in the 2009 Miss USA pageant, Laura Kirilova Chukanov, a Bulgarian immigrant who lived in Utah, met with Mr. Trump in his New York office and explained that she wanted to make a documentary about her home country. Mr. Trump encouraged the project and followed through on a promise to put her in touch with his production company. “He genuinely wanted to know what I wanted to do with my life and how he could help,” Ms. Chukanov said. But when Mr. Trump lost confidence in women, he could inflict lasting damage on their lives. After Alicia Machado won the 1996 Miss Universe title, something very human happened: She gained weight. Mr. Trump did not keep his critique of her changing body quiet  —   he publicly shamed her, she said. Mr. Trump said he had pushed her to lose weight. “To that, I will plead guilty,” he said, expressing no regret for his tactics. But the humiliation, Ms. Machado said, was unbearable. “After that episode, I was sick, anorexia and bulimia for five years,” she said. “Over the past 20 years, I’ve gone to a lot of psychologists to combat this. ”</td>\n",

       "        <td>New York (CNN) At the height of the US economic boom in the 1980s, there was one clear star of Wall Street: the corporate raider,   takeover artists registering big headlines and even bigger paydays. Naturally, real estate magnate Donald Trump wanted in on the game.    The Atlantic City summer that nearly ruined Donald Trump, For Trump, his brief period as an activist investor of sorts was a lucrative turn in his career    at one point netting him more than $200 million for just a handful of targets    but also a controversial one. His profits were real, but so was the appearance of strategy that brought allegations of stock manipulation from rivals, regulators and lawmakers. It’s a four   Trump, now the Republican presidential nominee, never mentions on the campaign trail. Yet his venture into the     world of the ”Barbarians at the Gate” offers a window into the   strategy that forms the basis for Trump’s presidential campaign    and remains the stated approach the New York billionaire plans to deploy with vigor from the Oval Office should he win.  ”I have made billions of dollars in business making deals    now I’m going to make our country rich again,” Trump pledged during his speech accepting the nomination at the Republican National Convention last month. A CNN examination of the period included the review of hundreds of pages of testimony, depositions, financial and legal documents as well as interviews with more than a dozen former state and federal regulators, lawyers, executives from targeted companies and former Trump organization employees. It reveals a game plan for the novice,   corporate raider that bears striking resemblance to the playbook deployed by Trump the novice politician. It lays clear his penchant for operating without the advice    or even acknowledgment    of top advisers, placing a heavy emphasis on using the media to further his efforts and deploying   tactics punctuated by efforts to mislead, bully and even punish opponents. The central issue for many was whether Trump was engaged in the tactic known as ”greenmailing.” It was an entirely legal strategy repeatedly deployed by activist investors throughout the 1980s    a practice that, for lack of a better description, amounts to a corporate ransom payment. It works like this: An investor quietly buys up a significant amount of a targeted company’s stock and threatens a takeover attempt. The company, in an effort to make the investor just go away, makes a deal to buy that stock back at a premium. The investor nets the difference.  It’s a practice that has all but disappeared in the decades since, snuffed out by a series of state laws and a federal excise tax designed explicitly to rid companies of the threat many deemed as stock manipulation. But it was, at the time, legal    something Trump himself made clear when he testified in April 1987 before the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.   ”The practice is a totally legal practice, however, it’s something, the name, greenmailer, is not a very pretty word,” Trump said, according to a transcript of the hearing that CNN obtained. ”It’s a practice that on Wall Street is very open and common and done quite a bit.” It was an offhanded, unsolicited defense of a practice Trump, and his legal team, repeatedly and vigorously claimed he didn’t engage in. Explaining how he made $30 million in four months off stock of the parent company of   Inn, Trump said simply that it’s business. ”Well if you consider making a profit on the stock, you know, a goal, I guess I achieved it,” Trump told the casino commissioners. ”I would have rather found a cure for cancer, but I didn’t, so I have no choice, so I made some money on the stock.”  READ: Clinton Foundation becomes campaign issue, Trump, on the campaign trail, has no apologies for the tactics used throughout his business career. As he told The Washington Post, ”I wasn’t representing the country. I wasn’t representing the banks. . .. I was representing Donald Trump. So for myself, they were all good deals.” Asked to make someone available to discuss Trump’s strategy and thinking during this period, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, declined in an email, saying: ”We will pass. Thanks for reaching out.” First target: Holiday Inn, For Trump, his play in the market came as other business opportunities were beginning to slow down. Like other activist investors of the 1980s, the target was undervalued companies. Trump’s endgame wasn’t always clear, according to Dan Lee, who as a casino analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert at the time was in regular contact with Trump about the potential targets and became one of his most trusted, though unofficial, advisers.  Takeovers were an option, but so was the possibility that the stock would simply rise enough for Trump to sell and make money, Lee, now the CEO of Full House Resorts Inc. said in an interview with CNN. One thing, according to Lee, Trump held that others in the business didn’t: a willingness to try.   ”He was willing to think out of the box, and he was willing to think differently than others,” Lee said. ”He was constantly pushing    ’Why can’t we do that? Why can’t we do this?’ He was pretty incorrigible in that way.” It turned out to be a competitor    one Lee agreed at the time was undervalued    that became Trump’s first target: Holiday Corp. Trump had a contentious relationship with Holiday Corp. before he ever started buying stock in the company. The Trump Organization and Holiday skirmished repeatedly over their joint ownership of a casino in Atlantic City. They traded lawsuits, one of which included Trump’s description of himself as ”an entrepreneur who has achieved national and international prominence, reputation, and recognition as the result of the outstanding success he has achieved in conceiving, developing, and promoting various enterprises.” Eventually, Trump would buy out Harrah’s ownership in the property in March 1986, seemingly putting an end to the drama. Five months later Trump went after the casino operator’s parent company.  Trump quietly began buying Holiday Corp. stock that August, and shortly after, instructed investment bank Bear Stearns to do the same    just not under his name. It was a deliberate effort to dodge federal reporting requirements that would have tipped the company off to his intentions, according to a complaint the Federal Trade Commission later filed. ”He wanted to accumulate as much as possible before he had to notify the target,” said Jeffrey Zuckerman, the former director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, who oversaw the suit. ”That’s what this was all about.” By the time Trump was done, he would hold 4. 9% of the company’s shares    and send the company’s management scrambling to block what appeared to be a takeover attempt. That reaction wasn’t  . Trump had amassed the reputation and cachet crucial to pulling off the kinds of hostile takeovers then dominating the headlines with names like Carl Icahn, T. Boone Pickens and Nelson Peltz. He was a newly minted billionaire with his own plane, helicopter, Fifth Avenue skyscraper and an oceanside compound in Palm Beach. He was the largest developer in Atlantic City and had the type of relationship with Wall Street banks that all but guaranteed he could get financing to take down any target. There were also clear strategic reasons why Trump would want to acquire the company. Trump had long been looking for a way into the Nevada gaming market, and Holiday, with two casinos in the state, offered the opportunity to make that happen.  As Trump finalized his stake in the company, articles started to appear with ”  sources” in Trump’s orbit attacking the company’s management and threatening a takeover. A former Trump Organization official who worked with Trump during the period told CNN ”it was almost always Trump who was the unnamed source or sources” in these stories. The effort had its intended effect. Holiday Corp. ’s board would, by that November, propose a $2. 8 billion plan to restructure the company’s debt    one that gave shareholders a $65 per share dividend. The intent was clear: Block Trump’s takeover effort. The company’s stock price jumped. Trump sold his stock. He made more than $30 million in four months, having never presented a tender offer to the company.   ’A gaming license is not a hunting license’ It was one of two deals Trump pursued that directly affected the gaming industry and, as such, drew scrutiny from gaming regulators. Takeover efforts    or feints in that direction    were center stage at Trump’s April 1987 casino license renewal hearing in New Jersey. ”A gaming license is not a hunting license,” Walter N. Read, the   chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, told Trump’s lawyers at a 1987 hearing, according to a transcript CNN obtained. The state’s gaming rules, Read pointedly continued, do ”not encompass the use of a casino license as a weapon to weaken or undercut the financial integrity of its competitors.” Yet that, according to Read, was exactly what Trump had done over the course of the previous year. Trump’s emergence on the scene in Atlantic City had been generally welcomed by state gambling regulators. A   New York developer, Trump had a laudable attention to detail, a focus on building the best    and most competitive    casinos, and perhaps most notably, no sign of ties to the organized crime families that caused endless headaches for state officials, according to Carl Zeitz, a commissioner at the time. Trump repeatedly told regulators his goals in accumulating the stock of his competitor and former partner were not only benign, but also not at all informed by his past relationship or deep knowledge of the company. ”I purchased it as an investment in a company that I thought was undervalued at the time,” Trump said of his sizable stake.  Asked if he thought he was the reason the company moved quickly to restructure, he pleaded ignorance. ”I mean, it’s possible it did, to be perfectly honest, it’s very possible, but I don’t know.” Trump’s legacy in Atlantic City under scrutiny  Asked if he thought the restructuring was good for the company, Trump said simply: ”I don’t think it was.” He was right. Holiday Corp. was wounded. By 1988, the company’s management was forced to engineer the sale of its Holiday Inn franchise and the company’s parts were sold off for significant value for shareholders. Thousands of employees at the company’s Memphis, Tennessee, headquarters eventually would be laid off in the process. Trump, for his part, took to pointing out that by definition, his actions with Holiday Corp. weren’t greenmailing. He sold his stock on the open market, not back to the company at a premium. But that was more luck than strategy. As Trump made clear in his testimony, the stock jumped so much it was the only logical move. Despite his claims to the contrary, he’d explicitly broached the idea of selling his stock back to the company for a premium, the company’s CEO, Michael Rose, told the commission. ’When I do research on things, they never work out well’ Trump didn’t let his Holiday Corp. payday sit for long. Within days he’d picked out another target, one that just so happened to be another competitor in the casino business: Bally.  Again, he instructed Bear Stearns to do the same on his behalf, but under its name. He would use his Holiday proceeds to purchase $14. 8 million in Bally stock, Trump acknowledged in his casino commission testimony. The total fell deliberately just short of the $15 million line that would trigger a need for federal notification. The whole strategy, according to Zuckerman, the former FTC official, was simple: ”You’re trying to keep it quiet.”  But while Trump’s ability to establish a major position in these companies quietly was clearly strategic, his rationale for doing so appeared less so    at least according to him. In fact, when it came to Bally, he got the idea of going after the company from a single conversation with a single analyst    Dan Lee, his trusted confidante from Drexel Burnham, Trump told a Bally lawyer in a deposition reviewed by CNN. In that deposition, taken during a suit filed by Bally after Trump amassed 9. 9% of the company’s stock, Trump said he hadn’t even looked at the company’s proxy statements before he shelled out millions. He finally held a meeting with advisers from Bear Stearns after he’d purchased his stake in the company. ”I wanted to start to learn a little bit about the company,” Trump said of that first meeting. ”I figured it was not a bad time to start.” Over the course of the depositions and testimony CNN reviewed from the period, it was a regular theme from Trump    one with familiar echoes to his presidential campaign. While Trump had close advisers, ”Trump will do what Trump wants to do. And often he’ll do it without telling them at all,” one former Trump Organization executive, who was with the businessman during this period, said in an interview. The executive, who requested anonymity so as not to harm his existing relationship with Trump, recounted how most activist investors had teams of lawyers, analysts and advisers poring over the details of a potential target. Trump, on the other hand, wasn’t even aware Bally had had health clubs    a significant line of the company’s business    when he first started buying the company’s stock. Trump, in his testimony in front of the casino commission, put it like this: ”I just felt instinctively    when I do research on things, they never work out well.” Bally’s management, not unlike Holiday Corp. ’s, didn’t take kindly to the news Trump had become one of the company’s biggest shareholders and even less so to the idea that Trump, according to his testimony, was interested in ”a friendly transaction” with the company. They sued. Trump countersued. Eventually, the company made an offer on another casino    the Golden Nugget    as a poison pill of sorts. Trump, it turns out, pegged the eventual result of that deal accurately, noting ”the debt load will obviously have a significant negative impact on the company,” according to an affidavit he filed as part of his legal    with the company.  ”It suddenly created a situation in Bally Corp in which Bally, to protect itself from Donald Trump the corporate raider, had to go out and buy a second place,” Zeitz, the New Jersey casino commissioner at the time, told CNN.  By February 1987, a deal was reached: The company would purchase 2. 6 million shares for $24 per share. The shares were trading at $19. 75 that day. Trump would also receive an additional $6. 2 million for his troubles. ”He was certainly greenmailing,” said Zeitz, now a Democrat supporting Hillary Clinton. ”There’s no doubt that was going on. That’s why Bally went out and made a really stupid deal.” Asked during his casino license hearing if he had greenmailed the company, Trump said no. ”If I really wanted to, to use your term, greenmail, I could have probably done this a lot sooner and a lot easier and not have to go through all of the expensive litigation and the expense of, you know, the fight,” Trump told the casino commissioners. ”I’m not a person that, despite what people think, particularly loves litigation.” Asked if he considered himself a greenmailer, Trump demurred: ”I would rather say I sold my stock back to the company as opposed to greenmail, if I could do that. I’m not sure. I hate to refer to myself as a greenmailer.” Behind the scenes though, Trump was blunt about what he’d accomplished, according to John O’Donnell, a former Trump Organization executive. ”Donald had bought a sizable chunk of Bally stock, then induced the company to buy it back at a premium to avoid a takeover    ’greenmail,’ as the practice is known,” O’Donnell wrote in his 1991 book ”Trumped! The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump    His Cunning Rise and Spectacular Fall.”  Trump’s lawyer at the time, Nicholas Ribis, made their position clear: ”The record is clear in Mr. Trump did not buy stock with the intent of seeking a premium but, rather, to make a sound investment.” In 1990, Trump agreed to pay out $2. 25 million to Bally shareholders who sued the billionaire and the company for allegedly artificially inflating the stock’s price during their negotiations over Trump selling the stock back to the company. American Airlines     one target too many? Over the course of three years, with Holiday Corp. and Bally and followed by companies including Allegis Corp. and Federated Department Stores, Trump netted more than $200 million.   But complaints about his tactics continued    so much so that Nevada state legislators pushed legislation explicitly designed to block Trump from targeting casinos in their state. And in 1988, Trump agreed to pay a $750, 000 federal fine the same day the FTC filed a complaint alleging he dodged federal stock notification requirements due his agreement with Bear Stearns    though Trump admitted no wrongdoing. Zuckerman, now the chair of the antitrust practice at Curtis,   Colt  Mosle LLP, said the fault for that civil suit lies more with the investment bank, which pitched several of its clients the idea, than Trump himself    a fact not lost on Trump, who at the time said he planned to force Bear Stearns to pay him back for the fine.  By 1989, Trump launched his biggest    and most brazen    effort of his career, notifying American Airlines executives via fax that he’d acquired a significant amount of the company’s shares and was preparing a $7 billion takeover bid.  ”Donald was playing a favorite game, a carbon copy of his raids on the gaming industry three years before,” O’Donnell, the former Trump executive, said in his book. ”The plan, as I saw it, was to spotlight the airline’s value, force its board of directors to restructure, thus inflating the price of the stock, or make them run up the white flag and submit to a greenmailing. Either way, he was hoping to stuff millions of dollars into his pocket.” Market analysts questioned whether Trump could actually muster the financing for the deal. Airline insiders couldn’t figure out how Trump could ever pull it off. The airline’s   CEO, Bob Crandall, made it clear he wouldn’t negotiate or pay ransom. It turns out, he wouldn’t have to.  That very weekend, the financing of a separate, unrelated takeover effort of another airline by another investor fell through. A market crash followed, with airline stocks leading the way. Trump’s nascent effort never recovered, and he dropped it altogether within nine days. Analyst estimates at the time pegged his paper losses at more than $100 million. It was an unfriendly capstone to Trump’s corporate raider period    one punctuated by impressive success for a market   but also plagued by controversy. As he told the New Jersey casino board: ”I think my only goal was, as an investor, it’s a game that we all have to play, I guess is, to try and come out with more than what you put in. In that sense, yes, I achieved that goal.”  </td>\n",

       "        <td> (CNN) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump met Sunday for their second presidential debate, and CNN’s Reality Check Team spent the evening analyzing their claims. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate and selected key statements from both candidates, rating them true mostly true true, but misleading false or it’s complicated.  Obamacare, Reality Check: Trump on Obamacare premiums, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney  Trump cited Obamacare as one of the top problems he wants to address if he is elected president. ”When I watch the deals being made and watch what’s happening with horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care are going up by numbers that are astronomical. By 68% 59% and 71%,” Trump said. It’s true that some insurers are raising some of their plans’ premiums by that much, but that’s not the typical increase. Insurers have requested a rate hike of 9% on average, for the benchmark silver plan for 2017, up from 2% for this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The vast majority of Obamacare enrollees, however, don’t see those massive hikes. Some 85% of them receive federal subsidies that can lower their premium to less than 10% of their income. Verdict: True, but misleading. Reality Check: Clinton on 90% insured rate, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, Clinton praised Obamacare as providing health insurance for 20 million people who didn’t have it before.  ”Right now, we are at 90% health insurance coverage. That’s the highest we have ever been,” she said. Clinton is right that the largest share of Americans now have health insurance. It’s actually even more than 90%. The uninsured rate was 8. 6% in the first three months of this year, according to the National Health Interview Survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  That means a record 91. 4% of Americans were insured. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Canadians traveling for health care, By Debra Goldschmidt, CNN, In response to a question on Obamacare, Trump said, ”If you ever noticed Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States, in many cases because their system is so slow it’s catastrophic in certain ways.” According to a 2015 report by the conservative Canadian think tank Frasier Institute, ”In 2014, more than 52, 000 Canadians received   medical treatment outside Canada.”   The 52, 000 is an increase of about 10, 000 from the previous year. The report last year said one reason for patients traveling abroad is the long wait times in Canada, which were reported to be nearly 10 weeks for treatments deemed medically necessary. The report itself says it does not have exact numbers but assumes it underestimates. That said, 52, 000 Canadians is a miniscule percentage of the more than 35 million Canadians who receive benefits.  While the report doesn’t say how many patients travel to the US for medical treatment, we rate Trump’s claim as true, but misleading. Reality Check: Clinton wants   system? By Debra Goldschmidt, CNN, Trump said Clinton ”wants to go to   which means the government basically rules everything.” He went on to say, ”Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step.” In July, Clinton said she supported a public option, which is a government health plan as a choice alongside private health insurance options. This is different than a   system, which is a singular,   system without other options to chose from. The goal of adding a public option would be to stabilize Obamacare, which has seen several large insurers downsize their presence and premiums rise as insurers try to deal with    enrollees. Obamacare had created   cooperative insurers to give consumers more choice, but most of those carriers have failed. Last month, in response to a question posed by the New England Journal of Medicine on how she would improve on quality and access to care, Clinton said she wants to build on the progress of Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, something she has said before. Clinton wrote, ”We must work to expand Medicaid coverage in the 19 states that have left 3 million Americans without health insurance because their states refused to expand Medicaid and enroll people eligible for coverage. We need to improve and strengthen the ACA through enhanced tax credits to make coverage affordable, implementation of strong measures to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, increased competition between insurers, and an aggressive campaign to increase outreach and enrollment. And finally, we need to ensure the availability of a public option choice in every state, and let Americans over 55 buy in to Medicare.” The medical journal asked the same question to Trump but he has yet to respond. He has said Obamacare should be repealed.   We rate Trump’s claim that Clinton wants a   system as false. ’Birther’ claim, Reality Check: Trump claims 2008 Clinton campaign source of Obama photo in Somali garb, By Theodore Schleifer, CNN, Trump told Clinton that ”your campaign” was responsible for circulating photos during the 2008 primaries depicting Barack Obama dressed in traditional Somali garb, a famous   during the Democratic primary eight years ago. Well, sort of.  The photo first appeared on Drudge Report, the conservative aggregator, and was attributed at the time to sources within the Clinton campaign, though no names were offered. The Obama campaign pounced on the report, blasting it as ”divisive politics” and ”part of a disturbing pattern.” The Clinton campaign at the time did not immediately dispute that it was responsible    its first statement did not address the substance of the allegation.  ”This is nothing more than an obvious and transparent attempt to distract from the serious issues confronting our country today and to attempt to create the very divisions they claim to decry. We will not be distracted,” her aides said at the time. The campaign said later that it had not been sanctioned by the campaign   but was not definitive about where it originated. ”We have over 700 people on this campaign and I’m not in a position to know what each one of them may or may not have done,” campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said at the time. Previous questions about the Clintons’   attacks on Obama have been blamed on volunteers, who might not have been ”sanctioned” by the campaign. Clinton’s campaign brass pointed the finger at a ”volunteer coordinator” in Iowa who shared the photo, which was part of what Trump said was an effort to discredit Obama’s heritage and legitimacy. The volunteer was clearly backing Clinton and organizing on her behalf in the     primary state. But it’s not certain whether the volunteer was drawing a paycheck from her campaign and therefore an official Clinton actor. ”I don’t recall whether they were an actual paid staffer,” former Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle told CNN earlier this year. ”But they did forward an email that promoted the conspiracy.” Verdict: It’s complicated. Clinton’s emails, Reality Check: Trump on Clinton emails, By Ryan Browne, CNN National Security Producer, Trump returned to a common theme, slamming Clinton for her use of personal email during her tenure as secretary of state. ”You think it was fine to delete 35, 000 emails? I don’t think so. She said that 33, 000 emails had to do with her daughter’s wedding, number one, and a yoga class.” He added, ”for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39, 000 emails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.” Clinton handed 30, 000 emails over to the State Department and said she deleted another 32, 000 personal messages. So the number was actually 32, 000, not 39, 000, 35, 000 or 33, 000, as Trump charged. Of the 32, 000 emails the FBI was able to find, more than 17, 000 of them and determined that a ”substantial number” were duplicates of emails that had already been turned over to the State Department. The State Department has reviewed about 15, 000 of the emails and determined that more than 9, 400 were purely personal and will not be released and that another 5, 600 are probably   and will be made public in the weeks before the election. But he is partially right about the description Hillary gave for the emails that were deleted, thousands of which have been found to be work related.  Back in March 2015, when the server’s existence was first revealed, Clinton downplayed the email as being ”about planning Chelsea’s wedding or my mother’s funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.” Trump’s three numbers are all inaccurate and the State Department confirmed that the majority were personal. Therefore, we rate Trump’s claims about the numbers as false. But true that Clinton downplayed emails that turned out to be  . Reality Check: Can Trump appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton? By Jamie Crawford, CNN National Security Producer, ”If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception,” Trump told Clinton. ”There has never been anything like it, and we are going to have a special prosecutor. I go out and speak and the people of this country are furious.” But would Trump be constitutionally empowered to take such an action if he were elected the 45th president of the United States? Under Title 6 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the attorney general does have the authority to appoint a special prosecutor, according to Stephen Vladeck, a law professor with the University of Texas School of Law.  Such action can be taken when the attorney general determines that a criminal investigation is warranted and that an investigation by the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest or ”other extraordinary circumstance” and that ”under the circumstances it would be in the public interest to appoint and outside special counsel.” But the prosecutor would need to bring charges and that might a difficult proposition in the current climate, in the face of the comments by FBI Director James Comey earlier this year at the conclusion of the FBI investigation into whether or not Clinton broke the law in her use of a private email server. In July, Comey said that Clinton had been ”extremely careless” in her use of a private email server in which classified material was was sent over in small amounts. But Comey also said ”our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case” when he announced that the FBI would not recommend the Justice Department bring criminal charges against Clinton over the matter. ”I just don’t see a scenario where, if the director of the FBI doesn’t believe criminal charges can or should be brought, a subsequent Justice Department would bring them anyway,” Vladeck said of the political situation after Comey’s comments. But in practical terms regarding the legality of Trump’s promise, the only constraints are the ones set out in the federal regulations. And would Trump be able to ”instruct” his attorney general to undertake such an investigation? Vladeck points out that the attorney general is supposed to be at least somewhat independent, but at the end of the day, the President can fire him or her for no reason. So in reality, the President could demand that the AG appoint a special prosecutor or else be fired.  That is essentially what led to the ”Saturday Night Massacre” during the Nixon administration when President Richard Nixon dismissed Archibald Cox during the investigation of Watergate. But that incident ended up being a significant factor in turning the public tide against Nixon in the scandal that eventually brought down his presidency. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Clinton on Russia and hacking, By Justin Gamble and Kate Grise, CNN, Clinton said Russia was behind the hacking of systems related to the Democratic Party and then releasing thousands of emails in an attempt to influence the presidential election to favor Trump. ”Our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election and WikiLeaks is part of that as are other sites where the Russians hack information,” she said. ”We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election,” Clinton continued. ”And believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. They’re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump” Trump was not so convinced that the Russians were behind the hacks. ”Anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians. She doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking,” he said. ”Maybe there is no hacking, but they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia is because they think they are trying to tarnish me with Russia.” The intelligence community had been debating whether they should ”name and shame” the Russians for the cyberattacks because of some concerns about the strength of the evidence and fears that it would be seen as a political statement to help Clinton’s election. However, on Friday, the Obama administration said it was ”confident” Russia was behind recent hackings of the Democratic National Committee emails and the sites of other Democratic   organizations over the summer. ”We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities,” the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. The statement went on to say that the hackings and then publishing of these emails are ”intended to interfere with the US election process.” Russia has denied all involvement in hacking attacks on US servers and organizations, saying the accusations are ”nonsense.” While there has been speculation that the hacking benefits Trump as it has targeted Democrats and Clinton, the intelligence community has not reached that conclusion. So on Trump’s claim that it is not known if there is any hacking, we rate the claim false. On Clinton’s opinion that the hack is meant to benefit Trump may be her hunch, but not the conclusion of investigators. We rate that false as well. Bill Clinton, Reality Check: Bill Clinton’s law license, Paula Jones settlement, By Sonam Vashi, CNN, Trump went after Clinton’s husband tonight.  ”But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law, he had to pay an $850, 000 fine to one of the women    Paula Jones, who’s also here tonight.” The day before he left the Oval Office in 2001, Bill Clinton agreed to a suspension of his Arkansas license to practice law for five years, after giving misleading testimony during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.  The suspensions, and his payment of a $25, 000 fine to the Arkansas bar association, was in exchange for the end of the   Whitewater probe. The suspension of Clinton’s license closed the disbarment proceedings in Arkansas. Clinton is still listed as suspended on the Arkansas judiciary government website, although it’s been 10 years since the end of his suspension. That same year, after the suspension of his Arkansas license, the Supreme Court disbarred Clinton from practicing law before it, a routine decision that happens if lawyers have been suspended or disbarred elsewhere. The action was mainly a symbolic one, since Clinton had never argued in a Supreme Court case, and Clinton was given 40 days to fight against the disbarment. Instead, Clinton resigned from the bar of the Supreme Court    again, a symbolic gesture. Trump is also correct on the $850, 000 figure. Paula Jones is a former Arkansas state employee who accused Clinton of making ”persistent and continuous” sexual advances toward her while he was governor. She filed a federal lawsuit in 1994, and Clinton settled the lawsuit in 1998, paying out $850, 000 to Jones and her lawyers. Clinton wasn’t disbarred in Arkansas, but he did lose his license for a time. Trump’s claims are true. Reality Check: Clinton on  ’ incomes rising under Bill Clinton, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, Hillary Clinton praised the prosperity America enjoyed during the administration of her husband, Bill. In addition to saying millions of jobs were created and everyone’s income rose, she specifically cited how   benefited. ”  incomes went up 33%,” she said. The typical   household’s income rose to $40, 830 in 2000, up 31. 5% from 1992, just before Clinton took office, according to Census Bureau data. That’s an even more robust increase than Americans as a whole. Overall, the typical American household saw its income climb to $57, 790, up 13. 9% from 1992. While Clinton was slightly off on the numbers, our verdict: True. Iraq, Reality Check: Trump would not have had US in Iraq, By Eve Bower, CNN, Trump again claimed that he would not have supported the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Specifically, he said, had he been president, he ”would not have had our people in Iraq,” and Captain Humayun Khan would still be alive. Khan was killed in combat in Iraq in 2004, and was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star. Khan’s parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, gained national prominence after speaking critically of Trump at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In reality, Trump was on the record as being supportive of the Iraq War as early as a month before Congress voted to authorize military force in Iraq in 2002, as well as soon after the invasion. He didn’t express his outright opposition to the war until more than a year later, in an August 2004 interview. We rate Trump’s continued insistence that he would not have led America into war in Iraq as false. Taxes, Reality check: Trump says Clinton would raise taxes on everyone, By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney, Trump claimed Clinton would be ”raising everybody’s taxes massively.” Clinton has proposed raising taxes on the   Americans, but not anyone making less than $250, 000. Independent analyses of her plan find that her proposed tax hikes would squarely hit the most well off. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center noted that ”nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes.” The Tax Policy Center will soon publish an updated analysis of her tax plan to incorporate new tax proposals she made over the summer. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Clinton says Trump would raise taxes on   families, By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney, Clinton said that despite claims that he would cut taxes for everyone, Trump actually ”would end up raising taxes on . .. millions of   families.” Clinton was referring to a study that estimated his proposals would raise the tax burden on millions of   and   parents. A leading Democratic tax policy expert conducted the study, but the conservative Tax Foundation said it replicated many of her numbers and found her conclusions ”reasonable.” The study estimated that roughly 20% of households with minor children and more than half of single parents could end up paying more in taxes than they do today. These groups include about 25 million adults and 15 million children. What explains the tax impact? While Trump would increase the standard deduction and add new child care tax breaks, he would also raise the lowest tax bracket to 12% from 10% eliminate the head of household status and repeal some personal exemptions. Many single parents could find that tradeoff leaves them with a higher tax bill, the study found. Verdict: True. Terrorism, Reality Check: Trump says Assad, Russia and Iran are ’killing ISIS’ By Jamie Crawford, CNN National Security Producer, Trump said the following about the fight against ISIS. ”I don’t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy” But is Trump right that those three countries are ”killing” ISIS amid the bloody civil war convulsing the country? Backed up by Russian military power, the Assad regime has targeted what it commonly refers to as ”terrorists” but that has primarily meant various groups who are specifically acting to depose the Assad government. Some of those groups include groups the United States also sees as being capable to assist the primary aim of the   coalition which is to dislodge ISIS from its base in Syria and Iraq. Russia insists it has been targeting ISIS forces since it entered into military action inside Syria in support of the efforts of the Assad regime, but US officials have said the majority of Russian airstrikes have been against   rebels battling Assad’s forces, as opposed to ISIS. That was one of the reasons US efforts to establish a mechanism where Russia and the United States might cooperate to increase the pressure on ISIS fell part. Earlier this year, Secretary of State John Kerry said Iran had been ”helpful” in targeting ISIS on their own inside portions of Iraq, but there has been little evidence of Iranian forces targeting ISIS inside Syria in support of the Assad regime. Iranian forces in Iraq did play a key role in some of the critical battles that dislodged ISIS from Tikrit and Baiji, and other portions of northern Anbar province where ISIS had a large presence. Syrian forces backed up by the Russian military have also been accused of targeting civilians inside Syria and launching attacks that have indiscriminately killed thousands of Syrian civilians throughout the course of Syria’s civil war    most recently in Syria’s largest city, Aleppo. Because there has been no visible effort by Assad regime forces to go after ISIS, and with the Russian military not using overwhelming force to go after ISIS in Syria, but to focus on going after groups that opposes Assad, we rate Trump’s claim false. In Iraq especially, US officials and others have noted Iran’s role in targeting ISIS as one of the reasons the group has lost ground there, but the picture of Iran’s role against ISIS in Syria is not as clear. We would rate his comment as true, but misleading. Reality Check: Trump suggests   don’t cooperate with law enforcement, By Amy Gallagher and Emma   CNN, A voter asked what the candidates would do to help   who are being ”labeled as a threat” and are targets of Islamophobia.   Trump   her question by calling on the Muslim community to do more to report terrorism.  ”We have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on,” said Trump. ”As an example in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed and wounded many, many people. . .. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.” We have checked the claim about witnesses to the bombs in the San Bernardino shooters’ apartment before and have found that there is no evidence that anyone saw the bombs and did not report them.  There is also no evidence that Muslims in the terrorists’ community had information and withheld it. On Trump’s larger point, the Muslim community has actually been more effective than law enforcement at uncovering potential terror attacks in America since  .  Charles Kurzman, professor at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill conducted a study in 2013 to examine the relationship between   and terrorism on American soil. He found that ”Since   54   terrorism suspects and perpetrators were brought to the attention of law enforcement by members of the   community out of 188 individuals where the initial tip was made public. Another 52 individuals were discovered through US government investigations.”    We rate Trump’s suggestion that   don’t cooperate with law enforcement false. Reality Check: Trump on radical Islamic terrorism, By Travis Caldwell, CNN, In a response to rising Islamophobia in America, Trump suggested that the terrorist attacks in Orlando and San Bernardino, as well as the events of   were a direct result of ”radical Islamic terrorism” and stated Clinton and President Barack Obama won’t use the phrase. First, a breakdown of the events Trump mentions. The attacks on September 11, 2001, were coordinated and carried out by al Qaeda, an Islamic extremist terror network. According to law enforcement officials, the San Bernardino shooters may have been   following a warped and extremist version of Islam. The terror group ISIS claimed credit for the San Bernardino shootings, but it has yet to be determined if the shooters and members of ISIS made contact or received instruction.  The Orlando shooter cited himself as an ”Islamic soldier” during his talks with police negotiators, but like the San Bernardino attacks, officials believe the shooter acted as a ”lone wolf” and was radicalized by online sources.  At face value, the attackers noted by Trump were indeed beholden to a radicalized ideology. Verdict: True. Trump also criticized Clinton and Obama for their failure to use the phrase ”radical Islamic terrorism.” Clinton, however, told CNN’s ”New Day” in June that she did not object to the phrase when used properly, saying, ”From my perspective, it matters what we do more than what we say. . .. And it mattered we got (Osama) bin Laden, not what name we called him. I have clearly said we    whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I’m happy to say either. I think they mean the same thing.” Obama spoke with CNN’s Jake Tapper last month on his particular reluctance to use the phrase, saying, ”The truth of the matter is that this is an issue that has been sort of manufactured, because there is no doubt, and I’ve said repeatedly, that where we see terrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL, they have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse, for basically barbarism and death.”  Clinton doesn’t object to the phrase so we rate Trump’s claim as false. Obama may call the issue a distraction, but he refuses to use the term. That claim is true. Clinton’s fortune, Reality Check: No, Hillary Clinton did not use her office to make $250 million, By Theodore Schleifer, CNN, Trump was curious why Clinton had not devoted any of her personal fortune to his campaign, like he has to his. But his charge included a curious datapoint. ”She made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money,” Trump claimed. The main way the Clintons made money: private speeches. The speaking fees    and what Clinton said to financial audiences behind closed doors    emerged as a major campaign issue during the Democratic primary, with her rival Bernie Sanders repeatedly calling for the release of the transcripts. And the money she made was another sign of what critics said was a disconnect between the life of the secretary of state and the life of the average American. But that number’s not right. Clinton delivered 92 paid speeches between April 2013, when she was a private citizen, through March 2015, right before she launched her presidential campaign. But those remarks only yielded $21. 6 million    an average speaking fee of $235, 000, according to a CNN analysis of her payments. Trump may have been misspeaking and meaning to reference a different number: $150 million, which is the amount that both Clintons collected during their time after office. When you include Bill Clinton’s 637 paid speaking engagements from February 2001 to May 2015, the total Clinton fees rises to $154 million split over 729 speeches. And if you throw in other sources of income, the two Clintons’ intake does indeed arrive to the $250 million ballpark. Forbes reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton earned $230 million between 2001 and 2014 through advising and consulting gigs, book deals and speaking fees. But a majority of that money came from Bill Clinton, who has had a much lengthier tenure outside of public office. As for how much she has contributed to her campaign, Clinton has made $1. 2 million in   contributions to her campaign. So we rate the $250 million total, ascribed purely to Hillary Clinton, to be false. Jobs, Reality Check: Trump says Clinton ’failed’ to bring jobs to upstate N. Y. By Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney, Trump criticized Clinton’s record as a senator representing New York, saying: ”Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.” As a senator, Clinton promised to bring 200, 000 jobs to upstate New York. She did not. Upstate New York consists of 49 counties, according to the New York Federal Reserve. It does not include New York City and its surrounding suburban counties. Clinton became a senator in January 2001 and her last full month in office was December 2008. During that time, employment in the metro area of Syracuse increased by 5, 029 workers. However, the unemployment rate in Syracuse was 4. 8% at the start of 2001 and, like much of the nation, rose in 2008 to 6. 7% Labor Department figures show. Ithaca also had jobs gains but a rise in the unemployment rate. In Binghamton’s metro area, employment declined by 3, 600 workers during Clinton’s term. In Rochester, employment declined by 5, 600 workers. In a December 2007 report, the New York Federal Reserve found private sector job growth in upstate New York declined 0. 2% on average per year between 2000 and 2005. Job growth did pick up in 2006 and 2007. The region did lose 85, 000 manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2006. However, that was in line with the national trend. While Clinton was a senator, the US economy lost about 4. 2 million manufacturing jobs due to improved technology and trade. The New York Fed noted in its report that the manufacturing job losses in upstate New York ”appear unlikely to be reversed.” The manufacturing job losses also weren’t entirely offset by job gains in   industries such as health care, education and hospitality, the report found. Verdict: Mostly true. Trade, Reality Check: Trump on $800 billion trade deficit, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, Trump once again blasted America’s trade deals and once again gave the wrong figure for the nation’s trade gap. ”Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It’s hard to believe. Inconceivable,” Trump said. The nation had a nearly $763 billion deficit in the trading of goods in 2015, according to Census Bureau figures. But America is shifting to a service economy and exports $262 billion more in services than we import. That brings our overall trade deficit down to $500 billion for 2015. Verdict: False. Trump’s insults, Reality Check: Clinton on the people Trump has insulted, By Kate Grise, CNN, Clinton said Trump has insulted many different groups. ”We have seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to 10. We’ve seen him embarrass women on TV and Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe on the harshest most personal terms. So, yes. This is who Donald Trump is. It’s not only women and this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president. Because he has also targeted immigrants,   Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims and so many others,” Clinton said. Let’s break down some of Clinton’s points. ”We have seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to 10,” Clinton began. In a 2005 interview with Howard Stern, Trump said, ”I view a person who’s   as very hard to be a 10.” He then proceeded to rank a list of celebrity women on a scale from one to 10 as Stern provides him with their names. Stern suggested Trump should start a ”Donald Trump evaluation show” to give weekly ratings on women. ”You know that would be a very good show for Sirius I think,” Trump agrees. ”You do that for hours and hours. It would get tremendous ratings.” We rate Clinton’s claim as true. ”We saw him after the debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe on the harshest most personal terms,” Clinton said. In the days after the first presidential debate last month, Trump repeatedly defended his statements about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. ”She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem, we had a real problem, not only with that but her attitude, and we had a real problem with her,” Trump said on Fox News. Trump went after Machado on Twitter as well    ”Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U. S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?”  We rate Clinton’s claim as true. ”He has also targeted immigrants,   Latinos, people with disabilites, POWs, and Muslims and so many others,” Clinton said. Trump on immigrants: ”But you have people coming in and I’m not just saying Mexicans. I’m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists and they’re coming into this country,” Trump said on CNN’s ”State of the Union” last year. During the first presidential debate, Trump said, ”We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they’re illegally here, illegal immigrants, and they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.” Trump on  : ”You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed    what the hell do you have to lose?” Trump on Latinos: ”When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,” Trump said in his presidential announcement speech in June last year. Trump on people with disabilities: At a rally last November, Trump mocked a disabled reporter by impersonating him. Trump said that he did not know the reporter, so therefore he could not have been mocking him. Trump on POWs: ”He’s not a war hero,” Trump said of Sen. John McCain who was a prisoner of war during the Vietman War. ”He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.” Trump on Muslims: Trump has called for surveillance of mosques, religious tests for immigrants that would prevent Muslims from entering the country and compiling a national database of Muslims living in the United States.

       "        <td>There was the time Donald J. Trump told Larry King that he had been paid more than $1 million to give a speech about his business acumen when in fact he was paid $400, 000. Or the time he sought a bank loan claiming a net worth of $3. 5 billion in 2004, four times as much as what the bank found when it checked his math. Or the time he boasted that membership to Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N. Y. cost $300, 000 when the actual initiation fee was $200, 000. Or the time he bragged on CNBC about his new Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas, claiming, “We have 1, 282 units, and they sold out in less than a week. ” As Mr. Trump knew, more than 300 units had not been sold. Confronted in a court case about this last untruth, Mr. Trump was anything but chagrined. “I’m talking to a television station,” he said. “We do want to put the best spin on the property. ” As Mr. Trump prepares to claim the Republican nomination for president this week, he and his supporters are sure to laud his main calling card  —   his long, operatic record as a swaggering business tycoon. And without question, there will be successes aplenty to highlight, from his gleaming golden   to his   golf resorts, hit TV shows and   books. But a survey of Mr. Trump’s four decades of wheeling and dealing also reveals an equally operatic record of dissembling and deception, some of it unabashedly confirmed by Mr. Trump himself, who nearly 30 years ago first extolled the business advantages of “truthful hyperbole. ” Indeed, based on the mountain of court records churned out over the span of Mr. Trump’s career, it is hard to find a project he touched that did not produce allegations of broken promises, blatant lies or outright fraud. Under the intense scrutiny of a presidential election, many of those allegations have already become familiar campaign fodder: the Trump University students and Trump condo buyers who say they were fleeced the public servants from New Jersey to Scotland who now say they rue the zoning approvals, licenses or tax breaks they gave based on Mr. Trump’s promises the   contractors who say Mr. Trump concocted complaints about their work to avoid paying them the infuriated business partners who say Mr. Trump concealed profits or ignored contractual obligations the business journalists and stock analysts who say Mr. Trump smeared them for critical coverage. Taken as a whole, though, an examination of Mr. Trump’s business career reveals persistent patterns in the way Mr. Trump bends or breaks the truth  —   patterns that may already feel familiar to those watching his campaign. First and foremost is Mr. Trump’s tendency toward the   fib  —   as if it were not impressive enough to be paid $400, 000 for a speech. What also emerges is a nearly reflexive habit of telling his target audience precisely what he thinks it wants to hear  —   such as promising Trump University students they will learn all his real estate secrets from his “handpicked” instructors. And finally, there is the pattern already deeply familiar to his political opponents  —   making spurious claims against adversaries under Mr. Trump’s   theory that the best defense is a   offense. Equally striking is his Houdiniesque ability to wiggle away from all but the most skilled and determined efforts to corner him in an apparent lie. In interviews, lawyers who have tangled with Mr. Trump in court cases are sometimes reduced to sputtering, astonished rage, calling him “borderline pathological” and “the Michelangelo of deception” as they attempt to describe the ease with which Mr. Trump weaves his own versions of reality. “He’s a bully, and bullies aren’t known for their veracity,” said Richard C. Seltzer, a retired senior partner at the law firm Kaye Scholer who confronted Mr. Trump in three real estate lawsuits. In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Trump defended his integrity as a businessman  —   “I shoot very straight”  —   and argued that those who accuse him of acting in bad faith are often the same people he has outmaneuvered in deals. “What, you’re going to quote people that I’ve beat? Are you going to quote people that I  ?” he asked, adding, “I’ll give you hundreds of names of people that have dealt with me that say I’m very honest. ” Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is already hard at work making the case that Mr. Trump’s   business record is a harbinger of how he would mislead from the Oval Office. Her campaign has even put up a    website: www. artofthesteal. biz. Mr. Trump’s business record may help explain why various   have barely been able to keep pace with his false claims on the campaign trail. PolitiFact has labeled 34 of Mr. Trump’s assertions “Pants on Fire” lies. As of July 1, The Washington Post had   46 statements by Mr. Trump. It gave 70 percent of them its worst rating, four Pinocchios  —   a record so abysmal that the newspaper recently compiled a video of what it called “Donald Trump’s most outrageous   claims. ” The taxonomy of Mr. Trump’s business deceptions has been the subject of legal and journalistic scrutiny for decades. A Fortune magazine article from 2000 memorably described Mr. Trump’s “astonishing ability to prevaricate” this way: “But when Trump says he owns 10 percent of the Plaza Hotel, understand that what he actually means is that he has the right to 10 percent of the profit if it’s ever sold. When he says he’s building a ‘  building’ next to the U. N. he means a   building that has   ceilings. And when he says his casino company is the ‘largest employer in the state of New Jersey,’ he actually means to say it is the eighth largest. ” The casino magnate Steve Wynn, a sometimes friend and sometimes foe of Mr. Trump’s, took up the subject of Mr. Trump’s honesty in an interview with New York magazine. “His statements to people like you, whether they concern us and our projects or our motivations or his own reality or his own future or his own present you have seen over the years have no relation to truth or fact,” Mr. Wynn said. Some of the earliest documented examples of Mr. Trump’s deceptive business tactics come from none other than Mr. Trump, who in books and in interviews sometimes seems to delight in describing the brazen bluffs and   trickery he used to claw his way to the upper echelons of New York City’s cutthroat real estate world. “You have to understand where I was coming from,” Mr. Trump wrote in his 1987    “The Art of the Deal. ” “While there are certainly honorable people in the real estate business, I was more accustomed to the sort of people with whom you don’t want to waste the effort of a handshake because you know it’s meaningless. ” Mr. Trump was particularly proud of a stratagem he employed in 1982, when he was trying to entice Holiday Inn to invest in a casino he was building in Atlantic City. The board of directors decided to visit Atlantic City, which worried Mr. Trump because he had precious little actual construction to show off. So Mr. Trump ordered his construction supervisor to cram every bulldozer and dump truck he could find into the nearly vacant construction site. “What the bulldozers and dump trucks did wasn’t important, I said, so long as they did a lot of it. If they got some actual work accomplished, all the better, but if necessary, he should have the bulldozers dig up dirt from one side of the site and dump it on the other. ” A week later, when Mr. Trump escorted the Holiday Inn executives to the site, one board member wanted to know why a worker was filling a hole he had just dug. “This was difficult for me to answer, but fortunately, this board member was more curious than he was skeptical,” Mr. Trump wrote, boasting that weeks later Holiday Inn agreed to invest in his casino. “That’s called ‘business,’” Mr. Trump said on Friday of the episode. In court cases against Mr. Trump  —   USA Today counted 3, 500 lawsuits involving Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump estimates he has testified more than 100 times  —   plaintiffs’ lawyers frequently return to the same two paragraphs from “The Art of the Deal. ” “I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration  —   and a very effective form of promotion. ” In depositions, lawyers have repeatedly probed for the limits of Mr. Trump’s “truthful hyperbole,” or, as one lawyer framed it, the distinction Mr. Trump makes between “innocent exaggeration” and “guilty exaggeration. ” For example, in the   Trump University litigation, Mr. Trump was asked in a deposition about a script that had been prepared for Trump University instructors. According to the script, the instructors were supposed to tell their students the following: “I remember one time Mr. Trump said to us over dinner, he said, ‘Real estate is the only market that, when there’s a sale going on, people run from the store.’ You don’t want to run from the store. ” No such dinners ever took place, Mr. Trump acknowledged. In fact, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single one of the instructors he claimed to have handpicked, even after he was shown their photographs. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump was not bothered by the script’s false insinuation of real estate secrets shared over chummy dinners. Asked if this example constituted “innocent exaggeration,” Mr. Trump replied, “Yes, I’d say that’s an innocent exaggeration. ” On Friday, Mr. Trump argued that the script might fall under the legal concept of “puffery”  —   which many legal dictionaries define as an exaggeration or statement that “no reasonable person” would take as factual. And in any event, he continued, the true sinners in the Trump University case are the students who sued him even after giving rave reviews in their written evaluations of the seminars. “I think that’s dishonest,” he said. Mr. Trump has been repeatedly accused of bringing false legal claims to avoid paying debts and evade contractual obligations. As far back as 1983, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump filed a “spurious” lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. Then there was the case Mr. Trump brought against Barbara Corcoran, the real estate broker best known for her appearances on “Shark Tank. ” In the   Mr. Trump owed millions of dollars to Ms. Corcoran for helping him secure financing for a development. But when New York magazine published a cover story about the troubled project  —   “Trump’s   Experience”  —   Mr. Trump sued Ms. Corcoran, accusing her and her associates of sharing damaging information with the magazine and thus violating a confidentiality agreement. He refused to pay her the millions he owed, claiming her breach had gravely damaged his business. At trial, Mr. Trump was unable to produce a single document showing harm to his business. But his certitude never wavered, even after Ms. Corcoran’s lawyer, Mr. Seltzer, confronted him with article after article in which Mr. Trump himself had discussed with reporters much of the same “confidential” information he accused Ms. Corcoran’s team of divulging. “There is something very belligerent about the way he presents facts, as if he thinks nobody will have the balls to stand up to him,” Mr. Seltzer said in an interview. (In dismissing Mr. Trump’s suit against Ms. Corcoran, the judge said the only damages he could identify were to Mr. Trump’s “bruised ego. ”) In Friday’s interview, Mr. Trump denied filing frivolous court cases, insisting, “I’ve won a massive majority of the litigation I’ve been involved in. ” He pointed to the USA Today survey of his 3, 500 legal cases. Although the newspaper could not determine who had prevailed in the vast majority of the cases, it did find Mr. Trump the clear winner in 450 suits and the clear loser in 38. And, indeed, for all of the litigation Mr. Trump has attracted or spawned, for all of the times he has been accused of ruinous dishonesty, the legal and regulatory record is surprisingly bare of official findings by judges, juries or regulators that Mr. Trump engaged in perjury or improper deception or actual fraud. A rare exception came after Mr. Trump decided to demolish a department store to make way for his Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Trump’s demolition contractor hired about 200 unauthorized Polish laborers, paying them as little as $4 an hour to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week. The case ended up in federal court after some workers were shortchanged even these wages. Mr. Trump protested that he knew nothing about the use of unauthorized workers  —   even though workers testified that they saw him visiting the site and some witnesses said that Mr. Trump and the executive he assigned to oversee the demolition were well aware of what was going on. In 1991, a federal judge, Charles E. Stewart Jr. ruled that despite Mr. Trump’s denials, there was “strong evidence” that he and his subordinates and his contractor had conspired to hire the Polish workers and deprive them of employment benefits. He awarded them $325, 415 in damages. But in case after case, Mr. Trump has displayed a special talent for turning what should be cold hard facts into semantic mush. Perhaps the most famous example of this skill came when Mr. Trump was asked under oath a seemingly straightforward question: Had he ever lied about his net worth? Mr. Trump responded, “My net worth fluctuates and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings. ” So, he explained in a deposition, when he said membership costs $300, 000 to his Westchester golf club, that included the $200, 000 initiation fee plus every cent he guessed that a member might spend on annual dues over the next 20 or 30 years. In other words, “The way I say it is more accurate. ” And when he told Larry King he was paid more than $1 million for a speech, it was not his fault if viewers failed to realize he was including not just his $400, 000 speaking fee but also the hundreds of thousands of dollars he assumed must have been spent promoting his appearance. Part of what makes Mr. Trump such an elusive target is that his paper trail is often minimal. Mr. Trump has repeatedly testified that he does not use computers. He says he also throws away his day planner each month, and just last year he testified that he did not own a smartphone. “Unlike Hillary Clinton, I’m not a big email fan,” he said, leaving open the question of how he posts to Twitter. Mr. Trump is also adept at deflecting blame to his staff. In two of his books, Mr. Trump made the startling and, as it turned out, bogus claim that he had once performed the remarkable feat of climbing out from under more than $9 billion in debt. Mr. Trump blamed his ghostwriter for the mistake. Asked if he reads his books before publication, Mr. Trump said, “I read it as quickly as I can because of time constraints. ” Mr. Trump is also the beneficiary of miraculously   memory lapses. In suit after suit, the man who claims to possess one of world’s best memories suddenly seems to have chronic memory loss when asked about critical facts or events. Such was the case when Mr. Trump filed a libel lawsuit against Timothy L. O’Brien, the author of “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald. ” Among other things, Mr. Trump asserted that “TrumpNation” cost him a “deal made in heaven” with a group of Italian investors, men he had met and who were on the brink of signing a business partnership that would have made him hundreds of millions of dollars. Their names? He could not recall. “TrumpNation” also cost him a hotel deal with Russian investors, he said. He could not remember their names, either. He was certain the book also ruined a deal with Turkish investors. Again, he could not recall any names. Polish investors also got cold feet after they read Mr. O’Brien’s book. Their names escaped him, too. The book also scared off investors from Ukraine. Alas, he could not think of their names either. Mr. Trump’s lawsuit was dismissed.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Washington (CNN) Donald Trump on Wednesday gave a major speech attacking presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and CNN’s Reality Check Team put the billionaire’s statements and assertions to the test. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speech and selected key statements, rating them true mostly true true, but misleading false or it’s complicated. Reality Check: Trump criticizes leaders for offshoring, but Trump brands also did it, By John Newsome, CNN, Trump criticized politicians and business leaders, arguing that they created policies that allowed and encouraged the offshoring of American jobs to America’s competitors. ”We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism    focusing on what’s good for America’s middle class    to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move wealth and workers to foreign countries, all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy itself,” Trump said. A CNN investigation shows that Trump and his businesses offshored jobs to a number of countries, including Bangladesh, Indonesia, and even China. Trump cut a deal with the global apparel giant PVH to manufacture his clothes in 2004, the company told CNN. And ever since, the Donald J. Trump Collection has been produced by factories in Central America and Asia, then shipped to the U. S. for sale in stores and online. CNN purchased several of Trump’s clothing items in 2016, whose tags indicated they were manufactured throughout Asia. We rate Trump’s claim that policies allowed and encouraged offshoring as accurate, but Trump left out his own role in that process with his businesses. For that reason, we rate his claim as true, but misleading. Reality Check: Trump started off with a ’small loan’ By Jeremy Diamond and Sonam Vashi, CNN, ”I started off in Brooklyn, New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business that today is worth well over $10 billion,” Trump said. We reported on this claim last October. That small loan from Trump’s father was worth $1 million, probably given before Trump entered the Manhattan real estate market in the early 1970s. If Trump’s father made the loan in 1968, the year his son graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, that $1 million would be worth $6. 8 million in today’s dollars, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. Trump has built up a    net worth, expanding his father’s lucrative real estate business to new heights. But while much of Trump’s success is a credit to his work, he was born into a successful, wealthy family, inheriting part of his father’s more than $200 million net worth. Trump’s narrative of   his entire fortune doesn’t quite hold up either    The Washington Post Fact Checker found that he profited from loans, loan guarantees, his father’s connections and trusts to help create his empire. Trump has boasted over and over that his net worth is $10 billion, but it’s unclear how true that really is. Last year, Forbes rated his net worth as $4. 5 billion    less than half of what Trump claims. We’ve only gotten a glimpse of Trump’s financial details, especially as Trump has refused to release his tax returns (because he’s being audited, he claims) but we know he’s worth at least a billion. Given that for almost all Americans, $1 million is hardly a small loan, especially back in 1968, we rate his claim that he started his business with a ”small loan” as false. Reality Check: Trump on Clinton’s landing in Bosnia, By Laura Koran, CNN National Security Producer  Near the top of his speech, Trump raised an incident from 1996, when Clinton was first lady and traveled to Bosnia in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. ”I remember landing under sniper fire,” Clinton told a crowd at George Washington University in 2008 when she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination against  . Barack Obama. ”There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.” Trump called that account ”phony” in his speech Wednesday, adding, ”The attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers . .. a total   lie.” RELATED: Trump fires back    his 15 nastiest zingers on Clinton, Clinton acknowledged that she ”misspoke” shortly after she told the story, responding to accusations by Obama campaign officials that she exaggerated the story. In fact, news footage of Clinton’s arrival showed her walking calmly from her Air Force plane with her   daughter Chelsea, stopping to talk with several people at the airport, including an    Bosnian girl. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Clinton allowed China to steal intellectual property, By Tal Kopan, CNN, Trump hit Clinton on China on a number of points. He alleged that she was responsible for the theft of ”billions and billions of dollars in our intellectual property, and China has taken it. And it’s a crime which is continuously going on, and it’s going on right now.” His prepared remarks were even more direct: ”She let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property    a crime which is continuing to this day.” While it is true that China has stolen intellectual property from United States entities for years, he offered no explanation for his assertion that Clinton let it go on. China has waged a steady campaign to take trade secrets and intellectual properties from American companies both through traditional espionage and cyberespionage. The Justice Department has gone after Chinese individuals on both accounts, charging five Chinese military officials in 2014 for hacking American companies and stealing intellectual property, a case that took years to build, and have charged other individuals with infiltrating companies as employees to steal information for China. In 2012, former National Security Agency director and Cyber Command chief Keith Alexander called Chinese hacking ”the greatest transfer of wealth in history,” a line that has often been repeated by top officials. President Barack Obama himself has called out this behavior, pressing Chinese President Xi Jinping in    talks in 2013 in California on the topic of cybersecurity and continuing the pressure today. In a report this week, cybersecurity firm FireEye found that successful Chinese hacking against U. S. companies has decreased since the two countries signed an agreement in September to not engage in cybertheft of intellectual property    but found that it still continues at a substantial level. The State Department is not responsible for stopping Chinese hacking. The Treasury Department ultimately decides on sanctions, the Justice Department brings legal actions, and the White House and State Department work together to apply diplomatic and public pressure. Clinton engaged in this process as secretary of state, issuing a statement after a hack of Google in 2010 that they suspected originated in China, saying, ”We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.” And the Chinese behavior also started before the Obama administration and has vexed the U. S. government for years. For these reasons, we rate Trump’s claim that Clinton let China steal intellectual property as false. Reality Check: Trump claims Orlando shooter’s father is a Taliban supporter, By Tony Marco, CNN, ”The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive   and   regimes on Earth,” Trump said. Seddique Mateen, the father of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, is from Afghanistan but is not a supporter of the Taliban. In fact, he says he is a longtime opponent. He strongly condemned the group in an interview with CNN. CNN also carefully translated and analyzed numerous commentary videos Seddique Mateen posted on YouTube over the years and found no evidence of Taliban support    in fact, the opposite. (One particular quote has been mistranslated by some news organization as support for the Taliban. Close review by CNN’s translators makes it clear that the word ”Talib” he used referenced support for young people, not the terror group.) The elder Mateen lumps ISIS, al Qaeda and the Taliban all together as terrorists that are allowed to breathe and grow and must be eliminated. In his interview with CNN, he calls these groups ”the enemy of humanity.” Verdict: False. Reality Check: Trump on trade deficit increasing 40% while Clinton was secretary of state, By Chris Isidore and Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, Trump said Clinton should be ”scorned” because the nation’s trade deficit with China soared 40% while she was secretary of state. ”Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state    a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned,” he said. Actually, the trade deficit rose only 12% if you look between 2008 and 2012, which is the most accurate way to measure what happened under her tenure, which ran from early 2009 until early 2013, according to federal trade data. However, if you   the data from 2009 to 2012, the deficit jumped 34%. But that’s because the trade gap narrowed during the depths of the recession in 2009. Either way, Trump’s assertion is exaggerated. Therefore, we rate it as false. Reality Check: Trump on losing nearly   of manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China admitted to World Trade Organization, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, Trump lashed out at Clinton’s support of trade agreements that he said were ”among the most destructive ever signed.” Specifically, Trump cited the North American Free Trade Agreement, which   Bill Clinton signed in 1994, and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization in late 2001, for which the former president smoothed the way. ”We’ve lost nearly   of our manufacturing jobs since these two   agreements were signed,” Trump said. RELATED: American manufacturing isn’t dead yet, The presumptive Republican candidate is exaggerating the figures a bit. The nation has lost 27% of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was signed in 1994. The sector, which employed 16. 9 million people back then, now has 12. 3 million workers. But that masks the fact that the industry actually expanded it payrolls slightly under the remainder of Bill Clinton’s term. The bleeding really began in the early 2000s and continued through and immediately after the Great Recession. Manufacturers, however, have been adding jobs since early 2010. Employment is up 7. 3% since then. Yet it’s not clear how much free trade deals drove the decline in manufacturing employment. Corporate America was already shifting jobs to   countries, and technology already made it more costly for U. S. companies to produce goods here. Also, today’s factory jobs require more education and skills, leaving many   Americans on the sidelines. RELATED: Is trade really killing middle class jobs? Trump also said that the nation will lose millions more jobs if Hillary Clinton is elected because she will adopt the   Partnership agreement, which the former secretary of state had supported but now opposes. His comments here are misleading, too, because only Congress has the power to ratify trade agreements. We therefore rate Trump’s statement as true, but misleading, because there were many other factors beyond trade that led to the decline in manufacturing employment after China entered the WTO.  Reality Check: Trump on Clinton speeches, By Cristina Alesci and Laurie Frankel, CNNMoney, Trump said Clinton made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests in less than two years after she left her job as secretary of state in early 2013. ”When she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests, and, in less than two years, secret speeches that she does not want to reveal, under any circumstances, to the public,” he said. A CNN analysis showed that Clinton gave 92 speeches between 2013 and 2015. Her standard fee is $225, 000, and she collected $21. 6 million dollars in just under two years. Clinton made eight speeches to big banks, netting $1. 8 million, according to the analysis. John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, has said in April that Clinton won’t release transcripts from speeches given to Wall Street unless it becomes a political norm.  Verdict: True. Reality Check: Trump claims Clinton accepted $58, 000 in jewelry, By Cristina Alesci and Laurie Frankel, CNNMoney, Trump said, ”Hillary Clinton accepted $58, 000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was secretary of state    plus millions more for her foundation.” Clinton did receive   gold, sapphire and diamond earrings, a necklace and a bracelet worth $58, 000, according to the State Department website. That gift was recorded in September 2012. The former secretary did accept the jewelry and justified it by saying that not doing so would’ve ”would cause embarrassment to donor and U. S. government.” However, Clinton was not allowed to keep the jewelry. Under State Department rules, if a gift over $350 cannot be refused, it automatically becomes property of the U. S. government, and the recipient must report the gift and transfer it to the Office of the Chief of Protocol within 60 days. As for donations from Brunei to the Clinton Foundation, that is true. The government of Brunei donated between $1 million and $5 million to the foundation, according to its website. Trump also said the ”Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.  Brunei became the first East Asian nation to adopt Sharia law in 2014. Our verdict on the jewelry: true, but misleading. Although she received the gift, she turned it over to the U. S. government as required by law. Reality Check: Trump claims Clinton support for ’regime change’ caused Syrian bloodshed, By Eve Bower, CNN, Trump fiercely criticized Clinton’s Middle East policy during her tenure as secretary of state, claiming her ”support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen.” It is true that the civil war in Syria has been one of the deadliest in modern history: according to a recent U. N. estimate, since the start of hostilities in early 2011, more than 400, 000 Syrians have been killed. But it is difficult to determine how much of Syria’s fate can be attributed to a Clinton proposal that was never adopted. In April 2012, Clinton indeed advocated for the ”overthrow” of Syrian President Bashar   according to a State Department document released by Wikileaks as part of her email archive. (The email was undated but references a statement made ”last week” to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak about ”the toppling down of Assad.” Barak made that statement on April 19, 2012, dating Clinton’s email in late April.) In the leaked message, Clinton pressed for a multilateral intervention in Syria, writing, ”Only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.” Specifically, she advised, ”Washington should start by expressing its willingness to work with regional allies like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar to organize, train and arm Syrian rebel forces.” Clinton was not alone in calling for the end of Assad’s rule. Almost one year earlier, in August 2011, President Barack Obama had said ”the time has come for President Assad to step aside.” But crucially, at the time, Obama refused to pursue regime change, saying, ”The United States cannot and will not impose this transition upon Syria.” It appears that Obama persisted in his opposition. The New York Times, citing unnamed administration officials, said that in the summer of 2012, Clinton had been working on a plan with   Director David Petraeus to arm Syrian rebels but that Obama ”rebuffed” their plan. Because it is impossible to attribute the ongoing bloodshed of the Syrian civil war to the rejected policies of a secretary of state now out of office for more than three years, we rate Trump’s claim FALSE. Reality Check: Trump on Clinton’s support for the Iraq War, By Kate Grise and Laura Koran, CNN, Trump also took shots at Clinton’s record on the war in Iraq. ”It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the war in Iraq in the first place,” he said. He added, ”Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.” Clinton did vote in favor of the Iraq War resolution in October 2002. Years later, Clinton said her vote was a mistake. Verdict: True. However, Trump’s claim that he was one of the first to criticize the Iraq War is less clear. In an interview with Howard Stern on September 11, 2002, Trump said that he supported invading Iraq after Stern asked him if he was ”for invading Iraq.” ”Yeah, I guess so,” Trump responded. ”I wish the first time it was done correctly.” The Washington Post seems to have the earliest quote from him criticizing the invasion. Trump told the paper at a 2003 Oscars   days after the invasion that ”the war’s a mess.” He was more vehement in an August 2004 Esquire Magazine interview, saying of the invasion, ”I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C’mon.” Trump has also tweeted the link to a July 2004 Reuters article titled, ”Donald Trump Would ’Fire’ Bush Over Iraq Invasion” to emphasize his opposition. But these statements were made after the war began, mostly in 2004. There’s no indication he said anything along the lines of ”Do not attack Iraq” before the invasion began, as he has previously claimed. Verdict: It is true that Trump did criticize the war shortly after it began, but his claim that he criticized the war before it started is false, especially when considering his statement of support for the war to Stern before Congress voted for the invasion. Reality Check: Trump on American taxes, By Kate Grise and Tami Luhby, CNN, ”We are, by the way, the highest taxed nation in the world. Please remember that,” Trump said. As CNN’s Reality Check team did when Trump made this claim in the past, we’ll look at each part of his claim that American individuals and businesses pay more taxes than any other country. Do Americans really pay more individual taxes than citizens of any other country in the world? Hardly.  America ranked 16th out of the 34 Organization for Economic   and Development member countries for average rate of income tax and employees’ social security contributions. In America, that rate is 25. 6%. In Belgium, the country with the highest average rate of income tax and employees’ social security contributions, citizens pay 42%. Germany, Denmark, Austria and Hungary round out the top five countries with the highest average rate of income tax and employees’ social security contributions. OECD’s 34 member countries are advanced, industrialized nations, which makes their data valuable in comparing the United States to similar countries. China, Russia and India are not included in the OECD’s list because they are not member countries. We can also look at total tax revenue as a percentage of the country’s gross domestic product. This time, America ranks even lower: 27th out of 34 OECD member countries in 2014. America’s tax revenue is 26% of the country’s GDP. Denmark tops the list with its tax revenue being equal to 50% of the country’s GDP. Looking at whether American citizens face the highest taxes, we rate Trump’s claim as false. Turning to companies, it’s true that American businesses face the highest official corporate tax rate. The federal rate stands at 35%. But that’s not what many companies actually pay. The Government Accountability Office found that large, profitable U. S. corporations paid an average effective federal tax rate of 12. 6% in 2010 thanks to things such as tax credits, exemptions and offshore tax havens. In each year from 2006 to 2012, at least   of all active corporations had no federal income liability, according to the GAO. RELATED: The country with the highest income tax in the developed world, U. S. corporate tax collection totaled 2. 6% of GDP in 2014, according to the OECD. That was the 16th highest rate among the 34 nations. So when it comes to American corporations, we rate Trump’s statement as true, but misleading. The United States has the highest official corporate tax rate, but that’s not what many companies actually pay. Reality Check: Clinton and the Benghazi attacks, By Ryan Browne and Laura Koran, CNN, Trump slammed Clinton’s response to the September 11, 2012, attacks on the U. S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the death of four Americans, including the ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens. Here is what Trump said: ”Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds and hundreds of requests for security. They were desperate. They needed help. Hillary Clinton’s State Department refused them all. She started the war that put them in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.” During her testimony on Capitol Hill before the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi last year, Clinton acknowledged that ”a number of” requests were made but added, ”I did not see them. I did not approve them. I did not deny them.” During the same hearing, Rep. Mike Pompeo,   estimated that about 600 requests or concerns were raised with regard to Benghazi and Libya. A State Department independent investigation into the attack chaired by former Amb. Thomas Pickering and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm. Michael Mullen found that senior officials in the State Department had ”demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability . .. in their responses to security concerns posed by the Special Mission Benghazi.” The investigatory board, though, did conclude that no employee ”engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities.” However, the report also notes that while most of the requests were not fully fulfilled, some measures and concerns were addressed, at least in part. Because State Department officials were deemed responsible for not adequately responding to security concerns and because Clinton was secretary of state at the time    even though there is no evidence that Clinton was directly responsible for the inadequate response    Trump said it was ”Clinton’s State Department” that ignored the requests not Clinton herself. However, because Trump overstates his claim and says ”all” requests were refused and because he later implies that Clinton herself ”denied him the security he asked for,” we rate this claim as false. Trump also made the assertion that Clinton attributed the attack to an online video that was critical of Islam: ”To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death,” Trump said. Trump cites a family member of one of the victims as evidence that Clinton attributing the video as the cause of the incident. That person was the mother of Sean Smith, who told Fox News, ”She lied to my face.” Some of the family members of the victims have indeed said that Clinton misled them on the cause of the attack, but did not mention the video. Kate Quigley, sister of CIA operative Glen Doherty, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that in the wake of the attack Clinton had mentioned protests but not a video. ”She spoke to my family about how sad we should feel for the Libyan people because they are uneducated and that breeds fear, which breeds violence, and leads to a protest,” Quigley said, adding that Clinton chose to ”perpetuate what she knew was untrue.” While some administration officials, including   to the U. N. Susan Rice, did not immediately call the attack a   terror operation, emphasizing the video and protests, it is less apparent that Clinton attributed the attack directly to the online video. In a statement made immediately after the attack, Clinton mentioned the video but did not tie it directly to the attack, saying, ”Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet.” But in an email exchange from the night of the attack, Clinton told her daughter Chelsea    who was using the pseudonym ”Diane Reynolds”    that the attack was launched by ”an al   group.” A few days later, on September 21, Clinton publicly labeled the attack an act of terrorism, saying, ”What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans.” RELATED: Some of Hillary Clinton’s   emails released, Because Clinton’s email exchange indicates terrorism’s role in Benghazi and because there is conflict between family members about whether a video was mentioned, there’s no way to determine conclusively the veracity of Trump’s claim. For that reason, we rate this it’s complicated. Editor’s Note: This post has been updated after a review of the previous conclusion. Reality Check: Trump claims Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund, By Cristina Alesci and Laurie Frankel, CNNMoney, According to Trump, Clinton ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes and many others in exchange for cash. To make this claim, Trump cited several examples from the book ”Clinton Cash” by Peter Schweizer. Among the accusations: Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America’s uranium holdings to Russia while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. While the deal to sell Uranium One to a Russian company was completed in 2010, there’s no hard evidence of a quid pro quo. Even Schweizer admits there’s no smoking gun. According to The New York Times, although significant donors to the foundation stood to benefit from the transaction, which allowed a Russian company to buy the rights to   of U. S. uranium deposits, ”Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown.” CNN several times has asked the Clinton Foundation to confirm whether the nine investors who benefited from the deal also contributed to the foundation, but the foundation has yet to respond. RELATED: Russian company seeks to buy U. S. uranium mining operations, But even if foundation donors profited from the sale of Uranium One, the State Department was one of several agencies that needed to sign off on the transaction. The Treasury’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the Unites States, an interagency body that reviews deals that could result in a foreign entity owning a US business, reviewed and approved the sale. The committee includes representatives from nine agencies, including the State Department. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Trump on Clinton’s increase in refugees from Syria, By Kate Grise, CNN, ”In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that’s an increase over President Obama’s already very high number,” Trump said. ”Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth    with no way to screen who they are or what they believe,” he continued. Clinton said on CBS’s ”Face the Nation” on September 20 that she would like to see the United States accept more refugees than Obama’s plan to increase to 10, 000 per fiscal year 2016. ”Look, we’re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more, and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10, 000 to 65, 000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in,” Clinton said, implying that her figure, like Obama’s, was per fiscal year. That would be a 550% increase in total refugees, so we rate that part of Trump’s claim as true. However, Trump continued saying that there is no way to screen those immigrants. There is a vetting system in place, which begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, according to the White House. This group collects identification documents, performs an initial assessment, and interviews applicants to confirm refugee status and the need for resettlement. They then refer strong candidates for resettlement to the United States. The Resettlement Support Center compiles a file on each refugee and then the security checks begin. The National Counterterrorism Center, FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the State Department are all involved in these security checks. Before arrival in the United States, refugees are interviewed, fingerprinted and given medical screenings, among other security checks. Finally, they arrive in the United States, go through U. S. Customs and Border Protection’s National Targeting Center and then must apply for a green card within a year of arrival, which triggers another set of security procedures. While it is true that there is no screening system that is foolproof, to say that there is no way to screen refugees or that Clinton believes that they should not be vetted is false. Reality Check: Trump on Clinton’s server being hacked, By Tal Kopan, CNN, Trump asserted that Clinton’s private email server was hacked when she was secretary of state. ”Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments, perhaps even by her financial backers in communist China,” he said. ”I’m sure they have it, putting all of America and our citizens in danger.” While it is true that Clinton used a   server for email during her time as secretary of state, there has been no conclusive evidence that the server was compromised, nor any indication that foreign governments were involved in any attempts to do so. Two law enforcement officials told CNN that security logs turned over from the server showed no apparent signs of hacking. They cautioned, though, that does not show definitive proof that no one ever got in, as skilled hackers may have been able to cover their tracks. In a May inspector general report from the State Department, the IG cited instances where hacking attempts were suspected as part of evidence that officials were aware of her email practices. The IG said that in January 2011, a Clinton technical adviser notified her deputy chief of staff for operations that he shut down the server ”because he believed ’someone was trying to hack us and while they did not get in i didnt [sic] want to let them have the chance to. ’” He shut the server again down later in the day because of another attack attempt. The next day, the deputy chief of staff emailed officials above him to not email Clinton ”anything sensitive” and that he would explain ”in person.” In May 2011, Clinton’s staff discussed via email her receiving a suspicious link to her email, and she later that day replied to a message from the account of the undersecretary for political affairs with a suspicious website link in it, ”Is this really from you?” The IG dinged Clinton and her staff for not reporting the incidents. In none of the accounts, though, was there a record of the attempts being successful, nor indication of who was behind it. The BBC also reported last year that there was other evidence of hacking attempts in the emails that were released by the State Department. Five   ”phishing” emails were sent to Clinton’s email that contained malicious software disguised as speeding tickets. If someone had opened the malware, data would have been transmitted overseas, including one based in Russia. But again, there was no evidence the phishing attempts were ever opened. There have also been boastful claims by a hacker that he broke into Clinton’s server    with no evidence to back it up. Recently convicted Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar, who pleaded guilty to hacking email accounts belonging to figures including former Presidents George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush and Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal, made such a claim from prison in an interview with NBC News. Verdict: Because there is no conclusive indication that Clinton’s email was ever breached, let alone proof that foreign governments were behind even such attempts, we rate Trump’s claim as false. Reality Check: Trump says Clinton money for refugees could rebuild every inner city in America, By Sonam Vashi and John Newsome, CNN, Trump said, ”Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration. For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.” First: how much do we spend on refugees, and how much more does Clinton want to spend? In fiscal year 2015, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) which is under the Department of Health and Human Services, had about 1. 6 billion to spend on services such as medical assistance, employment services, and English language training, among others. More than half of the ORR’s budget, or about $950 million, goes to temporary custody and care of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children, who are almost all from Central America and Mexico. In fiscal year 2015, the State Department spent about $3 billion on Migration and Refugee Assistance, and it spent $50 million on Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. On CBS News’ ”Face the Nation” last September, Clinton was asked if the current U. S. plan to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees to 10, 000 was enough. She replied, ”I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10, 000 to 65, 000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.” There’s no clean or accurate way to estimate how much each refugee costs the U. S. For an overly simplistic estimate: if we look at the part of ORR’s budget that is not dedicated to the custody of Central American children (about $611 million in FY2015) the total number of refugees admitted (about 70, 000) and then add in the 55, 000 more Syrian refugees Clinton is proposing, the cost to the U. S. government might look something closer to $1. 1 billion per year (about $500 million more than what ORR spends now) plus the $3 billion per year from the State Department.  That $4. 1 billion doesn’t include resettlement services funded by the private sector NGOs like the International Rescue Committee, which helps resettle refugees in the U. S. are heavily funded by private donations. It also doesn’t include the positive economic impact refugees have on their communities once resettled, according to studies. Meanwhile, the amount of money required, both from public and private sources, to revitalize all of America’s   is so massive it is hard to quantify. The Initiative for a Competitive Inner City organization, a   incubator and accelerator for   growth, calls such an undertaking enormous. ”We cannot put a price tag on the vast   public and private investment required to revitalize America’s inner cities. We know that there are at least 328 inner cities in the United States with high levels of poverty and unemployment. They demand enormous public and private resources to deal with the profound challenge of economic inequality that plagues our cities,” the group’s CEO, Steve Grossman, tells CNN. Given how massive the price tag would be to revitalize all of America’s inner cities, it’s clear that it would be much larger than the approximate $4. 1 billion per year that the U. S. spends on refugees. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Trump on George Washington and protectionism, By Amy Gallagher, CNN, Trump said one of the first significant bills that former President George Washington signed was for the protection of American manufacturers. This is true. The Tariff of 1789 was one of the first major pieces of legislation to be signed into law and it placed a tariff on most imported goods in part to secure income for the new nation and in part to protect the fledgling manufacturing industry.  It is worth noting that there is some debate as to which was the primary purpose, protectionism or revenue, with most scholars believe the pressing need to pay off the debts of the Revolutionary War was the driving concern. While it was one of the first bills that Washington signed, it was not without some controversy at the time.  In particular, southern states objected to the tariffs that benefited northern manufacturers at the expense of southern agricultural interests. For example, a later tariff on   cloth both reduced the demand for American cotton as a raw material and increased the cost of imported cloth, hitting southern cotton farmers twice. It was this tension between agriculture and manufacturing that kept tariffs low for many years. The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that supports free trade, argues that protectionism is a failed policy and that the economic growth during the nation’s first decade was not because of but in spite of protectionist policies. The institute contends that most of the economic growth of the new nation came from western expansion, immigration, transportation, farming, mining and construction of infrastructure.  Verdict: True.</td>\n",

       "        <td>The Donald Trump Cabinet Tracker</td>\n",
       "        <td>Updated on January 6, 2017, Billionaire’s Row. All the President’s Generals. The Congressional Cabinet.   Donald Trump has assembled a    that has plenty of money, plenty of military expertise, and plenty of time in politics —  but not much experience in the sprawling federal departments they have been tapped to run. Trump has, thus far, chosen five wealthy business leaders, two generals, and four Republican politicians for his Cabinet. All but two are white, all but two are men, and just one —  Elaine Chao —  has run a federal agency before. Now they all must navigate the gauntlet of the U. S. Senate, where a slim Republican majority and an aggressive Democratic opposition will determine whether they get the jobs for which they’ve been nominated. The Senate hasn’t formally rejected a Cabinet pick since it voted down President George H. W. Bush’s nomination of John Tower for defense secretary in 1989. But no new president has gotten all of their nominees confirmed in the last 30 years those that become enmeshed in controversy or partisan brinkmanship (it’s often both) usually withdraw before a vote. Trump may have more luck with the Senate than his immediate predecessors, and he has Democrats to thank. When they held the majority in 2013, they changed the rules so that   nominations are no longer subject to the   threshold for filibusters. That means Trump could conceivably win Senate approval of his entire Cabinet without a single Democratic vote. But even without the filibuster threat, Republicans have just a   majority, and three GOP defectors could join unified Democrats in thwarting a nominee. The confirmation process begins in earnest this week, as seven of Trump’s top nominees are scheduled to testify in Senate hearings. They include two of the most important Cabinet posts: Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, and Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for secretary of state. The mere scheduling of hearings has sparked a fight between the parties. Democrats are accusing Republicans of trying to rush Trump’s Cabinet into office without proper vetting, particularly in the case of the wealthy executives who have slim public records and a greater potential for conflicts of interest. Just three of the nominees have completed financial disclosure forms and signed ethics agreements —  traditionally a prerequisite for confirmation hearings. Democrats are also upset that Republicans have scheduled six hearings for a single day, Wednesday they believe it’s an attempt to dilute media coverage of the hearings and make it easier for the nominees to avoid a major controversy. Late last week, the Office of Government Ethics said in a letter to senators that the Republican hearing schedule was “of great concern” and was causing “undue pressure” for the relatively small federal agency responsible for processing presidential appointees and nominees. Walter Schaub, director of the OGE, warned that the Senate would be breaking longstanding precedent by scheduling hearings nominees before some had signed financial disclosure forms and signed ethics agreements. “I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before thenominee had completed the ethics review process,” Schaub wrote. Check back here throughout January and February as we update each Cabinet pick through confirmation hearings, committee consideration, and ultimately the final votes on the Senate floor. Department of State, Trump’s pick: Rex Tillerson, Background: He’s an oil executive. Tillerson has been the CEO of Exxon Mobil for the last decade after working his way up the ranks since 1975. It’s the only company Tillerson has ever known the Texas native started at Exxon after graduating college. He’s also an Eagle Scout who served as a past president of the Boy Scouts of America. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: He’s a   businessman who makes big deals —  including with the same foreign governments with whom he’ll have to engage as secretary of state. “The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments,” Trump tweeted. Liabilities: Tillerson’s ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin will be the biggest potential obstacle to his confirmation by the Senate. In 2012, Putin awarded him the “Order of Friendship” —  a high honor in the Kremlin, but one that will not sit well with Russia hawks in Congress. Chances at Senate confirmation: Dicey. A number of Senate Republicans are worried about Tillerson’s coziness with Putin, including Marco Rubio, John McCain, and Chuck Grassley. Rubio said he was “seriously concerned” about Tillerson, and he is significant as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee that will hold the first vote on his nomination. With Democrats expected to oppose Tillerson en masse, the opposition of just three Republicans could sink his nomination. He benefits from the support of the Republican leadership, and endorsements from Condoleezza Rice, Robert Gates and James Baker. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 11 before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Department of the Treasury, Trump’s pick: Steven Mnuchin, Background: He’s a banker. Specifically, Mnuchin is a former senior executive at Goldman Sachs and a hedge fund manager who bought the failed mortgage lender IndyMac from the government in 2009. He spun it off into OneWest and sold it for a huge profit five years later. Mnuchin is also a Hollywood producer whose credits include Avatar, American Sniper, and the   movies. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: Spot the pattern yet? He’s a successful businessman. But perhaps equally as important, Mnuchin was a relatively early convert to the Trump cause and joined the campaign as national finance chairman back in April, just as the Republican was shifting from relying on his own funds to setting up a more traditional fundraising apparatus. Mnuchin made clear early on he wanted the Treasury job, and Trump rewarded him. Liabilities: Goldman Sachs and foreclosures. Economic populists will see Mnuchin’s nomination by a candidate who ran against Wall Street and the “rigged” system as the ultimate betrayal. If Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for the speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs, how can he turn around and pick a man who got rich there for treasury secretary? Moreover, while Trump hailed Mnuchin for his business savvy in making a boatload off IndyMac at the depth of the Great Recession, Democrats will savage him for the foreclosures that resulted and highlight stories like that of an    widow who blamed hounding by the bank for her husband’s death. Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. This is a fight Democrats are eager to have, since it buttresses their early critique of Trump as a con artist who ran on populism but plans to govern by oligarchy. Yet Senate Republicans are by and large a   bunch, and it’s not clear that Mnuchin’s critics can persuade three or more GOP senators to join them in opposition. Those to watch include Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Dean Heller of Nevada, who sits on the Finance Committee and is up for reelection in 2018. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Defense, Trump’s pick: General James Mattis, Background: Mattis is a   Marine Corps general who led U. S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013. He commanded forces in both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars after the   terrorist attacks. Mattis also worked with General David Petraeus to produce the field manual on battling counterinsurgents in Iraq. Government experience:   years in the military, though none in civilian posts. Why Trump likes him: For a guy who once said he probably knows “more about ISIS than the generals do,” he certainly likes hiring them for top positions. Mattis is known as a   and a voracious reader, and Trump has gushed that he is “the closest thing to George Patton that we have. ” Like Trump, Mattis is someone whose blunt talk occasionally crashes through the line of political correctness, and he has criticized the Obama administration stance toward Iran and its strategy across the Middle East. Trump seems to value his opinion: He told The New York Times that he was “impressed” when Mattis pointedly told him that torture does not work, though it did not change the  ’s support for the practice. Trump also seems fond of his nickname, Mad Dog. Liabilities: Mattis’s more colorful,   quotes may get some attention at his confirmation hearings, including this piece of advice he gave to Marines under his command in Iraq: “Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everyone you meet. ” But they don’t come close to the kinds of things Trump has said, and he won a presidential election. The bigger issue for Mattis is likely to be concerns over the tradition of civilian control of the military and having a retired general lead the Defense Department for the first time in 65 years. Chances at Senate confirmation: Good. They would be even higher but for the fact that unlike any other Trump Cabinet pick, Mattis will need to clear a higher hurdle in Congress. That’s because both the House and Senate must pass legislation granting him a waiver to head the Pentagon, since the law forbids military officers from holding the position of defense secretary within seven years of their retirement. Unlike normal nominations, that legislation would be subject to the   filibuster threshold in the Senate. But although some Democrats are likely to oppose that bill, the party as a whole is unlikely to try and block Mattis from being confirmed. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Justice, Trump’s pick: Senator Jeff Sessions, Background: Sessions has represented Alabama in the Senate for 20 years, building up a record as a staunch critic of illegal immigration and expanded legal immigration. He’s been a conservative all around, opposing the Obama administration at nearly every turn. Before his election to the Senate, Sessions served as a federal prosecutor and then Alabama attorney general. He might have had a lifetime appointment to the federal bench had the Senate not rejected his nomination in 1987 over allegations that he made racist comments and praised the KKK while criticizing the NAACP and the ACLU. Government experience: Extensive. He served in the U. S. Senate since 1997 and held public office in Alabama beginning in 1981. Why Trump likes him: Loyalty. In February, Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trump’s candidacy, and he has been a surrogate and close adviser ever since. Sessions’s top aides are working in the Trump transition and at least one, policy adviser Stephen Miller, might snag a senior post in the West Wing. Sessions has made his name opposing comprehensive immigration reform and citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and Trump adopted similar positions that helped vault him to the top of the GOP primary field. Liabilities: The same comments that derailed Sessions’s nomination for a federal judgeship in the 1980s are likely to be    at his confirmation hearings, as will the staunchly conservative record he has amassed in the Senate. In his 1986 hearing before the Senate, Adam Serwer wrote for The Atlantic, “witnesses testified that Sessions referred to a black attorney as ‘boy,’ described the Voting Rights Act as ‘intrusive,’ attacked the NAACP and ACLU as ‘ ’ for ‘forcing civil rights down the throats of people,’ joked that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was ok until he found out they smoked marijuana, and referred to a white attorney who took on   cases as a  ‘traitor to his race. ’” Sessions will face scrutiny over how he intends to enforce   and   laws as attorney general. Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. Most if not all Democrats will oppose Sessions based on his record on civil rights and immigration, and his nomination might have been untenable were he not a sitting senator. But the Senate is a political country club, and members rarely reject one of their own. So while some Republicans will face pressure to oppose him and Democrats will subject him to intense questioning at his confirmation hearings in January, Sessions is likely to win approval unless newer damaging comments emerge in the next few weeks. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 10 and 11 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Department of Homeland Security, Trump’s pick: Retired General John Kelly, Background: The military. Like Mattis, Kelly is a veteran of more than 40 years in the Marine Corps, having served as commander of the U. S. Southern Command for the final three ending in January. The jurisdiction included South and Central America, as well as the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Kelly also has the sad distinction of being the   military officer to lose a child in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, was killed after stepping on a land mine in Afghanistan in 2010. Government experience: Four decades in the military, including assignments as a liaison to Congress. Why Trump likes him: Aside from being a general, Kelly’s deep knowledge of border security and the challenges posed by illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America are likely the reason Trump selected him. He has warned about the danger of terrorists using known drug smuggling routes to send operatives to the United States through Mexico, which was a theme for Trump on the campaign trail. Liabilities: Kelly’s military background will draw concerns from those who oppose Trump’s move to populate his Cabinet with generals. But he enters the confirmation process with no obvious red flags that could sink his nomination. Chances at Senate confirmation: Excellent. Democrats are picking their battles against Trump nominees, and they aren’t signaling a major fight against Kelly. For the most part, they are relieved that Trump didn’t pick either Kris Kobach, the   secretary of state of Kansas, or David Clarke Jr. the outspoken sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Democrats might also be saving their fire in case Trump nominates either of them for a deputy post at DHS. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 10 before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, Department of Health and Human Services, Trump’s pick: Representative Tom Price, Background: The deeply conservative,   Georgia congressman is chairman of the House Budget Committee, a leading critic of the Affordable Care Act, and an architect of Republican proposals to replace the health law. Before entering politics in the 1990s, Price was an orthopedist for 20 years in Atlanta. Government experience: Twelve years in Congress and another eight in the Georgia state Senate before that. Why Trump likes him: The two men don’t have much of a personal history, but Price is a close ally both of Vice   Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan from their years together as conservatives in Congress. Price will be instrumental in working with Republicans on Capitol Hill to devise and pass a replacement for Obamacare. In the meantime, Price’s experience in federal health policy could allow him to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act from the inside at HHS. Liabilities: Medicare, Medicare, Medicare. The biggest obstacle to Price’s confirmation is not his fervent opposition to Obamacare but his support for Ryan’s longstanding desire to convert Medicare into a voucher program. Democrats will do their best to make his confirmation hearings a referendum on this plan, particularly since Ryan has said he wants to try to pass it at some point during Trump’s first term. Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. Price’s ideological conservatism and his support for overhauling healthcare entitlement programs mean he is likely to gain very little, if any, support from Democrats. Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia will be ones to watch. But Price is   personally, and his relationships with Republican lawmakers as a veteran member of the House make his confirmation chances better than even. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Trump’s pick: Dr. Ben Carson, Background: The conservative former Trump rival for the Republican presidential nomination has no formal experience in housing policy. He’s a retired neurosurgeon renowned for pioneering a procedure to separate conjoined twins. But what Carson would bring to HUD is the personal experience of having grown up poor in Detroit. He has written and spoken extensively about his upbringing, saying that his hard work and passion for reading, along with the firm encouragement of his single mother, helped him to escape the poverty of the inner city. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: Again, loyalty. Carson endorsed Trump after he dropped out of the presidential race, and though he wasn’t his most effective surrogate, he stayed with him through the ups and downs of the general election. Trump lambasted him during the primary, mocking his childhood struggle with what Trump described as “a pathological temper. ” The two have long since patched things up, however. Carson was pegged for a Cabinet post early on, but it figured to be the Department of Health and Human Services, given his deep experience in medicine. Trump and Carson do appear to share an     philosophy toward combatting poverty, where government programs play a smaller role than they do now. Liabilities: Experience, or lack thereof. Carson’s most formidable challenge may be explaining his own assessment of his qualifications to lead a Cabinet department, as explained by his spokesman, Armstrong Williams, to The Hill shortly after the election: “Dr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he’s never run a federal agency. The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency. ” Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. Republicans may be predisposed to support Carson, but how he addresses this issue at his confirmation hearings could be crucial to his chances of Senate approval. Democrats are likely to challenge him both on his lack of experience in housing policy and his specific vision for running the agency and combatting poverty. They will also force him to address the sharp criticism Trump has levied at the state of urban America and his misstatements about the crime rate nationwide. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 12 before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Department of Energy, Trump’s pick: Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Background: Perry served     terms as the governor of Texas, succeeding George W. Bush after he became president. He then ran for president twice, failing to win the Republican nomination in 2012 and then again in 2016. His experience in   Texas would, on the surface, seem to make him a natural fit, but the Energy Department is actually more of a national security agency that’s responsible for designing and protecting the nation’s stockpile of nuclear weapons. The last two energy secretaries were   scientists. Government experience:     terms as governor of Texas, a short stint as lieutenant governor, and eight years as Texas agriculture commissioner. Why Trump likes him: Perry is another example of a Republican who fought bitterly with Trump only to make amends. Early in the 2016 race, Perry was actually more confrontational with Trump than any other Republican. He gave an entire speech devoted to attacking him in July 2015, during which he said Trump was “a cancer on conservatism. ” But Perry was out of the race a few months later, and he came around to Trump once he secured the nomination and campaigned for his election. Liabilities: “Oops. ” As Democrats will undoubtedly remind the public to no end, the Energy Department was the Cabinet post that Perry infamously forgot he wanted to eliminate during a Republican primary debate in 2011. The mocking, however, will quickly turn serious as senators force Perry to explain how he plans to lead a department that he doesn’t believe should exist. As with a few other Trump nominees, expect to hear the words “fox in the henhouse” more than a few times. Chances at Senate confirmation: Very good. The “oops” moment will cause Perry some embarrassment, but barring another   gaffe, it’s hard to see it blocking his confirmation. He should win strong support from Republicans and even a few   Democrats looking for a bipartisan vote. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Labor, Trump’s pick: Andrew Puzder, Background: Puzder is best known as the chief executive of the parent company for Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. the   chains. He worked his way up in the business world originally as a lawyer and general counsel, the position he first held at CKE Restaurants. He’s also a frequent conservative commentator and a critic of   laws and the Obama administration’s overtime rule. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: He’s been a ”vocal defender of Trump’s economic policies,” and shares a rhetorical style with the  . As brash businessmen, they seem like two peas in a pod. Under Puzder’s leadership, Carl’s Jr. has relied on   ads featuring women eating burgers in swimsuits. “I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it’s very American,” he told Entrepreneur last year. Liabilities: Puzder’s confirmation will be a rough ride for a number of reasons. On policy, his opposition to a   increase will be a target for Democrats, who will argue that placing a wealthy executive atop the Labor Department is an insult to   voters who supported Trump. And his   comments about women could pose problems, along with reports that he repeatedly abused his wife during the 1980s. (The   Lisa Fierstein, has since said she regretted making the allegations in their divorce proceedings and said, according to New York Magazine, that Puzder is “a wonderful father, a great person, and was a good husband. ”) Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. Expect Democrats to put up a big fight against Puzder over his position on the minimum wage and overtime pay as well as his lack of government experience. Portraying him as an    multimillionaire will dovetail with their critique of several of Trump’s Cabinet picks and the broader message they want to send to   voters. So far, however, Republicans have yet to break away, so Puzder’s nomination is not in jeopardy. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Transportation, Trump’s pick: Elaine Chao, Background: As labor secretary for the full two terms of the George W. Bush administration, Chao brings more civilian experience in the federal government than anyone else in Trump’s Cabinet. Before that, she directed the Peace Corps and led United Way. During the first Bush administration, Chao also served as a deputy secretary in the department she is poised to lead. Government experience: Extensive: see above. Why Trump likes her: While Trump surely appreciated Chao’s deep experience in government and Washington, there is probably another factor in his decision to nominate her for transportation secretary: Chao is married to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a man who will hold wide sway over whether Trump’s agenda makes it into law. In particular, she’ll be a key player in Trump’s push for an expensive infrastructure package that McConnell and his conservative allies are cool to. Liabilities: Virtually none. Given her government experience and obvious qualifications for the post, Chao might be the least controversial of any of Trump’s choices so far. Her selection even won praise from Vice President Joe Biden. Chances at Senate confirmation: What is better than excellent? It would take a scandal of seismic proportions for the clearly qualified wife of the Republican majority leader not to win confirmation by the Senate. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 11 before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Department of Education, Trump’s pick: Betsy DeVos, Background: DeVos is a longtime philanthropist and Republican donor and the former chairwoman of the state party in Michigan. She’s been a major advocate for education reform centered on expanding charter schools and   vouchers. She led the advocacy group, American Federation for Children, that pushes for increased school choice for parents. The New York Times reported on her successful effort to kill legislation in Detroit that would have imposed tougher accountability standards on charter schools. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes her: Trump has shown that he favors plucking people from the private sector who will come in and shake up a government agency, and DeVos fits that bill. She has strong support among Republican school reformers, especially those who favor both expanding charter schools and vouchers. (Democrats favor the former but not the latter.) She is further to the right on education than two other women Trump interviewed: Eva Moskowitz, a charter school leader in New York, and Michelle Rhee, the former chancellor of the Washington D. C. public schools. Liabilities: Teacher unions will aggressively oppose DeVos over her support for unfettered and largely unregulated expansion of charter schools and vouchers. That likely won’t matter much to Republicans, but it will hurt her chances of winning broad bipartisan support. Conservatives who favor reduced federal power over education will question her previous support for Common Core standards and her affiliation with organizations that have championed Common Core. Anticipating that issue, DeVos has said that while she supports “high standards and strong accountability” for schools, Common Core “got turned into a federalized boondoggle. ” Chances at Senate confirmation: Very good. Key Republicans have already come out in support of DeVos, including the chairman of the relevant committee in the Senate, Lamar Alexander. Most Democrats will likely oppose the pick, but barring a controversy that erupts during her confirmation hearings, she should win approval. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 11 before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Department of the Interior, Trump’s pick: Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, Background: Zinke is a Republican member of the House who was just reelected to his second term in November. He had been expected to run for the Senate in 2018, but at least for now, he’s headed for Trump’s Cabinet. Zinke served for more than 20 years in the Navy Seals before entering politics, earning numerous medals. In Congress, he has opposed the sale of federal lands but supported mining and drilling on them. Government experience: Two decades in the military and two years in Congress. Why Trump likes him: Trump was, not surprisingly, impressed with Zinke’s military background, and the congressman reportedly impressed Trump’s son Donald Jr. an avid sportsman who was influenced by the recommendation of the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. Liabilities: Environmentalists immediately denounced the Zinke nomination, citing his support for mining and drilling and his skepticism about climate change. And a recent report in The Intercept alleged that he committed “travel fraud” while serving in the Navy   unit SEAL Team 6. But there were no other immediate obstacles to his confirmation. Chances at Senate confirmation: Excellent. Many Democrats will oppose Zinke over his environmental record, but don’t expect a major fight over his confirmation. The party has a political reason for letting him go through: Serving in Trump’s Cabinet may remove him as a threat to challenge Senator Jon Tester in 2018. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Commerce, Trump’s pick: Wilbur Ross, Background: Another billionaire, Ross is the chairman of a private equity firm that he founded and later sold. For 25 years, he led Rothschild Inc. where he made a reputation as a turnaround specialist who bought up and restructured steel, textile, and mining companies, among other industries. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: The two businessmen go back many years together and share a critical view of U. S. trade policy in the last two decades. Ross, who specialized in turning around manufacturing firms, served as an adviser to Trump during the campaign. Ross, the   said in nominating him, “is a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed. Most importantly, he is one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met, and that comes from me, the author of The Art of the Deal. ” Liabilities: Yes, Ross may have turned around companies, but at what cost to workers? He will get the Mitt Romney treatment from Democrats, who are portraying him as an    plutocrat who outsourced jobs and slashed benefits at the companies he restructured. He’ll also face questions over the 2006 explosion at a mine run by one of his companies, which killed 12 workers. Chances at Senate confirmation: Very good. Expect Democrats to paint Mnuchin and Ross with the same brush, but the bigger fight will probably occur over the bigger job, treasury secretary.

       "        <td>Welcome to Breitbart News’s live updates of the 2016 horse race.   —   All times eastern. 10:03: Trump says he thinks he will get to 1, 237 delegates. He says he will do really well in New York and California and says “this has been an amazing process. ” He says he is spending his own money and politicians won’t do the right things for the American people because they are motivated by special interests and lobbyists. Trump says politicians are not stupid when they make bad deals that hurt Americans —  he says they are just doing what their donors want them to do. He says the country has been great to him and he wants to give back. 10:00: Trump says political life is “more dishonest” than pretty dishonest business people. But he says business people are “tougher” than politicians. And he says he will use some of the tough people to negotiate trade deals. 9:58: Trump says the key to success is to love what you are doing and never give up. 9:55: Trump tells questioner that his brother was a phenomenally handsome guy and he started drinking and it became a real problem. He says he always told him never to drink and smoke. Trump says his brother was one of his truly great teachers because he always said “don’t ever drink. ” Trump says he owns the largest winery in the east coast but he has never had a drink. Trump says when his children were growing up, he would always tell his kids “no alcohol, no drugs, no cigarettes. ” Trump says it’s a tough world to begin with but if you add alcohol or drugs, then it becomes really tough. Trump says if parents can keep their children away from alcohol or drugs, it’ll make life a lot easier. Ivanka and Don Jr. says that every morning their dad told them “no alcohol, no drugs, no cigarettes. ” 9:53: Don Jr. says he finds it funny when politicians say they are serving the people when they are serving themselves. He says Trump’s campaign is resonating because he will serve the people. 9:48: Ivanka says converting to Judaism is “such a personal decision” that she doesn’t want to talk about it in a public forum. She says her dad was very supportive and points out that she doesn’t rush into things and appreciates the support that he gave him. She said it would have been much more hard if there had been headwinds. 9:41: Trump says he has picked up more than 100, 000 followers over the weekend and he says social media is really an asset and enjoys doing it. He says “it is a powerful thing” and there is genius going on there. He would Tweet very limitedly as president, Trump says. But he says that social media allows him to criticize his opponents directly and it can break into all of the networks and drive the news cycle. He says “it is a modern method of communication. ” Trump says the number of followers he has gives him a big advantage over other candidates. Trump says during the day, he shouts out stuff to his staff and they will sometimes Tweet what he wants. Trump says he himself always Tweets at night. 9:39: Melania says Barron is not on social media but has an iPhone. She points out that she grew up without social media and it was a lot better because she sees a lot of bullying going on on social media. Anderson asks Trump’s children if they monitor their dad’s social media. Laughter ensures. Eric says his dad is “so authentic” and doesn’t have a team writing his Tweets. 9:33: Questioner points out that the media have gone after Trump on women’s issues. Ivanka says that Trump has put female role models in top positions in an industry still dominated by men. She says Trump always taught her that there wasn’t anything she couldn’t do if she had deep passion and worked hard to achieve it. She says that is not a message a father would relay to a daughter who they didn’t think could accomplish the same things as her brothers. Ivanka says a lot of politicians talk the talk on gender issues but points out that Trump’s actions speak louder than words. Melania says Trump treats everyone equally, 9:32: Questioner wonders if the campaign has put a strain on Ivanka’s friendship with Chelsea Clinton. “We’re children and we love our parents,” she says, adding that that is the “great equalizer. ” She says Chelsea would probably say the same thing about her mother. 9:30: Ivanka says it’s easy to tell her dad to be nice but points out that that is easy to say when you are not in the arena. She says the debates have been like cage matches because Trump has been the frontrunner throughout the election cycle. 9:28: Questioner wonders if Trump talks to his wife and children in the same way he speaks at the GOP debates. Trump says he is much nicer to them. Trump says it has been an “interesting process” and says his family keeps  urging him to be nicer in the debates. Trump says he can’t when he is being attacked from all angles. Trump says he has to win first before he can be nice. 9:27: Tiffany Trump says her dad’s work ethic inspires her the most. 9:25: Eric Trump says he and his dad bond over   and golf. He says his dad is his best friend in the whole world. Trump says his relationship with his dad became a lot better after he graduated college. Trump says he wanted to be a baseball player and make movies but decided that real estate was the “right thing to do. ” 9:23: First questioner asks Melania Trump if Barron is being raised differently than the other children. She says times are different. Melania says Trump is always on the road and she is staying at home raising him. Cooper wonders if Trump is a different dad to Barron, and he says he may appreciate it more. Trump says many people have said that his children have done a good job and they better keep doing a good job. Trump says he is honored that a lot of parents whose kids have various problems have asked him to talk to them. 9:20: Ivanka says she is an independent and their family is not a family of politicians. She said New York’s rules required them to register almost a year ago and they found out after the fact. She says that is why she started to make a series of videos informing people in various states because the rules can be “onerous. ” Eric Trump says it was a “great educational process for us” and it motivated them to inform more people about the voting rules in the states. 9:19: Trump’s son Don Jr. says he may have made the decision to run this year because his kids are older and can manage his companies. He points out that Trump employs thousands of people and needs his companies to succeed to keep them employed. 9:18: Trump’s family joins him on stage. Ivanka says politics is a “vicious” industry —  much more so than real estate. 9:13: “You don’t need two like me,” Trump says when asked what he is looking for in a potential vice president. He says he will select someone who will work with Congress. 9:12: Trump says he is giving around 10 policy speeches and will give one on unity. He will give a speech on the military and NATO. 9:10: Trump says Cruz has left town after not being received well in New  York and doesn’t think he will come back. Trump says the states that know him well like Florida are the ones where he performs the best. 9:09: Trump says a   run is something he really doesn’t want to do. 9:07: Cooper wonders how Trump can tout his management skills when he has had such a weak ground game. Trump cites victories in South Carolina, New Hampshire, and “the entire South. ” 9:06: Trump says he thinks the RNC doesn’t want him to get the nomination. But he is not sure if it is actively working against him. 9:04: Cooper says Trump could have had a better organization on the ground, but Trump says he doesn’t think it would matter. 9:02: When Cooper asks Trump if he just got outplayed on the ground in Colorado, Trump says he doesn’t think so and says he is millions of votes ahead of Cruz. He says Colorado and Louisiana were “unfair” because of all of the “shenanigans. ” Cooper presses Trump that these are the rules and he should  have known them. Trump says the rules are stacked against him. 8:55: Donald Trump and his family are getting ready to participate in CNN’s live town hall event. 7:05: Heidi Cruz tells Megyn Kelly that Trump’s Tweets didn’t impact her in the least. “Well, one great thing about me, Megyn, is that I don’t tweet. So I had an ability to completely ignore it. I think we have a pattern of behavior here that when Donald Trump is falling behind. You know it’s interesting, the timing of that was right before Ted’s sweep, sweeping victory in Utah   …     But I will tell you I know why we are running this race and it’s not for Donald Trump  —   it is for the voters of this country and when you have a husband who is standing by you that is so strong and so unflappable it really gives me a lot of strength. So I really have to honestly say it didn’t impact me in the least. 6:50: Sanders visits Hyde Park: . @BernieSanders pays respects at FDR’s grave site  …     Talks about the WWII president taking on elite biz class pic. twitter.   —   MaryAlice Parks (@maryaliceparks) April 12, 2016,  5:25: Trump says the rules are no good when they don’t count your vote and you have to engage in dirty tricks to pick up delegates. 5:33: Dem. Party “error” in Colorado costs Sanders a delegate. Sanders campaign kept in dark: Bernie Sanders won one more delegate in Colorado than first projected after the Colorado Democratic Party admitted this week that it misreported the March 1 caucus results from 10 precinct locations. The party discovered the discrepancy a week after the caucus but did not correct the public record. Hillary Clinton’s campaign discussed the error with state party officials last week, but the Sanders campaign apparently didn’t realize the issue until being informed Monday evening by The Denver Post. 5:22: Trump, talking about Clinton’s defense of Obama’s legacy, says nobody is going to vote for an Obama third term because he’s been a “disaster. ” 5:20: Trump says his numbers right now are better than Reagan’s were at this point against Jimmy Carter. He says the last person Hillary wants to run against is him. 5:18:   national poll: Sanders, Clinton tied. Trump ahead of Cruz by six points ( ). 5:14: Trump says Jordan Spieth choked a little bit but he’s going to recover because he’s a great golfer. But Trump says Romney wasn’t able to recover and can’t after “choking like a dog” against Obama. 5:10: Trump now blasts Clinton on her cattle futures deal. He says Clinton is probably being protected and notes that  people who did five percent of what she did have had their lives destroyed. 5:09: Trump says he and Sanders agree on rigged trade deals but Trump can make deals that Sanders won’t be able to negotiate. 5:07: Trump says the RNC should be “ashamed of itself  …     for allowing this crap to happen” in Colorado because it has “nothing to do with democracy. ” 5:05: Trump blasts the “rigged system” and says the establishment hates it that he  is   his campaign. “I’m working for you,” he says. 5:01: Trump says the Utica region has lost more than half of its manufacturing jobs since 1990. “What the hell is going on?” Trump asks. “We’re going to bring it back. ” He says New York state has lost three out of every four manufacturing jobs that existed since 1960. 5:00: In New York, Trump says there is a movement going on and it’s happening all over the country. He starts his speech by focusing on trade and negotiators who have no idea that they’re doing. He says “we’re going to turn it around and we’re going to turn it around quickly. ” 4:45: The Observer, which is published by Trump’s    endorses Trump: Donald Trump is the    of the Observer’s publisher. That is not a reason to endorse him. Giving millions of disillusioned Americans a renewed sense of purpose and opportunity is. Explaining the phenomenon that is propelling the Trump candidacy is easy, despite the nattering of the cognoscenti —  the media elite, the professional political class and the people largely insulated or directly benefitting from the failures of the last seven years. Their opinions have become increasingly irrelevant. For in the 10 months since Mr. Trump’s campaign announcement, their “insights” have been uniformly wrong and their influence has dwindled. The media and cultural elite’s inability to grasp the profound alienation, anger and disillusionment of millions of Americans has fueled Mr. Trump’s popularity. The media’s enthusiastic embrace of the Obama narrative —  that America should be willing to accept a dimmer future —  has blinded it to the appeal of the Trump candidacy, and of an alternative, more compelling narrative. 3:28: Ryan says he would encourage delegates to put in a rule so that only those who ran for president can be nominated. 3:27: When asked what he will say to people who have said that Ryan issued the same denials before becoming House Speaker, Ryan says “apples and oranges. ” He says House Speaker is completely different from President of the United States. 3:25: Ryan also says that “not running does not mean I’m going to disappear. ” 3:24: “I do not want nor will I accept the nomination of our party,” he says. “Count me out. ” Ryan tells delegates that the nominee must be someone who actually ran for president and he should not be considered, “period. End of story. ” 3:20: At the RNC, Paul Ryan says he returned from a trip to the Middle East and it is amazing how closely the rest of the world is following our politics. “I want to put this to rest once and for all,” he says, addressing rumors that he may want the GOP nomination at a contested convention. 3:05: Sanders surrogate rips Clinton for opposing driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants. 3:00: Scene at RNC before Ryan’s speech: Campaign finance protestors appear to have gotten the memo that Paul Ryan is speaking at the RNC  —   crowd of them yelling outside the office.  —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) April 12, 2016,  Waiting for Ryan  …     pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) April 12, 2016,  2:40: Zuckerberg takes veiled shot at Trump, criticizes “fearful voices calling for building walls. ” “I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as others, for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, reducing trade and, in some cases around the world, even cutting access to the internet,” he reportedly said. 2:30: CSPAN provides a Paul Ryan flashback: ”I’m not old enough.” @SpeakerRyan responds to @cspanwj caller in 1998 on running for President.

He said Sanders has not encountered the level of scrutiny he will in New York, where “every day is primetime. ” Fallon said Sanders is “untested” and that is why New York Democrats will choose Clinton. 1:56: GOP donors giving Cruz a second look. 1:54: Clinton Library releases Trump documents: Pres.

       "        <td>Donald Trump won’t be president for another two months, and yet already he is scoring successes for American workers, as the deal to keep a thousand or more jobs at the Carrier Corporation reminds us.  [On November 30, a jubilant Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, tweeted out, “1000 Families will have a better Christmas  future because @realDonaldTrump cared enough to fight for them. ” And then he added this apt jibe: “Where was @BarackObama —  Useless. ”   The following day, December 1, the   visited the Carrier plant in Indianapolis.  In his visit, thronged by grateful workers, Trump took time to highlight the good news: that is, not only the jobs saved, but also the $16 million in new investment that Carrier will make —  which will, of course, ultimately create more jobs.  As Vice   Mike Pence said on Thursday, “Today America won and we have Donald Trump to thank. ” Of course, any success for Trump is a defeat for the MSM.  And so The New York Times struck back, packing such loaded phrases as “frenetic activity,” “impulsive gestures,” “compulsively theatrical,” and “headline grabbing” into one of its myriad of   stories.  For its part, The Washington Post was equally eager to undercut Trump’s triumph, suggesting that it was somehow   for Trump to roll up his sleeves and actually fight for American jobs evidently, the Post prefers President Barack Obama’s “what me worry?” attitude of aloof indifference.  Indeed, in June of this year, Obama, asked about the jobs that have gone overseas during his presidency, pronounced to an audience that “Those jobs of the past are just not going to come back. ”  Oh, but wait, there was one time when Obama personally tried to get something done for the American people: That was his 2009 trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to pitch Chicago as the site of the 2016 Olympics.  As we all remember, he failed in fact, Chicago was eliminated in the first round. As Hannity said of him, useless. Returning to the present day, the Post insinuated this nitpicking commentary on Trump’s   success into the fourth paragraph of its “news” story:  Experts said no modern president has intervened on behalf of an individual company, a move that amounts to the nation’s highest office choosing winners and losers in the economy. Conservatives have long decried such incentive packages as distorting free markets, while liberals have characterized them as corporate subsidies. For his part, Trump took time not only to rebut the quibbling, but also double down on his activism. That is, he promised to do it again if need be:  I think it’s very presidential . . . We’re going to have a lot of phone calls made to companies when they say they’re leaving this country because they’re not going to leave this country. To be sure, a few media outlets recognized Trump’s achievement: The New York Post headlined, “Donald Trump is already helping the working class,” adding:  Sure, it’s unusual for a   to interject himself in the economic mechanizations of a specific company —  let alone the economy writ large —  but everything about Trump being the next president is unusual. Yes, that’s a fair statement: Trump is unusual.  But he just won a presidential election, carrying 30 states and more than 300 electoral votes —  and in recent decades, that’s been decidedly unusual for a Republican.   Indeed, Trump can now be thought of as the opposite of a “lame duck” —  that being a politician, still in office, who has lost his mojo.  Instead, Trump has demonstrable clout even before taking the oath office.   In the meantime, it’s a safe bet that the average American is thinking to himself or herself: If it takes “unusual” to save my job and other Americans’ jobs, too, then please, let’s have more unusual!  So, even though his inauguration is nearly eight weeks away, we are learning more about how Trump will lead and govern as our 45th president.  Specifically, we can identify a quintet of key characteristics:  It’s all starting to add up to something big —  something that might soon be known as the Trump Deal.    Let’s look at each in turn:  1) Keeping promises, keeping in touch.  Immediately after the election, the   TransPacific Partnership, which Trump had vociferously denounced, was tossed out the window.  This defeat for “America Last” globalism came as a painful shock to Obama and also to his establishment Republican allies, such as Ohio Governor John Kasich, who visited the White House in September, as part of an obvious attempt to undercut Trump’s candidacy.  Indeed, Kasich has been doubly pained  in November, Trump carried the Buckeye State by more than eight points over Hillary Clinton.   Meanwhile, the   is on his   “Donald J. Trump USA Thank You Tour 2016,” emphasizing, yet again, that he is serious about keeping his campaign promises.   For example, as he said in Indiana, “Trust me, we are going to build that wall. ” At the same time, his   machine continues to churn, leaving the MSM to spin its wheels.  In a revealing November 29 Breitbart piece headlined, “Under the Hood: How Donald Trump Has Cut Around Corporate Media to Reach Millions Directly Online,” reporter Matthew Boyle summed up the efforts of Trump social media director Dan Scavino: During the campaign, Scavino oversaw an operation that generated 21 billion Facebook impressions, 1. 3 billion video views, and nearly 50 million “likes. ” Meanwhile, on Twitter, Trump’s posts, beaming out to 16. 2 million followers, enjoyed nearly nine billion impressions.  All in all, 36 million people were within his personal social media reach. Yet the heart of this   cornucopia was Trump himself.  As Scavino put it,  The success to our social media platforms comes directly from   and now   of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.  It is all Mr. Trump and his messaging. Whether Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram platforms, Mr. Trump is directly involved with our social media messaging.  He loves communicating with the American people, and he loves seeing what is going out. Which is to say, any curious American, fan or foe, can click on “All Trump, all the time. ”  Of course, Trump’s instant accessibility is bothersome to the MSM, which has enjoyed its “gatekeeper” function for so long.  To which millions of Americans might say, “Too bad!”  Indeed, some are even willing to take this   reality to the next level.  As Sean Hannity, a leading Trump ally, has boldly suggested, perhaps Trump doesn’t need the MSM at all anymore.  Hannity says of the press:  They lie.  They’re corrupt.  They’re dishonest. They collude.  They’re all in this hyperventilating mode about “fake news” now, but they are fake news.  That’s them.  It’s now on display for the world to see. Then the Fox man added this bombshell of a recommendation:  I suggested the other day that if any of these organizations were involved in collusion with the Clinton campaign, why do they get a seat in the White House press office?  Why does Donald Trump need a White House press office?  These are, indeed, provocative questions.  The rest of us can observe: If the MSM is relentlessly hostile, and if Trump can reach the American people without the MSM, then the logic of Hannity’s argument starts to come into focus.  2)   activist.  Already, since the election, the stock market is up, hiring is up, consumer confidence is up to the highest level in nearly a decade, surveys of Wall Street analysts show widespread optimism, and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development has raised its growth forecast for the US economy.   Still, it’s worth recalling that Trump isn’t even president he hasn’t had a chance, yet, to implement the promises he made at Gettysburg, PA on October 22, including, “lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion worth of   American energy reserves. ” That is, energy resources currently strangled by government red tape.  Yet even now, investors are factoring Trump’s   policies into their bullish projections.  We might note that Trump will not be the only     in his administration.  As Politico reported on November 30, Trump’s choice of Steven Mnuchin as the next treasury secretary comes with Mnuchin’s declaration that new investments in infrastructure will be a “high priority. ”   In addition, Mnuchin strongly praised Trump’s work to keep Carrier in Indiana, labeling it “terrific,” recalling,  The   and the vice   picked up the phone and called the CEO of the United Technologies and told them we want to keep jobs here.  Can’t remember the last time a president did that and this is going to be a terrific opportunity. Moreover, Mnuchin suggested that more such deals would be in the making.  To be sure, the Carrier deal is “only” 1000 jobs, in an economy that employs 124. 7 million.  So yes, of course, America not only needs better   it also needs better  .  And the   administration pledges just that: tax reduction and reform, deregulation, and more energy production, just for starters. As Trump said on December 1, his mission is to “reverse the stagnation and usher in a period of prosperity and growth. ”  Then he added: We’ll compete in the world, we want to compete in the world, but we’re going to compete in the world where it’s a   road, not a   road.  The advantages are going to come back to our country, and they haven’t for many, many years. And once again, political hope is on its way to becoming an   policy reality.  Here’s the   headline in The Washington Post: “Trump nominees map out plans for tax cuts, trade and   negotiations. ”  As Mnuchin also noted: It starts with an attitude of this administration.  This president, this vice   is going to have open communications with business leaders. Needless to say, Trump’s   for jobs and profits horrifies   ideologues and Trump haters.  Here, for example, is a tweet in response to the Carrier deal from Rep. Justin Amash ( ) a hardcore libertarian:  Not the  ’s job.  We live in a constitutional republic, not an autocracy.    meddling shouldn’t be normalized. And The Wall Street Journal editorial page —  long a hotbed of Never Trump globalism —  also chimed in with a critique.  Reading their words, an ordinary American might fairly conclude: These libertarian ideologues care more about their intellectual abstractions than    workers.  And we might further note that such intellectual abstractions have a funny way of always serving the interests of Wall Street globalists.  Meanwhile, many on the left also criticized the deal, including Binyamin Applebaum of The New York Times:    It is impossible to assess the merits of the Carrier deal until we know why the company changed its mind —  and at what cost to taxpayers. And Ralph Nader, too,  .   In addition,   Never Trumpers, such as Amanda Carpenter  —  now happily ensconced at CNN —  will never miss a chance to trash Trump, even when he saves US jobs. Yet even so, some   Democrats are climbing on board the Trump Express.  Here are the words of Virginia’s Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe, a longtime supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton:  Defense spending, infrastructure —  if we can work together on those things, we’re gonna have a good, healthy relationship.  The elections are over.  Politics is done.  Let’s get to work. One needn’t be fond of McAuliffe nonetheless to recognize this reality: When leaders work together on behalf of   projects, well, it’s more likely that jobs indeed will be created.  Indeed, one can see an emerging political model of, yes, Putting America First.  As Trump said on his trip, “Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences. ”  And that means that the breezy assumption —  so dominant during the Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama administrations —  that outsourcing and offshoring are inevitable, even desirable, is over.  In fact, across the country, it’s likely that vulnerable American workers are delighted: Finally, a president who remembers the Forgotten Man, and the Forgotten Woman.  3) Inclusive approach to governing.  Here we can start by recalling Trump’s selection of Mike Pence as his running mate Pence, of course, is not only from the heartland, but also straight from the heart of the GOP.  And there was the choice also of another insider, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, to be White House chief of staff.  Most recently, we can note Trump’s selection of Elaine Chao —  a presidential appointee in the last three Republican administrations —  as his secretary of transportation. (Chao, of course, is also the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.)  And then there’s the case of Mitt “Never Trump” Romney.  If Trump can forgive him, and even share a cozy meal, then obviously he has the capacity to forgive, and perhaps include, anyone.    Once again, not everyone will appreciate every last one of Trump’s personal, or personnel, choices.  But our purpose here is not to praise what Trump does but, rather, to inventory the early clues we are seeing about his governing style.  And mixing in GOP insiders is definitely a part of that style.  4) New spirit of common sense.  As George Orwell once put it, “The heresy of heresies is common sense. ”  As for Trump, his entire campaign has been about common sense, starting with such obvious goals as closing the border to terrorists, standing up for law and order, and rebuilding America’s infrastructure.    Indeed, the   evidence indicates that Trump’s approach is winning people over, despite the polarization and hard feelings of the last year.  And that seems to be a testament to the gut appeal of his commonsensical approach.    Of course, with Trump, a lot of it starts with Twitter.  And that’s wise, because as we know, the MSM hasn’t gotten any friendlier.   And so, operating outside of the MSM’s onetime monopoly, Trump has gotten to work.  On November 21, for example, he placed a condolence call to the family of slain San Antonio police officer Benjamin Marconi.  (Not only did Obama not call, but it’s a safe bet that nobody in the White House even thought to suggest it.)  More recently, Trump has taken up the issue of burning the American flag: He’s against it, and he thinks   should be punished.  Of course, the  ’s stance on basic patriotism has evoked much   among establishmentarians they declare that even the most odious   behavior is “protected free speech. ”   Yet what these   don’t say is that burning Old Glory has only been “protected speech” since a 1989 Supreme Court decision.  And as we all know, the Court can reverse itself at any time —  and perhaps a Trumpified SCOTUS will do just that.   In addition, Trump undoubtedly spoke for the vast majority of Americans when he tweeted out, in the wake of the latest incident of domestic terrorism, at Ohio State University on November 28, that the Somali refugee who committed the attack “should not have been in our country. ”  We can add: There aren’t enough NPR reporters in the country to talk the average American out of agreeing with Trump on that one.  As Trump said in Cincinnati  on December 1, our current immigration and asylum policies have been “stupidly created by our very stupid politicians. ”  And he further pledged, “We will suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed. ”  We can add that this   is especially urgent since the Obama administration is in the process of admitting thousands of potentially dangerous refugees that have been rejected by Australia.  That’s right: Under current policy, we are now taking an allied country’s rejects.  Now let’s look at another f’rinstance that illuminates how Trump thinks, on the one hand, and how the MSM thinks, on the other.  Here’s a  headline from the   magazine, The New Republic, on November 30: “What Will Happen to Chelsea Manning Under President Trump? Trump has threatened to review the military’s transgender policies, putting the whistleblower’s future at risk. ”   We all recall the case of Chelsea Manning, aka Bradley Manning, the Army soldier who leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents in 2010.  Manning was prosecuted under the Espionage Act and sentenced to 35 years in prison.   And once in prison, Manning declared that he was a she.   And so, bolstered by a slew of ACLU lawyers, Manning demanded a   operation, as well as associated hormone treatments.  That’s right, a criminal demanded such a remarkable medical dispensation, with, of course, the insistence that Uncle Sam pay it.  Not surprisingly, the Obama administration quickly agreed.   Thus we can step back and see: The left has slipped into the dialogue the silly notion that   surgery —  which costs $  thousand, not including hormone treatments, etc. —  is just another worthy  form of “healthcare. ”   And so, of course, as with Obamacare, the government should pay for it.  Now we can pause for a moment to recall that Trump himself has zero   animus.  Indeed, in his Cleveland acceptance speech, Trump carefully articulated the words, “LGBTQ” as he recalled the terrorist attack in Orlando, FL.  And he also invited Peter Thiel, the gay Silicon Valley mogul, to speak for him to the conventioneers.  Yet still, Trump has kept his perspective, distinguishing between basic human rights and foolish liberal boondoggles.  And so during the fall campaign, Trump challenged the “politically correct” Obama policy of “social engineering,” adding that  instances such as the Manning case were “ridiculous. ” Yet as The New Republic sobbed: It took Army officials nearly 18 months after she sought treatment for gender dysphoria to approve her for hormone treatments, but she is still required to conform to male military dress standards. And the magazine further worries that under a Trump administration, “She would probably be the first person to lose care” —  care being defined, of course, as including costly   surgery.  Meanwhile, the rest of us can say: Manning is a criminal, and maybe this is what a true punishment looks like.  5) Uphold   American nationalism.  It wasn’t so long ago, 2008, to be exact, that Obama traveled to Berlin to address his worldwide audience as “citizens of the world. ”  To which the proper response, of course, is that to be a “citizen of the world” is to be a citizen of nowhere.  Trump, of course, has always seen things differently from Obama: As he also said in Cleveland, “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. ”  In the meantime, we are starting to see, more and more, that   philosophy translated into personnel.  It’s been obvious for a long time that Trump admires generals indeed, on December 1, he picked another one, Marine Gen. James Mattis, to be his secretary of defense. So what might the rest of us conclude from Trump’s choices so far?  This much is obvious: Trump respects the military uniform, and those who made the conscious choice, decades ago, to don that uniform on behalf of the nation, thereby assuming the greatest possible personal risk.  Indeed, we can go further, and make a larger point about American nationalism: It’s hard to think of any category of American that more epitomizes the patriotic, nationalist spirit than the man or woman who volunteers to shoulder the burden of our national defense.  Of course, not everyone agrees: According to the MSM and most professors, nationalist sentiments are to be deemed only as “racist,” or “xenophobic. ”   Yet here’s a dissenting view from a   gay liberal, Jonathan Haidt of New York University, writing in The American Interest.  Haidt maintains that nationalism is, ultimately, an expression of affection, even love, for one’s own fellow citizens —  nothing more, and nothing less: Nationalists see patriotism as a virtue they think their country and its culture are unique and worth preserving.  This is a real moral commitment, not a pose to cover up racist bigotry.  Some nationalists do believe that their country is better than all others, and some nationalisms are plainly illiberal and overtly racist.  But as many defenders of patriotism have pointed out, you love your spouse because she or he is yours, not because you think your spouse is superior to all others. Thanks to the hard work and heroism of Gen. Mattis, Gen. Mike Flynn, and all the other military officers in Trump’s orbit —  along with, of course, the efforts of all other   personnel and veterans —  those who don’t agree with Haidt are free to express their contrary opinion.   Yet in the meantime, those who agree with Trump, Mattis, Flynn, et al. are equally free to express their opinion. (Except, of course, on PC college campuses.)  As Trump said on December 1: We are going to bring our country together, all of our country. We’re going to find common ground, and we will get the job done properly. God bless Donald Trump for seeking to bring the country together.  And yet here we can say, with all due respect, that perhaps the   was being a bit, shall we say, aspirational.  That is, do we really think that George Soros, Al Sharpton, and their legions of paid and unpaid protestors are ever going to clasp hands with Trump?  Yet as we have seen, Trump is ready, if need be, to do battle —  and he has the tools he needs, including a   army, a   action agenda, a basic common sense, and an instinctive   patriotism.  And so the battle of is to continue, and it probably will, Trump is  .  In other words, this tweeting and      will be governing in his inclusive, commonsensical,   style. Yes, the Trump Deal is emerging —  and the MSM and the Democrats will just have to deal with it.  </td>\n",

America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics. Remember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country you want, are the same people telling  …    [that said Trump wouldn’t have a chance of being here tonight. Oh, we love defeating those people, don’t we? Love it, love it, love it.] No longer can we rely on those same people in media and politics who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. ” Trump says “we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now. We don’t have much time, but history is watching.  It’s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. ” “I am asking for your support tonight so I can be your champion in the White House,” Trump says. “And I will be your champion. ” Trump says, “My opponent asks her supporters to recite a   loyalty pledge. It reads: ‘I’m With Her.’ I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: ‘I’m with you —  the American people.’ I am your voice. ” “So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am With You, I will fight for you, and I will win for you,” he says. “To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again.

He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people. ” 11:25: He says it’s time to show the world that America is back —  “bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. ” 11:19: Trump promises to take care of Veterans (he says Clinton missed the VA scandal and that’s one more sign that she is out of touch) and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will “uphold our laws and Constitution. ” He also thanks the Evangelical community who have been so good and supportive to him. He promises to get rid of the Johnson Amendment. “The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles and judicial philosophy. Very important,” he says. “This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association. And will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe. ” 11:17: Trump promises to repeal and replace Obamacare and fix TSA at the airport, which is a “total disaster. ” 11:15: Trump now talking about reforming tax laws, regulations, and energy restrictions. He says our miners and steel workers are going to go back to work again. He says his economic policies will create new wealth that will “build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. ” Trump says Clinton would rather protect bureaucrats than serve America’s children.   Chants of ”yes he will” from the crowd. Interesting contrast to ”Yes we can”  —   Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) July 22, 2016,  11:14: “I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or diminishes our freedom and independence. America First again. America First. ”   11:13: Trump rips Clinton for having supported every disastrous.   11:12: Trump on trade: I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many. It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office. I have made billions of dollars in business making deals  —   now I’m going to make our country rich again. Using the greatest business people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones. America has lost   third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. 11:09: Trump says his “greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. ” “Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they are going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class. ” TRUMP ON IMMIGRATION: 11:05:  Trump to families of victims of illegal immigrant crime: You “Are Alone No Longer. ” He promise to “build a great border wall. ” Trump on illegal immigration: “On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and, MY FRIEND, Jamiel Shaw. ” He says nothing has impacted him more —  not even close —  than illegal immigration. “These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain,” he says. “Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary  …    it’s so awful to be talking about this because we can solve this problem so easily  …    . for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?” He adds that, “These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. ” He vows to “stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate. ” “We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities,” he says. “I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. ” He continues: “By ending    on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. It won’t be happening very much anymore. Believe me. ” “Peace will be restored by enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas. Our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve,” he says. “Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied  —   and every politician who has denied them  …     to listen very closely to the words I am about to say: On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. ” 11:03: Trump on how immigration has impacted minorities: Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for   and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people. 10:59: Trump slams Hillary for wanting more Syrian refugees: My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never, ever will be. 10:57: Trump says we must abandoned the failed policies of   and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed. 10:54: Trump: “We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. ” Trump vows to protect our LGBT citizens from a “hateful foreign ideology. ” 10:53: Trump: Obama’s “irresponsible rhetoric” has divided us. “The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment  …     than frankly I have ever seen. ” He says Obama has failed America’s inner cities on every level. Trump says he will ask on every action he takes whether this will life better for kids in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, and Ferguson who have every right as any kid to achieve the American Dream.   10:50: Trump: “I am the law and order candidate. ” The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and four were badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country. Believe me. Believe me.   10:48: Trump says he is proud to have Pence at his side. He says we will bring the same economic success that Pence brought to Indiana. 10: 47: Trump: “I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. ” He says nobody knows the system better than he does, which is why he can fix it. Trump pivots and says Sanders’s supporters will join him because they agree on trade. He rails against deals that strip us of our wealth and jobs.   10:46: Trump says Clinton did much worse than being “extremely careless” or “negligent. ” He says Clinton’s single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it, esp. when others who have done far less have paid so dearly. He adds, “When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come. ”   10: 45: Trump says he can’t stand to see injustice and rips Clinton’s corruption: When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws  —   or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash  —   I am not able to look the other way. And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33, 000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence  —   I know that corruption has reached a level like never before. 10:43: Trump (after Code Pink protests): “How great is our police and how great is Cleveland?” Code Pink protester interrupts Donald Trump’s nomination speech.  —   Rebecca Shabad (@RebeccaShabad) July 22, 2016,  VIDEO: Protester Medea Benjamin @medeabenjamin from Code Pink being removed from RNC during Trump speech https:  .   —   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) July 22, 2016,  10:42: Trump to Forgotten Americans. “I AM YOUR VOICE. ” Trump speaking about forgotten Americans who work hard and no longer have a voice. He says they will be forgotten no longer and says, “I am your voice. ” 10:40: Trump: Hillary is their puppet. And they pull the strings. That’s why Hillary’s message is things will never change. Never, never. He says his message is things have to change and they have to change right now: A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.   10:38: TRUMP: “AMERICANISM, NOT GLOBALISM, WILL BE OUR CREDO. ” He adds, “The American people will come first, once again. ” 10:37: Trump wants to put his action plan for America that will put America First, unlike the Dems. Crowd chanting “  !   !” 10:37: Trump on Clinton’s failed record of “death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. ” He says a change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. 10:36: Crowd chanting “Lock her up. ” Trump responds, “let’s defeat her in November. ” He says he is certain Obama regrets appointing Clinton as his Sec. of State. 10:35: Trump, after talking about the   infrastructure in America, blasts Obama’s foreign policy in Iran, Libya, and Syria. He says America is far less safe and the world is far less stable than when Obama decided to put Clinton in charge of our foreign policy, Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing  —   it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria  —   and the whole world knew it meant nothing. 10:30: Trump on how Obama’s economy is impacting minorities: Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10   children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. 10:25: Trump on illegal immigration and the increase in murdered police officers: The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. Nearly 180, 000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources. He then talk about Sarah Root, who was murdered by an illegal immigrant: I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. 10:24: Trump says we can’t afford to be politically correct. He says go to the Dem. convention if you want to hear corporate spin and media myths. 10:22: Trump: “Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. ” Trump says, “I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored. The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation. I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore. ” 10:20: Trump: Trump says “we are a team” and who would have believed we would have received more than 14 million uctes and the GOP would get 60% more votes than it did eight years ago. “Who would have believed this?”  He says Democrats, on the other hand, received 20% fewer votes than they got four years ago. Not so good. He says, “Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order. ” [Trump has practiced reading off of the Teleprompter. He’s gotten much better.]   10:17: And now, Trump appears on stage.

She movingly tells the story of how Trump tore stories out of the newspaper about people he never met who were facing some hardship or injustice. He would ask his assistants to find the people and invite them to Trump Tower and draw upon his network to find them jobs or give them breaks. He says they left Trump Tower feeling that life could be great again. She says she has witnessed his “empathy” and “generosity” her entire life. She speaks about how his father values talent and is   and gender neutral. She speaks about how she used to walk alongside her dad on constructions sites to learn.

He says Democrats do the same old thing while Republicans are the “party of new ideas. ” He says Democrats depend on super delegates and bureaucrats while Republicans “are the party of the grassroots” that honor’s their decisions. He says Republicans know the classroom is not an assembly line and it is time to give power back to the parents. He says Democrats want healthcare choices in the hands of politicians while Republicans want choices in the hands of patients. He says Republicans believe in a  “better chance at the American Dream for everyone. ” Priebus says Clinton has perfected the art of politics for “personal gain” and reads ethics laws as carefully as Americans read junk mail. Priebus says Trump will stop illegal immigration and put Americans first.

Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.   …     America is far less safe  —   and the world is far less stable  —   than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy. I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. Her bad instincts, and her bad judgment  —   something pointed out by Bernie Sanders  —   are what caused many of the disasters unfolding today.   …     But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy. The problems, we face now  —   poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad  —   will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them.   …     As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. This will all change when I take office.   …     My message is that things have to change  —   and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.   …       Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. America is one of the   nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest   of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as 2 trillion dollars a year, and we will end it.   …     With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans. We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.   …     So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight:I’m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.</td>\n",

       "        <td>If you were an alien and had just beamed down to Doral, Fla. the gold letters on a Spanish   building amid 800 acres of golf courses would leave no doubt as to who owns the resort: TRUMP. You might, however, find yourself wondering if this Trump fellow is a reality television star, a titan of industry or a vintner. Trump chardonnay and Trump sauvignon blanc (about $25 each) line the shelves of the Marketplace Cafe at Trump National Doral Miami. Trump nail polish sets ($25) glittery Trump pouches ($30) and Empire by Trump eau de toilette ($62) are sold in a gift shop. A lounge area is replete with framed magazine covers of Donald J. Trump. There he is on Newsweek, mouth agape, pointing at the viewer, beside the words, “You’re Fired!” There he is in a tuxedo on the cover of Playboy with Brandi Brandt, a former Playmate, who appears to be clad in nothing more than his suit jacket. And there he is gazing at the camera, chin in hand, on the cover of GQ in an issue about “men who take risks and make millions. ” But it is the 2011 cover of a golf magazine, Fairways and Greens, that really grabs the viewer. Mr. Trump, with a golf club at his side, is shown next to the words: “President Trump?” Turns out, it was a prescient question. Mr. Trump’s candidacy has drawn attention not only to his policy positions, but also to everything that bears the Trump name, including about a dozen   hotels and resorts from Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii, to Turnberry Ayrshire, Scotland. This year, Trump Hotels  —   the hotel company founded in 2007 by Mr. Trump and three of his children (Donald Jr. Ivanka and Eric)  —   is planning to open Trump International Hotel  Tower Vancouver, Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro and Trump International Hotel, Washington, D. C. In coming years, the company said it will expand to Asia. And next year, it will introduce a lifestyle hotel brand. While the Trump name is ubiquitous, Trump Hotels may not be as familiar to travelers as larger brands with longer histories like Marriott and Hilton. Are Trump Hotels as big, brash and over the top as the man for whom they’re named? In visits to Trump properties in and around New York, Miami and Las Vegas, I set out to see how it feels to be a guest of the man who would be president. As you roll across the paths of Trump National Doral Miami in a golf cart emblazoned with a Trump crest, bird calls alternate with the thwack of golf balls, and every staff members offers a friendly nod or hello. Acre after acre is manicured with   flower beds, orderly rows of palm trees and clipped greens where golf luminaries like Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have trod. A fallen palm frond the size of a surfboard hadn’t been on the ground more than a few minutes before an employee pulled up in a golf cart, lifted it onto the roof and drove off, trailing an electric whir, and then, silence. It was a muggy spring afternoon, and the quietude belied the news that had broken days earlier. A staff member said the PGA Tour, which has held an annual tournament at Doral for more than half a century (the Trumps bought the property in 2012) was planning to move it  —   to Mexico. Mr. Trump, who last year had choice words for Mexican immigrants, broke the news on May 31 that the Tour is moving: “They’re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance,” he told Fox News. The PGA Tour commissioner said the move was  not a political statement. The next day, however, Ricardo Salinas, the chief executive of the Mexican conglomerate that’s moving the tournament, tweeted at Mr. Trump: “You’re welcome to join us at the WGC,” he wrote, referring to the World Golf Championships. “Only good things can turn out, if you know the real Mexico. ” Though the PGA Tour may be a thing of the past, Mr. Trump has poured some $250 million into the resort’s future. In April, nearly 50 “spa suites” were opened near the Trump Spa, part of the property’s extensive renovation. The suites, decorated in rich blues with abstract art that evokes the ocean, include soaking tubs use of the Trump Spa lounge areas and, in the evening, Trump wine. Inside the suites (a night in a   in June was $425) one finds Trump Hotel Collection products like bath crystals and a Trump yoga mat bag, one of several amenities to encourage “wellness. ” Gold is used sparingly: Objets d’art and glass boxes for storing jewelry or sunglasses lend an understated glamour. Perhaps it’s not surprising then that the spa suites were overseen not by Mr. Trump, whose aesthetic is more aligned with opulent hotels in the Middle East and Asia, but by Ivanka Trump, an executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization. Admiring a decorative gold sphere, I turned over a nearby vase to see if it had a mark from a designer like Kelly Wearstler or Jonathan Adler. It had a sticker: West Elm. Maybe someone ought to have peeled it off. But I’m glad they didn’t: Design trends today mix high and low with abandon one can picture young décor buffs sharing photos of the suites on Pinterest. The gold sphere was $29 to $39 on WestElm. com cream and gold coasters on the coffee table were $31 for four. A charming bud vase had a CB2 sticker ($10. 95 on CB2. com). Generally speaking, the hallways and rooms of Trump Hotels are surprisingly subdued, save for the occasional Trumpian flourish: a gold toilet handle, or chandeliers that appear to have been sized for the “Game of Thrones” giant Wun Wun. Beyond the gold and glossy exteriors and marble lobbies, the private spaces are   decorated in grays, cream and chocolates. That restraint extends to other aspects of the properties. Music at the pools and restaurants is often, refreshingly, not at full volume. And the hotels are nonsmoking, even in Las Vegas, a city where you can burn your paycheck at any number of hotel casinos. Yet Trump International Hotel Las Vegas doesn’t have a casino. Rather, it sells Trump piggy banks for $10. The facade of the Las Vegas property is another matter it’s the hotel with the unrepentant Midas touch. The building looks like a bar of gold bullion but, after all, it’s Vegas Mandalay Bay is equally blinding. “Make America Great Again” baseball caps are proffered in the Trump Store ($30) and adorn the bar at the poolside cafe, H2 Eau, amid bottles of vodka. “As long as you’re going to be thinking anyway,” reads a quote from Mr. Trump splashed across a   mirror at H2 Eau, “think big. ” The maxim applies to the rooms. My room in Las Vegas, upgraded to a suite at    —   possibly because the staff is attentive and it was the third time I booked a hotel as a Trump Card member (the brand’s free loyalty program) or because the hotel figured out where I work (I didn’t book using a New York Times email or phone number, though I used my name)  —   included a   refrigerator, a Wolf stove and a Bosch dishwasher. Even at Trump SoHo New York, the smallest rooms are an impressive 420 square feet. The price of admission befits a luxury hotel. The cheapest available room on a July weekend at Trump International Hotel  Tower New York was $563 a night, according to a recent online search. At Trump International Hotel  Tower Chicago, it was $420 a night. That said, rooms are not always out of reach. For instance, one search turned up rooms at Trump International Hotel Las Vegas for $165 a night. Restaurant prices are what one expects at   hotels. At BLT Prime at Trump National Doral Miami, ahi tuna was $37 a   New York strip steak was $51. The hotels also tend to have cafes and shops with affordable sandwiches and snacks. If, however, you get a yen for, say, the bag of gold Trump chocolate bullions in your room at Trump SoHo, it will set you back $35. Sitting at a table in the Trump Bar at Trump Tower New York, the skyscraper used as Wayne Enterprises in the film “The Dark Knight Rises,” Ivanka Trump said the Trump Hotels customer can’t be pigeonholed. “We have millennials,” she said one spring evening during a reception in conjunction with the N. Y. U. International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, “people from the entertainment business, entrepreneurs, titans of industry and those at the beginning of their careers. ” During recent visits to Trump Hotels, I met men and women on vacation or traveling on business, some with families. Guests spoke English, French, Chinese, Hebrew and more. The Trump Hotels website is available in several languages, including Chinese and Arabic, even as Mr. Trump proposes to squeeze China and bar Muslims from entering the United States. Asked to describe their guests, staffers at Trump SoHo said they are chief executives, athletes and actors. The Kardashians have been frequent visitors, though that doesn’t necessarily reflect their politics. “I know you like the Trump hotel, but honestly how do you feel about Trump running for president? ,” Khloé Kardashian’s friend, Malika Haqq, asked her in November on their vlog, Ebony  Ivory. Ms. Kardashian replied: “Wha —   how does that have to do with the Trump hotel?” “Well, no,” she continued, “I don’t think he should be president. ” Other celebrity guests have chimed in, too. After Mr. Trump said that he would bar Muslims from entering the United States, Lucy Lawless, who played the title role in the television series “Xena: Warrior Princess,” tweeted: “I used to stay in Trump hotels. Can never again,” and urged her more than 140, 000 Twitter followers to boycott the brand. Recently, “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” created a fake commercial for Trump Hotels with the tagline “We’re not to blame!” and apologies to groups Mr. Trump may have offended. Indeed, some companies think Mr. Trump’s campaign has hurt his hotel business. Hipmunk, the travel comparison site, said in May that “while overall Hipmunk hotel bookings have been on the rise    that has not been the case with bookings of Trump Hotels. ” The share of Trump bookings on Hipmunk as a percent of total bookings was down 59 percent year over year. In New York City and Las Vegas, Trump Hotels’ share as a percentage of each city’s total hotel bookings tumbled more than 70 percent. But Trump Hotels executives say the brand has never been stronger. Four of its hotels were among the 0. 4 percent of hotels that made AAA’s Five Diamond list this year. Asked at Trump Tower if Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign has helped or hurt the hotels, Ivanka Trump said “it’s been an upward trajectory,” adding that it may have been the case without the campaign. Behind the    sheets, there has been controversy, from the bankruptcy of Mr. Trump’s hotels and casinos in Atlantic City, N. J. to a lawsuit involving Trump SoHo from buyers who alleged they had been defrauded. More recently, Mr. Trump is suing the chefs José Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian, both of whom canceled plans to open restaurants in the Trump International Hotel, Washington, D. C. because of Mr. Trump’s comments about Mexican immigrants. Still, the family business rolls on. In the fall the company plans to share details about its new lifestyle hotel brand, as yet unnamed. One name it won’t have is Trump. Is that because the name isn’t good for business? Ivanka Trump said it’s because some properties simply aren’t right for the Trump brand. It’s common, in fact, for hotel companies to spawn brands that don’t use their name. Marriott, for instance, has nearly 20 brands, including the  . So, are Trump Hotels as splashy as the man for whom they’re named? Only on the surface. Beyond the facades and lobbies there’s a feeling of calm and comfort. No smoking. No gaudy colors. Even the service is what one employee called “ghost service”  —   omnipresent but silent. Mr. Trump, too, is omnipresent. Just not silent. In guest rooms he appears in videos about Trump Hotels on a television channel in a seemingly   loop. “The thing I do best is build,” says Mr. Trump during one featuring the forthcoming Trump hotel in the nation’s capital, set to open weeks before the United States presidential election. “Better than ‘The Apprentice,’ ” he says. “Better than politics. ”</td>\n",

[All times Eastern.  8:08 AM: From last night  —   Watch   anarchists destroy a U. S. Flag and light fires in D. C.: WARNING: Explicit language,  12:53 AM: Watch video below of Trump’s remarks at the donor reception earlier this evening: 11:10 PM: Tens of thousands of   protestors and celebrities kicked off   filmmaker Michael Moore’s “100 Days of Resistance” Thursday, rallying outside Donald Trump’s New York City International Hotel. Breitbart’s Jerome Hudson reported on the event “which featured speeches from political figures including New York Mayor Bill De Blasio and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and actors Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, and Mark Ruffalo. ” Moore told the crowd that America has entered into a “very dangerous” time, after electing a “sociopath. ” “With a lot of work on our part, we will stop this man,” Moore shouted. “He will not last four years. ” “If your rep is a Democrat, tell   you expect them to AGGRESSIVELY fight the Trump agenda  —   and if they don’t, you will work with others to support a true progressive in the Democratic primary in 2018,” Moore added.  10:40 PM:   protestors continue to gather outside the National Press Club in Washington, D. C. Thursday. Here is a list by Breitbart’s Lee Stranahan of the 75 leftist groups trying to stop Trump from taking office. ”Our streets, our streets, our streets!” Protesters chants at the police during the demonstration outside the Deploraball. pic. twitter.   —   Neil W. McCabe (@NeilWMcCabe) January 20, 2017,  10:09 PM: AP reports: 10 Promises Trump Made for His First Day, WASHINGTON (AP)  —   Behind in the polls in late October, Donald Trump ventured to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to give American voters a “contract” detailing what he would achieve during his first day in office. Beneath a list of 18 major actions was the flourish of Trump’s familiar signature and a blank space for voters to sign. But as Trump becomes president on Friday, it remains hazy as to which actions he will immediately take. The list included several items likely to fire up Republican voters but backed up by scant policy. It includes “begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants” and “cancel every unconstitutional executive action   …     by President Obama. ” Trump has already backed down from one pledge to label China a currency manipulator, recently saying he would first like to speak with the Chinese leadership. A look at 10 of the key promises Trump made for his first day as president:  —  Introduce a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits.  —  Freeze hiring for the federal government to reduce payrolls, although the military, public safety and public health agencies would be exempt.  —  Ban White House and congressional officials from becoming lobbyists for five years after they leave the government.  —  Announce plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico or withdraw from the deal.  —  Formally withdraw from the   Partnership.  —  Lift restrictions on mining coal and drilling for oil and natural gas.  —  Remove any   roadblocks to energy projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline.  —  Cancel U. S. payments to U. N. climate change programs and redirect the money to U. S. water and environmental infrastructure.  —  Stop all federal funding to “sanctuary cities,” places where local officials don’t arrest or detain immigrants living in the country illegally for federal authorities.  —  Suspend immigration from regions associated with terrorism where vetting is difficult. 9:58 PM: Breitbart News’ Ian Hanchett reports: During a live report on Thursday’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on the Fox News Channel, a young man protesting in Washington, DC claimed to have started a fire in the street, “Because I felt like it.

C. on the eve of his inauguration. He told a cheering crowd that in 2018 Republicans are going to win more seats in the Senate. Breitbart’s Neil Munro reports: “We have an election coming up in two years,” Trump told the crowd after thanking his early and his late donors. “We’re going to get a lot of them elected  …     [GOP Sen.] Mitch McConnell is here, he’s smiling so big,” Trump joked. McConnell is the GOP leader of the Senate. In 2018, he will have the opportunity to push his narrow 52 to 48 majority up to dominant 58 or even 60 seats. If the GOP reaches 60 Senate seats, then McConnell will usually be able to break the Democrats’s “filibuster” ability to block legislation. Forty Senators are needed to maintain a filibuster.   Senate Democrats face   in November 2018, while only eight Republicans must face the voters. Among the Democrats, nine Senators are either freshmen or won less than 53 percent in their prior election, and four will face the voters in states won by Trump.

Thank you very much everybody, and thank you Tom. I’d like to congratulate our incredible entertainers tonight. Toby, and Lee Greenwood and all of the great talent. It was really very special. I also have to thank our incredible military right here. Thank you. Stand up, please. You guys were really great. Thank you. So this journey began 18 months ago. I had something to do with it, but you had much more to do with it than I did. I’m the messenger. I’m just the messenger. And we were tired. And I love you. Believe me, I love you. We all got tired of seeing what was happening. And we wanted change, but we wanted real change. And I look so forward to tomorrow. We’re going to see something that is going to be so amazing. So many people have poured into Washington, D. C. This started out tonight being a small little concert, and then we had the idea maybe we’ll do it in front of the Lincoln Memorial. I don’t know if it’s ever been done before. But if it has, very seldom. And the people came by the thousands and thousands, and here we are tonight, all the way back. All the way back. So it’s a movement that began, it’s a movement that started, and it’s a movement like we’ve never seen anywhere in the world, they say. There’s never been a movement like this and it’s something very, very special. And we’re going to unify our country, and our phrase  —   you all know it, half of you are wearing the hat  —   “Make America Great Again. ” But we’re going to make America great for all of our people, everybody. Everybody throughout our country. That includes the inner cities, that includes everybody.  And we’re going to do a special job, and I can only tell you that 18 months ago, we never knew, a lot of people didn’t know, some people had a feeling. A lot of people didn’t give us much of a chance, but we understood what was happening. And that last month of the campaign, when I traveled around to every place that you can imagine. State after state after state, speech after speech. And we had ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand people. There was never an empty seat, just like tonight. We didn’t know if anybody would even come tonight. This hasn’t been done before. And you look. It was the same way. And we all knew that last month of the campaign. I think a lot of us knew the first week of the campaign, but that last month of the campaign we knew that something special was happening.  And I can only tell you this: The polls started going up, up, up, but they didn’t want to give us credit. Because they forgot about a lot of us. On the campaign I called it “the forgotten man” and “the forgotten woman. ” Well, you’re not forgotten anymore. That I can tell you. Not forgotten anymore. So I want to thank my great family, my incredible wife Melania. They’ve been so supportive, and it wasn’t easy for them. But they have been so supportive. I want to thank you, most importantly. And I promise you that I will work so hard. We’re going to get it turned around. We’re going to get our jobs back. We’re not going to let other countries take our jobs any longer. We’re going to build up our great military. We’re going to build it up. We’re going to strengthen our borders. We’re going to do things that haven’t been done for our country for many, many decades. It’s going to change. I promise you it’s going to change. So I’ll see you tomorrow. And I don’t care frankly if it’s going to be beautiful or if it’s going to rain like crazy. Makes no difference to me. I have a feeling it’s going to be beautiful. But I will see you tomorrow, and I’m going to be cheering you on. You’re going to cheer me on, but I’m going to be cheering you on. Because what we’ve done is so special. All over the world they’re talking about it. All over the world. And I love you folks, and we’re going to work together. And we are going to  —   make America great again. And I’ll add: Greater than ever before! Thank you very much and enjoy the fireworks. Thank you everybody. Thank you for joining us at the Lincoln Memorial   a very special evening! Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! pic. twitter.   —   Donald J.

       "        <td>Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders were huge frontrunners before New Hampshire’s     primary. But as Barack Obama found out in 2008,   polls in the Granite State can often be wrong. If Sanders wins New Hampshire, pressure will mount on Clinton to win crucial primary states like South Carolina. If Trump wins New Hampshire, GOP candidates who finish behind him will battle to emerge as the   alternative heading into South Carolina in the days ahead.  Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates throughout the evening. 1:20: David Brody writes that Trump’s “silent majority was extremely vocal Thursday night in New Hampshire” and argues that it was also an excellent night for fellow   candidate Cruz: Donald Trump’s Silent Majority was extremely vocal Tuesday night in New Hampshire. As a matter of fact they were so loud that the whole country heard them loud and clear. That’s what happens when you trounce the field by double digits. For the first time, Trump took his, “huge fabulous poll numbers” and made them count at the ballot box. What Trump’s victory shows is that the billionaire’s populist ‘angry at politicians” message’ resonates with voters who are both moderate and dissatisfied with the Republican Party. There are plenty of them up in New Hampshire. Now Trump needs to be able to take that momentum and be able to translate it to states like South Carolina that lean more conservative and more evangelical. Iowa was similar in that regard and Trump did well. But he’ll need to somehow get the ground game going full tilt in South Carolina because Cruz’s team is a machine and they proved it in Iowa. Speaking of Ted Cruz, it was an excellent night for him. His strong top tier finish in New Hampshire needs to be put in perspective. Strong evangelical candidates typically don’t play well in the more moderate libertarian New Hampshire. But Cruz has depth. He not only has evangelical ‘street cred’ but he also has libertarian ‘street cred’ since he is, after all, a constitutionalist at heart. In other words, he can play in both camps and that’s a major plus. 1:15: Trump: 35. 2% Kasich: 15. 9% Cruz: 11. 5% Bush: 11. 1% Rubio: 10. 6% (92 % reporting) 12:20: Decimal points matter for the campaign narrative.

S. military, and he says he has a “great relationship” with the vets. He says our military is “laughed at” and “scoffed at” and we are going to “rebuild it. ” Trump says our military is “not in a good state of preparedness” and “hopefully we’re not going to have to use it. ” Trump says, like the   business, the military often buys things that they don’t want because of   control the politicians. He says he will not be beholden to anybody because he was   his campaign. Trump says he has patched things up with Fox and will go to all of the debates. Trump says he likes the debates and thinks he did “very well” at the last debate. Trump says Rubio is a “good guy” but “took a beating” at the debate and it “certainly did not help him. ” “The ultimate poll is the one we just had,” he says. Trump says Rubio would have been a lot higher had he not misfired. 11:55: GOP #Smartset: Sticking with my prediction: Trump will win no caucuses or primaries, and will run behind Ron Paul 2012 in IA and NH.  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) December 8, 2015,  11: 25: Victorious Trump, Thank you, New Hampshire!

You made it happen. You made it happen. ” Will he be giving out cars to everyone? He sounds more like an analyst. Rubio did a better job projecting “victory” after not winning a race. Kasich says when he’s president of the United States (delayed cheers) “we’re going to have a battering ram” to knock down the walls of the city if it doesn’t want to change. He says we will solve the problems of America by not being extreme. 10:00: Trump   Jeb’s speech.

He blasts the political hacks negotiating deals that are screwing America. He says the world “is going to respect us again. Believe me. ” Trump mentions that what caught on was that he was   his campaign. He says the lobbyists who fund campaigns don’t love our country and “we have to do something about it. ” He says “when you see the kind of deals made in this country,” the politicians are making them for their benefit and now “we’re going to make the deals for the American people. ” He says in a nutshell, “we’re going to make great trade deals” and “rebuild our  military” to make it “so powerful” that “nobody is going to mess with us. ” He says “we’re going to take care of our vets. ” Trump says “we’re going to have strong, incredible borders” and “people are going to come into our country and they’re going to come into our country legally. ” He says “we’re going to build a wall and it’s going to be built. ” He says we’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.

The attention spans of viewers watching political speeches are short. 9:54: Newsweek’s Matt Cooper argues   are appealing because they are putting America First: The stunning victories of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in the New Hampshire primaries marks the first time both parties have been so upended at the same moment. The    casino mogul and    socialist have changed everything. And the question now is what does it mean both for the nomination and the country. Take the country first. So many banalities have been used to compare Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump: “They’re outsiders. ” “They’re  . ” “Their supporters are angry. ” All of that is true. But the big thing the two insurgents have in common is as obvious and ignored as their stump speeches. Whenever each of them mounts the podium they take time to state how America is stacking up poorly against other nations. 9:50: Spurs coach Greg Popovich not happy with New Hampshire’s primary results when told   won during   interview: Popovich gonna Popovich #SASatMIA https:  .   —   NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 10, 2016,  9:40: Sanders gave his traditional stump speech and recited his standard talking points from the  .

I’m honored and humbled to have the generous backing of so many citizens of The Granite State, and I thank everyone for their kind hospitality and support. I commend the many staff and volunteers from New Hampshire who worked tirelessly to spread our call to return faith, integrity and common sense to American leadership. Across New Hampshire I heard from people who were sick and tired of D. C. insider political games and manipulation. Voters around the country are looking for new leadership in Washington, which is why I’m working so hard to return ‘We the People’ to the White House. I will carry on this fight for as long as the people stand with me. As we now move on to South Carolina, Nevada and the Super Tuesday states, I will continue to stand for integrity, accountability and honest leadership. ” 9:29: “Thank you New Hampshire,” Sanders says. He says Clinton called and was very gracious.  “We won because of  your energy,” he says. Sanders says government belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors and their super PACs. He says he had no campaign organization, money, and were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America when he started his campaign nine months ago. He speaks about the “Yuge” voter turnout and says that’s the excitement that the Democratic party needs to succeed in November. He says Dems need to be “aroused” like the New Hampshire electorate. “That needs to happen all over this country. ” He says “let us never forget that Democrats and progressives win when voter turnout is high” and “Republicans win when people are demoralized and voter turnout is low. ” He says tonight “we served notice to the political and economic establishment in this country that the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system is undermining democracy” and a rigged economy where all new income and wealth goes to the top 1%. He says voters in New Hampshire sent a message to the    establishment. He says “what the people here have said is given the enormous crisis facing our country, it is just too late for the same old, same old establishment politics and establishment economics. The people want real change. ” Sanders says he hears this from conservatives and moderates as well and rails against a campaign finance system that allows Wall Street to buy elections. He says Americans understand that that is “not what democracy is about. That is what oligarchy is about. And we will not allow that to continue. ” He says he does not have a Super PAC and he doesn’t want a Super PAC. He says he is deeply moved that his campaign’s financial support comes from more than one million Americans who have made more than 3. 7 million individual contributions. “That is more individual contributions in the history of the United States up until this point in the election,” he says. Sanders says he is going to New York city for a Wall Street fundraiser but says he is holding a fundraiser right here. And asks people to go to this website and contribute. “Please help us raise the funds we need  …    to take the fight to Nevada, South Carolina, and the states on Super Tuesday. ” Sanders says he will pay for all of his plans by imposing a tax on “Wall Street speculation. ”  Sanders says he has the feeling “that the kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well” after saying his opponents have thrown everything at him besides the kitchen sink. 9:27: Yikes: American flags crumpled on floor at Clinton campaign HQ: With many hours to go, Clinton’s staff has flags ready for their election night party    photo by @melinamara pic. twitter.   —   Post Politics (@postpolitics) February 9, 2016,  9:26: Van Jones on CNN says Clinton sounds like a “technocrat. ” 9:16: Clinton’s speech is way too much prose when it needed to be more poetry tonight. She is not Bill. She seems like she’s reading a term paper and checking off boxes about why she and Sanders agree on various issues. Clinton claims she and Sanders both want to get secret money out of politics. She points out that Citizens United was about a movie that was targeting here. She says they both agree that Wall Street needs to be checked and she knows how to do it. Clinton talks about a “growth” and “fairness economy. ” Then speaks about “breaking through the barriers of bigotry. ” “  parents shouldn’t have to worry that their children will be harassed, humiliated —  even shot —  because of the color of their skin,” she says, starting to appeal to all of the party’s interest groups. “Immigration families shouldn’t have to lie awake at night listening for a knock on the door. LGBT Americans shouldn’t be fired from their jobs because of who they are and who they love. ” Clinton then talks about “equal pay for women. ” Clinton says we need to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity for every person. She talks about her history of fighting against “injustice” and says “when people anywhere in America are held back by injustice, that demands action. ” She yells about “human rights across the board for every single American. ” She says she knows she has work to do with young people. She says she knows how it feels to stumble and fall and says it doesn’t matter if you get knocked down but whether you get back up. 9:14: From Breitbart’s Alex Swoyer: Trump supporters boo as Hillary Clinton takes podium on to speak. 9:11: Clinton camp worried Sanders will get infusion of cash after New Hampshire to sustain his campaign for the long haul: Source close to the Clintons: Main worry after NH blowout: “Bernie’s ability to raise millions off of this”  —   perpetual financial oxygen.  —   Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) February 10, 2016,  9:09: Fox News projects Kasich will finish in second. 9:07: Another mainstream media reporter says Trump’s win is still “stunning. ” I know we’ve seen it coming for weeks, but stunning nonetheless for Hillary Clinton to be felled in NH  —   by Sanders, and by double digits.  —   Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) February 10, 2016,  Trump is headed for the biggest win margin in a NH GOP primary since McCain’s   victory over Bush in 2000.  —   Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) February 10, 2016,  Given high turnout today, Trump is poised to get more raw New Hampshire votes than Romney in his commanding 2012 victory.  —   Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) February 10, 2016,  9:05: Hillary Congratulates Sanders in Tweet: To @BernieSanders, congratulations.

Breitbart News met Shields at Donald Trump’s New Hampshire Primary Party. “We’ve been kicked to the side. Finally, we hear the ring of truth in one man and that man is Donald Trump,” he stated. “I really wasn’t a big fan of Donald Trump until I saw him on the escalator and I heard what he was saying about what was happening in this country, neglected truths that have been going on for decades, and I said, ‘This man is the man that we need. ’” “I went into the flag business in 1992,” he told Breitbart News as he was selling Trump flags in the parking lot of Trump’s New Hampshire Primary Party on Tuesday night in Manchester. “I’ve been into it for awhile. ” Shields told Breitbart News this is the first time he’s actually been to a Trump event selling the flags, and if he has enough interest, wants to set up an online website for supporters.

About    said they were dissatisfied with the federal government, including about    who were angry about the way it was working. And for many, the dissatisfaction extends to the GOP itself. Half said they felt betrayed by politicians from the Republican Party, and about the same share said they wanted the next president to be from outside the political establishment. Though Democrats voting on Tuesday were less apt to say they felt betrayed by their party or to express anger with the federal government, about   said they were worried about the economy. About    said they thought life for the next generation of Americans would be worse than life today, and    said they thought the nation’s economy favored the wealthy. 5:52: Breitbart’s John Nolte points out that exit polls found that nearly half of Republicans made up their minds today: The early exit polls show that nearly half of Republican voters (46%) polled today made up their minds today.

It’s not that complicated, folks. In 2008, Obama was aligned with his party’s base against the Iraq War and brought in new black voters who felt the party’s establishment had taken them for granted. In 2016, Rubio was not aligned with his party’s base on amnesty while Trump, who is, is bringing in   voters who believe the GOP has been taking them from granted. John Edwards’s “Silence is Betrayal” speech at Riverside Church didn’t help Clinton either during the 2008 election cycle. This ain’t rocket science. ] 6:10: Cook Political Report: Upcoming Calendar Favorable to Trump: The upcoming calendar is favorable to Trump. The south and Midwest have all pretty much weighed in at this point. Cruz didn’t do as well in the south as he should have. Kasich didn’t do as well in the Midwest as he should have. Now, it’s now time for the west and northeast to have their say. On the one hand, the blue states up in   (New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania) should favor the more establishment candidacy of Kasich. In 2012, Romney easily defeated Rick Santorum in these states. However, Trump has a regional appeal that makes him uniquely positioned for these states. And, despite early predictions that closed primaries, as most of these northeastern states will be, would hinder Trump, he’s managed to win in both open and closed contests. It’s easy to see how Trump carries not just New York, but also Rhode Island, Delaware, and even Connecticut. Moreover, Trump continues to win among ‘somewhat conservative’ Republicans, the group of voters that have proven to be the most predictive of winning the nomination. Of the 20 states that have voted  —   and have exit poll data  —   Trump has carried the ‘somewhat conservative vote in 16 of them, including wins last night in Illinois, Florida, North Carolina and Missouri. Trump’s immigration stance will help him in Arizona on March 22, a winner take all state with 58 delegates. And, we should expect him to do well in   areas of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Washington state. Moreover, the map isn’t all that favorable to Cruz. Not only are the northeastern states a cultural mismatch for Cruz, there are also few remaining caucuses left on the calendar. Caucuses, with their more socially conservative constituency and emphasis on grassroots organizing, have been great for the Cruz campaign. Of the 21 states that vote between now and June 7, however, only four hold caucuses. Cruz is the only candidate with the money and the expertise to compete in the arcane congressional level delegate fights in delegate rich states like California and New York. That may be enough to fracture the vote enough to prevent Trump from getting the total number of delegates he needs, though it might not prevent a Trump “win” in the state.   6:02: The Americans returns tonight and is adopting Trump’s slogan to promote its heralded program: Making #TheAmericans Great, Again! @Vulture celebrates its return with interviews, review of the new season,  more. https:  .   —   The Americans (@TheAmericansFX) March 15, 2016,  5:58: Coulter: NEW COLUMN IS POSTED!

After checking the game tape, so to speak, it turns out that the reader was talking about Kayleigh McEnany’s appearance on Tuesday’s edition of Wolf. When asked if Palin’s endorsement benefited Trump, she said that “it plays into the image of Donald Trump being for everyday Americans. Sarah Palin may not speak like an Ivy League professor in the most flourished rhetoric we would like but she is real and authentic and she resonates with voters because of that. ” Her comments were more refreshing because, as Blitzer pointed out, McEnany went to Harvard. Take it from me, it takes someone who has been in elite   circles to 1) be secure, 2) not need to be accepted by them, and 3) see the ridiculousness of those cultures, especially how they look down on “outsiders” like Palin. McEnany, who is also an ardent Trump supporter, is a breath of fresh air on CNN. So is Jeffrey Lord. Almost everyone else from the “right” that CNN has on is either a hack who speaks    gobbledygook or just      to regular Americans. Yawn. They have “political professional” stamped all over them and desperately seem like they want nothing more than the adulation of their MSM “bettors. ” McEnany obviously isn’t one of them. The types of people inside the Beltway who reflexively hate Palin have a few things in common: 1) they are usually miserable,   people who are unhappy with their lives 2) if they don’t have Ivy League pedigrees or have not been in elite social circles, they desperately crave to be in that “crowd” and see bashing Palin as their ticket to get in those circles 3) if they have Ivy League pedigrees or have been in elite social circles, they are snotty elitists against whom Americans are revolting 4) they were probably dweebs growing up and are trying to   their childhoods in D. C. by trying to turn D. C. into “Hollywood for ugly people. ” More importantly, though, they don’t realize how counterproductive it is to mock Palin for not speaking the King’s English. Is it any surprise the same idiots who mocked Palin ridiculed Trump’s syntax? And is it any surprise how gloriously it backfired? In what may be one of the most important articles written about this election cycle,   Gobry wrote in The Week: As many critics gleefully point out, Trump is not very good with the English language. He certainly doesn’t speak like someone you would think of as a presidential candidate. It’s not just his Northeastern accent. He occasionally screws up with spelling and grammar. Trump gets mocked a lot for this. Especially on Twitter, and especially by people like me  —     members of the media elite. On Friday morning, Trump misspelled “honor” and “lightweight” on Twitter. The high priests of Manhattan media were almost beside themselves with delight. So let me say this in a way you elites can understand: As David Foster Wallace explains in a brilliant essay on English usage, there isn’t just one “English. ” As elite liberals are apt to understand in other contexts, what we call Standard English is really just one dialect of English  —   the English of rich, educated, largely white English speakers. There are many other dialects in English, associated with different regions, ethnicities, classes, and so on. Trump speaks the language of his voters  —   unlike other presidential candidates, and unlike people who go on TV to be professional pundits. And what does Trump tell these voters? That the elite are against them. That they despise them. And what do elites do? Prove Trump right by sneering at a Trump trait that he shares with many of his voters. Trump and his voters don’t speak Standard English, nor do they speak its cousin dialect, Politically Correct English. As Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum points out, many people dislike political correctness, not because they secretly harbor bigoted views, or because they have a principled belief in a culture of free inquiry, but simply because Politically Correct English is a foreign dialect, which changes frequently and unpredictably. And if you don’t always master its nuances, you might suffer withering social opprobrium. (You’re not exactly sure what gender to refer to Caitlyn Jenner as? You bigot!) As the French thinker Pierre Bourdieu pointed out many decades ago, such systems of etiquette often function as ways for the ruling class to control the ruled, enforce class privilege, and keep the ladder to the upper class nice and slippery. And this particular form of social control only seems to be exercised against one type of person. Trump connects with the white working class, with the socially downtrodden, with the frustrated and despairing, and with the poorly educated and financially struggling not in spite of his   manner of speaking, but because of it. The wealthy, urban elite ought to remember that before they turn Trump’s misspellings into a cocktail party punch line. It’s worth nothing that Rubio’s campaign went in the toilet as soon as he started mocking Donald Trump’s spelling errors on Twitter.] 4:42: Van Jones concedes Trump can beat Hillary Clinton on CNN. 4:40: We have the Clinton campaign right where we want them: Sanders campaign manager says that they are ”essentially” where they ”expected to be” at this point in the race.  —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) March 16, 2016,  4:30: Maybe they will join the 500 members of the GOP Smart Set to start a third party that will do as well as the No Labels movement (but at least the incompetent Smart Set consultants will get paid for another election cycle —  and that’s all that matters to them) : Where will Marco Rubio’s Silicon Valley support turn? https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) March 16, 2016,  4:17: Michael Jordan?

GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT CALLS ON REPUBLICANS TO COME TOGETHER, I’m asking all Republicans today to come together and begin preparing to win the general election in November. With his victories yesterday, I believe it is now time for Republicans to accept and respect the will of the voters and coalesce behind Donald Trump. This has been a hard fought primary, with an outstanding roster of excellent candidates, including two of Florida’s favorite sons, and several Republican Governors who are close friends of mine. But the voters are speaking clearly  —   they want a businessman outsider who will dramatically shake up the status quo in Washington. When I first ran for Governor the political class and party leaders opposed me with great vigor, and some even said if I won the primary they would never vote for me. But the voters had other ideas, and they are the only ones who count. Here’s what really matters  —   we have to elect a Republican in the fall in order to grow jobs, rebuild our military, and put a person who respects the Constitution on the Supreme Court. This is the stuff that truly matters. If we spend another four months tearing each other apart, we will damage our ability to win in November. It’s time for an end to the Republican on Republican violence. It’s time for us to begin coming together, we’ve had a vigorous primary, now let’s get serious about winning in November.</td>\n",

       "        <td>***Live Updates*** Republicans Debate in South Carolina Moderator Urged Obama to ’Pulverize’ GOP - Breitbart</td>\n",
       "        <td>GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) Dr. Ben Carson, Ohio Governor John Kasich, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush will debate in South Carolina on Saturday evening just hours after the death of conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.  When Democrats debated on Thursday, one of their moderators —  PBS’s Judy Woodruff —  was a Clinton Foundation donor who conveniently did not ask Hillary Clinton about her email scandal just hours after news about the Clinton Foundation subpoenas dominated the news cycle. Republicans will not be as lucky. CBS’s John Dickerson, who urged President Barack Obama to “pulverize” Republicans, will moderate tonight’s debate. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. The establishment class seemed like they were desperately trying to create a “moment”  like the one that benefited Newt Gingrich during CNN’s South Carolina debate before the 2012 South Carolina primary to help Rubio. But the audience reaction after Gingrich blasted moderator John King after he asked him about his   was organic. The cheers today after mundane Rubio responses came off as inorganic and made the audience looked like they were trying a bit too hard to help “their” candidate. Don’t think viewers will be swayed like they were in 2012. Mission accomplished for the mainstream media. Why are these people moderating GOP debates? I will pick some winners and losers for this debate. But I think this was a very bad debate for the GOP writ large.  —   Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) February 14, 2016,  A very discordant debate that was all over the place. Closing statements: Trump: He says politicians are “all talk and no action. ” He says we are $19 trillion in debt. “We need a change. We need a very big change. We’re going to make our country great again. ” Trump says we don’t win anymore  …     with healthcare, ISIS, the military  …     we don’t care of our vets  …     we don’t take care of our borders. ” Trump says “we’re going to start winning again” and “we’re not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and lobbyists. ” Trump says “I’m working for you. I’m not working for anybody else. ” Cruz: Cruz says South Carolina has a critical choice to make because out country literally hangs in the balance. He asks them if they want another Washington dealmaker or a proven conservative “who will stand and fight with you each and every day. ” He says repealing Obamacare, passing a simple flat tax, and abolishing the IRS will not be easy. But he says “if we stand with the American people, we can do it. ” Cruz says two branches of government hang in the balance and if we nominate the wrong candidate  …     the Second Amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty  …     hang in the balance. He says he doesn’t want to look his daughters in the eye sand say  we lost their liberties. He asks voters who they know will defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution and will stand up to our enemies and defeat them and secure our borders to keep America safe. Rubio: He says this is a difficult time in our country where people are living paycheck to paycheck. He blasts a culture where wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong. He says all the things that once held our families together are under assault and America is not respected around the world. He says 2016 can be a turning point and that is why he is running for president. He says he will embrace free enterprise, will be a a country that says life begins at conception, be a country where marriage is between one man and one woman, and where our rights come from our Creator. He says he will unify this party and grow it and make the 21st century a new American century. Jeb: He says the next president will be confronted with an unforeseen challenge like a pandemic or an attack. He says the question is who do you want sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office. He says he would govern with a steady hand and unite the country because he did it in Florida after eight hurricanes. He says he has a servant’s heart and a backbone and will keep Americans safe and secure. Carson: He says this is the first generation not expected to do better than their parents. Carson says some call this the “new normal” but there is nothing normal about it. He says Stalin said to bring America down, you have undermine our spiritual life, our patriotism, and our morality. He says “we the people can stop that decline starting right here in South Carolina. ” Carson says he can not only win but “turn this thing around. ” And he blasts the media class for manipulating people into thinking certain candidates can’t win, etc. He says he will be accountable to everybody and beholden to no one. Kasisch: He will send power, money, influence back to where we all live. He says people are not waiting on a president and the Lord wants us to be connected. He says we are part of a very big mosaic and the spirit of America rests in all of us, in taking care of the children, the lady next door who lost her husband, fixing schools, and telling kids to stay off drugs. He wants Americans to realize that they were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone. By attacking @JebBush relentlessly, @realDonaldTrump is crowding out @tedcruz and @marcorubio  —   very effective #GOPDebate strategy,  —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 14, 2016,  10:43: Dickerson asks Rubio what he would ask a previous president about the job. Rubio praises Reagan. Says what Reagan inherited is not unlike what Reagan inherited. He says the question he would ask is how did he inspire again the American people to believe in the future and what did it take to ensure that the American people, despite all of the difficulties of the time, had a sense of optimism  …     [John Dickerson throwing batting practice to Rubio here] 10:42: Trump says he never went bankrupt and he used the laws of the land to benefit his companies just like the biggest leaders of the company. He says Jeb put so much debt on Florida and increased spending that as soon as Jeb got out of office, Florida crashed. He accuses Jeb of loading Florida up with debt while spending went through the roof. Jeb says Florida led the nation in job growth 7 of his 8 years and Florida didn’t go bankrupt and call it a success like Trump did after some of his businesses went through bankruptcies. 10:40: Dickerson asks Jeb about his comments re: his   having a hard time in today’s GOP. He says the dysfunction in Washington is terrible and we need a president who doesn’t disparage people and brag about using the legal system during bankruptcies. He says a president needs to forge consensus and adds that most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and he is the person with the proven record to turn the economy around. 10:38: Trump is asked about an instance where someone told him he was wrong and he listened to them. He says his wife tells him he is wrong all the time and he listens to her. Trump says he has hired a lot of great advisers for his company. He mentions that he is   his campaign while people like Jeb have spent millions of their money (points to the special interests in the audience). Trump says sometimes the experts, even those he hires, are also wrong. Dickerson asks Trump about profanity. Trump says he uses profanity to highlight certain issues. Trump says he was a great student and “not using profanity is very easy. ” He says he won’t do it again. 10:37: Kasich is asked about his comments about how he should be running in the Democratic primary. He is asked how that would win him a GOP nomination. Kasich talks about his having supported policies that grew the economy twice and he can do it again. He talks about   Democrats like his father who think he is a uniter and has the experience and can give people hope. He says   Democrats “will vote for us come next fall. ” 10:33: Carson says so many people have said to him that he needs to scream and jump up and down like everybody else. Carson says that is not what Americans need. He says when he looked under the hood of Washington, his first inclination was to run away and Carson says “we cannot afford to lose this election” and tear each other down after Scalia’s death. Dickerson asks Carson about political correctness. He wants Carson to tell voters something that is not politically incorrect. He says people need to know that free college is a   especially because we are on the verge of economic collapse. 10:31: The moderators let Rubio talk about whatever he wants.. and he talks about poverty. He says   programs have become a lifestyle and he says “poverty is free enterprise not reaching people. ” Rubio says there need to be more state programs to cure poverty because Haley would do better combating poverty than Obama. Dickerson asks Rubio why he didn’t list “immigration reform” as one of his accomplishments in the Senate. Rubio says he couldn’t have mentioned it because it didn’t pass. What a dumb question. [Dickerson is just a mess as a moderator. Overrated and doesn’t understand the concerns of the conservative primary electorate. Seems like a clueless school headmaster who takes himself way too seriously[. 10:23: Dickerson says president have to be firm and flexible. He says Trump has changed his mind on   Clinton. He asks why Trump is like Reagan for changing his mind while Cruz isn’t for changing his mind on immigration. Trump says Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat and became a great conservative president. Trump says he feels that he is a conservative. He says he is a commonsense conservative and says he disagrees with conservatives on eminent domain, which Trump says is something that we need very strongly. Bizarre answer here by someone who seems to lack a team that understands debate strategy. Jeb says he would disagree with his brother re: eminent domain. And he says eminent domain should not be used to benefit  . [Bush’s eminent domain exchange with Trump in New Hampshire was one of his stronger moments and is one of the reasons why he surged at the end] Cruz says Trump is an “amazing entertainer” and Trump’s policies have been mostly liberal. He says Trump has been for   abortion. Trump says Cruz is one of the single biggest liars for saying Trump supports the federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Trump blasts Cruz for willing to say anything to get elected. He calls Cruz a “nasty” guy and blasts his campaign’s push polls. Trump and Cruz get into a testy exchange re: Planned Parenthood. Trump says Planned Parenthood “does to wonderful things  …     having to do with women’s health” but “not when it comes to abortion. ” Cruz says the reason principle matters is because if Trump is president, he will appoint liberals to the Supreme Court. Trump points out that George W. Bush and Cruz both supported John Roberts, who upheld the constitutionality of Obamacare. Jeb! says Reagan was a conservative governor who didn’t tear down people and instead tore down the Berlin wall. Good answer by Jeb! about how Reagan was a conservative California governor. Cruz says he supported Roberts but he would have nominated J. Michael Luttig. Cruz says since Trump donated to people like Reid and Kerry, he would nominate liberals. 10:19: Garrett asks Trump about where he would derive his power to tax companies that go overseas. Trump says he would build consensus but “consensus means you have to work hard, cajole  …     you have to make deals. ” Trump says that Carrier is moving to Mexico and he would go right now to Carrier and say they will make air conditioners in Mexico but they will get taxed. Trump says that would make Carrier stay in the United States and build air conditioners and he says trade pacts today are no good for the America and the American people. 10:17: Dickerson asks Cruz how he has been a warrior for the poor. Cruz says the people who have been hurt the most in the Obama economy have been the most vulnerable like   single moms, etc. Cruz says we need to bring back “booming economic growth” by supporting small businesses. He speaks about his father’s story and he says he thinks about how all of these issues would have impacted his dad when he was washing dishes. Cruz says had Obamacare been around then, his dad would have been laid off or had his hours reduced. 10:15: Carson is asked about whether Wall Street executives should be held responsible for crashes. Carson says regulatory agencies should be trimmed instead of targeting people who are trying to increase the economic viability of our society. Carson says when you consider how much regulations cost American each year, if you want to get rid of poverty, get rid of all the regulations. 10:14: Kasich: Legalization for Illegals in First 100 Days. Kasich says Republicans are going to lose the election to Hillary with all the infighting. He says all the negative ads should be taken down. Kasich says he is for closing the border and for   programs. He says if illegal immigrants have not committed crimes, they should get a path to legalization —  never citizenship —  after paying back taxes, etc. He says he would send his immigration plan to Congress in his first 100 days. 10:12: Trump says that when he announced that he was running for president, illegal immigration wasn’t even a subject. Trump says that the weakest person on this stage on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush. “He is so weak on illegal immigration that it’s laughable, and everybody knows it,” Trump says. Bush says it is “weak” to   women, Hispanics and the disabled. He blasts Trump for his comments re: McCain. Trump calls Bush out for his comments in New Hampshire about how he could moon the audience and the press wouldn’t notice. 10:10: Garrett asks Jeb about his “act of love” comments. Jeb says he needs to channel his inner Chris Christie and blast   for arguing about the inner details of a bill that did not pass. Bush says a great majority of people come to this country because “they have no other choice. ” Bush says they are not all rapists and we should “show a little more respect” for the fact that they are struggling. 10:05: Ted Cruz Calls Out Donor Class in Audience for Booing Him When He Refers to the Gang of Eight’s Amnesty Plan as the “  Amnesty’ Plan. Strassel, from the   borders Wall Street Journal, asks Cruz about his promise to deport illegal immigrants and reverse Obama’s executive amnesty. He says Cruz would have the names of those who registered for Obama’s executive amnesty and she asks if he would use that list to deport illegal immigrants. He says there are “sharp differences” on stage re: amnesty. He says voters have been burned by candidates who have given campaign speeches against amnesty. He points out that he stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King against the Gang of Eight’s amnesty plan. He says Reagan would call that a “time for choosing. ” When Cruz refers to the Gang of Eight’s amnesty plan as the “  amnesty plan,” the crowd boos. Cruz points out that the donor class that supports Rubio hates it and that is why they booed. The crowd cheers Rubio when he says Cruz is now a passionate opponent of amnesty when he supported an increase in green cards, etc. Rubio says Cruz is not a “purist” on amnesty. Cruz says the lines are clear. He says Rubio supports citizenship for all of the illegal immigrants and he opposes it. The   donors in the crowd boo Cruz when he calls Rubio out for going on Univision and saying in Spanish that he would not repeal Obama’s executive amnesty. Rubio quips that he doesn’t know how Cruz could have understood what he said on Univision since Cruz doesn’t speak Spanish. Cruz points out that Sessions has said that without Cruz, the   amnesty bill would have passed. 10:02: Rubio, the Face of the Gang of Eight’s Comprehensive Amnesty Bill, Claims he has ‘Never’ Supported Amnesty. Rubio is asked to defined amnesty. He says it is the “”forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence. ” “I’ve never supported that. I do not support that,” he says. “I think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws. ” He goes into his talking points about not being able to get a comprehensive amnesty legislation passed until the American people are assured that illegal immigration is under control once and for all. Again, the crowd seems to be stacked with   lobbyists who are cheering everything he says. 10:00: Dickerson asks Trump what a “human solution to those who live in the shadows” means. Trump says we “have no border, we have no control” and we have to take care of “our people. ” Trump says he will build a wall and it will be paid for by Mexico. He says “we’re not being treated properly” and “we don’t have a country” without borders. “We have to take care of our people,” he says. 9:55: Carson says his tax plan has been praised by Cato, WSJ, Forbes as the most   tax plan. He says it is based on “real fairness for everybody. ” He says even people below the 150% poverty level have to pay something because everybody has to have some skin in the game. He says his main goal is to get rid of Obamacare and put the care back in patients. 9:53: Bush is asked about his plans to raise taxes on hedge fund managers. Bush says it is not appropriate for hedge fund managers to pay capital gains treatment. He says we need to reform the tax code to simplify the rates and shift power away from D. C. He says Florida led the nation in job growth 7 of his 8 years as governor because of his  tax cuts. 9:51: Bush admires that Kasich is spending more money on   health programs but he points out that Kasich is expanding Obamacare. He says we should be fighting and repealing Obamacare. Bush says he made the case against expanding Obamacare as a private citizen. Kasich says that when Bush was governor, his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as his in his first four years. Kasich says that Ronald Reagan expanded Medicaid five times. Bush says South Carolinians need to know that Kasich is ranked at the bottom and Nikki Haley is at the top in the Cato Institute’s ratings of governors re: fiscal conservatism. Kasich says the people of South Carolina and America want to see unity and he is going to stay positive about what he wants to do. 9:50: Strassel ask Kasich about his Medicaid programs and he says when he expanded Medicaid and treated the mentally ill, they didn’t live under a bridge. He says his state saved money by treating   citizens to end the revolving door.. He says he cut taxes by more than any governor in America. Ohio’s   are strong and Kasich says his state is leaving no one behind. 9:48: Strassel asks Rubio about his tax plan. Rubio claims his tax plan is not trying to use the tax code to influence social policy. He says his tax plan creates a child tax credit for working families so parents can keep more of their money. Audience stacked with   allies cheer wildly again. He says the family is the “most important institution in society” and you cannot have a strong country without strong families. 9:45: Cruz is asked the value added tax. Cruz says that the middle class has been left behind in the Obama economy and we’ve got to bring jobs back, get people back to work, get wages up again, and get people to move from   work to   work. He says this is not going to be solved by magic pixie dust and we have to understand the principles that made America great. Cruz describes his “flat an fair” tax plan that will abolish the IRS because Americans will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard. Garrett pushes Cruz on the VAT and he says his business flat tax is not a   VAT that is a sales tax. He says one of the things that is critical is that his plan abolishes the IRS, corporate income tax, payroll tax, and the death tax. 9:43: Strassel asks Trump about his comments about not wanting to touch entitlements. She asks him if he is proposing more than he can deliver. Trump says he wants to save Social Security and bring jobs back from China, Mexico, Japan. Trump says he is lowering taxes and talks bout how China bought the Chicago Stock Exchange this week. He blasts Nabisco, Ford for moving to Mexico. He says “we have to make our economy grow again  …     this country is dying and our workers are losing their jobs. ” He says he is the only one who will save Social Security. Trump says there is tremendous “waste, fraud, and abuse” and he’ll take care of it. He says there are thousands of people who don’t exist who are “over 106″  …     and says people paid into Social Security and he is not going to cut their benefits. 9:40: Dickerson asks Carson whether a nice person can be tough on terror. He asks Carson about civilian casualties in the war on terror. Carson says he was not in favor of America going to war in Iraq because he has studied the Middle East and those are nations that are ruled by dictators and when you remove one of the dictators, you are going to have chaos without an appropriate plan. Carson blasts the Obama administration for its “asinine thinking” for not wanting to bomb tankers because there may be some environmental damage or people in them. 9:39: Rubio says he thanks God that it was George W. Bush in the White House on   and not Al Gore. Trump wants to know how Bush kept us safe when the World Trade Centers came down while Bush was president. More boos from the crowd. Rubio says the Trade Centers came down because Bill Clinton didn’t kill Osama bin Laden when he had a chance to do so and the    crowd goes wild. 9:38: Kasich says “this is nuts. ” Kasich says we got involved in a civil war and points out Iraq’s borders were drawn by westerners after WWI who had no clue what was going on. He says America should not get involved in civil wars. He says America should not be the world’s police. 9:37: Jeb says he is sick and tired of Barack Obama for blaming his brother for all of the country’s problem. Jeb says he is sick and tired of Trump going after his family. He says his dad is the greatest person alive and his brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe while Trump was building a reality tv empire. Trump points out that the Trade Centers fell while Bush was in the White House. 9:34: Dickerson asks Trump about George W. Bush, who will campaign for Jeb! on Monday. Dickerson asks Trump whether he think Bush should have been impeached for going to war in Iraq. Trump says because he is   his campaign, he doesn’t have lobbyist allies in the audience. He says it was his responsibility to his businesses to get along with everybody. He says the Iraq war is a “big, fat mistake. ” He says it took Jeb! five days at the start of the campaign to say his brother’s war was a mistake. Trump said Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction when his administration knew there weren’t any. 9:30: Dickerson wonders why Cruz doesn’t have a ground component to his Middle East plan. Cruz says the single greatest threat we face is the threat of a nuclear Iran. He says he has promised to “rip to shreds” the Iran nuclear deal. He says one of problems of  ’s foreign policy is it focuses on issues like   unrelated to protecting our country and it ultimately undermines our national security. Dickerson asks Cruz about whether he is putting too much faith in the Kurds and he says they are winning victories and fighting ISIS right now. Cruz criticizes Obama for refusing to arm the Kurds and says if we need to embed special forces to defeat ISIS, we should use them but we ought to start with using our   advantage. He says “we’re not using the tools we have” because Obama “is not focused on defeating the enemy. ” 9:29: Dickerson asks Trump about Putin. Trump says he likes Putin because he called him a genius. Trump is booed when he says “Jeb is so wrong. ” He says that’s Jeb’s special interests and lobbyists booing him. Trump says you can’t fight two wars at one time and we have to defeat the ISIS animals first. Trump says we have spent $5 trillion in the Middle East and have not won with thinking like Bush’s. He slams Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) and gets booed again by the crowd. Bush reiterates that Russia is attacking the troops that America is supporting and Trump says we have “no idea” who the troops we are supporting are. Bush says Trump gets his military advice from the “shows” and is trying to “insult his way to the nomination. ” 9:28: Jeb says we need to defeat ISIS and then dispose of Assad. Bush says Russia is attacking our team and says Trump is “ludicrous” for suggesting that Russia can be a positive partner. Jeb says he would restore the military, have a strategy to destroy ISIS, and immediately create a policy of containment re: Iran if he were president. Breitbart’s Joel Pollak:  Trump: Senate Must ‘Delay, Delay, Delay’ Scalia Replacement, 9:23: Dickerson notes that Carson has had more 2 a. m. phone calls than anyone on stage. Dickerson wonders if Carson’s lack of political experience would be a liability. Carson says “thank you for including me in the debate. ” He says the 2 a. m. phone calls require judgment and the kinds of things you come up with are very, very difficult and unique. He says he was known for doing things that had not been done before. He says no amount of experience prepares you for doing something that has not been done before and that’s where judgment matters. 9:21: Rubio is asked the same question. He says he would want to know about the   region, the Middle East (  conflict) and rebuilding NATO in the European theater. Dickerson asks Rubio what he can point to in his past to show voters that he has been tested. Rubio says that in 2014, Obama would not take military action against Assad in Syria unless it was authorized by the Senate. He says he saw images of children being gassed and then looked at Obama’s plan and concluded that attacking Syria would make the situation worse by allowing Assad to stand up to America and strengthen his grip. He said his decision against Obama’s desire to use force was the right decision. 9:17: Dickerson asks Trump about national security. What three questions would he ask his advisers. He says “what we want to do, when we want to do it” and “how hard do we want to it” because we have to knock out ISIS. Trump says we have to learn who our true allies are. He says we spend billions of dollars supporting people who may not be our allies. Trump says the Iran Deal is a “disgrace” and one of the worst deals he has ever seen in his life. “A disgrace and an embarrassment,” he says. Trump says we have to rebuild America and says he is the only one on the stage said America should not go into Iraq. He says the Middle East got destabilized just like he said. Trump says he said four years ago to attack and keep the oil and points out they just started that a couple months ago. 9:14: Dickerson now turns to Cruz about whether Obama should nominate Scalia’s replacement. Cruz calls Scalia a “legal giant” who was someone who was “faithful to the Constitution” and “changed the arc” of legal history. Cruz says “we are one Justice away” from striking down abortion restriction, striking down Heller, undermining religious liberties. He says the Senate needs to stand strong against Obama’s potential nomination. He says the people of South Carolina must determine who on this stage has the background and the spine to appoint principles constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. He and Dickerson had a testy exchange about when Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed. [The Supreme Court discussion is more proof for why conservative moderators are needed at the debate and not mainstream media moderators who are not fluent in conservatism and what animates the discussion on the right: judges] 9:13: Jeb says he would not have a litmus test for Supreme Court Justices and he’ll nominate someone with a “proven conservative record. ” He says someone, like Scalia, who is a “lover of liberty” and a “believer of limited government” should be nominated. He says we sometimes get surprised (like his dad with Souter) when we pick someone without a long record. 9:11: Rubio again doesn’t answer the question about Senate filibusters and goes on to talk about how Scalia consistently defended the original meaning of the Constitution. He says Scalia understood that better than “anyone in the history of the republic. ” He says it’s been over 80 years since a   president has appointed a Supreme Court Justice and Obama should not be able to appoint Scalia’s replacement. He points out how consequential this election is for the Supreme Court. Dickerson asks Rubio about filibuster reform and he says if Republicans were not in control of the Senate, Obama would ram liberal Justices down their throats. 9:09: Carson says the Constitution doesn’t address this situation. And he speaks about looking into lifetime appointments. Carson says we need to start thinking about the divisions that are going on int he country and he talks about the “truly nasty” remarks that people made after Scalia’s death. He says Obama is not going to heal the country and we should not allow a Justice to be appointed during his presidency. 9:08: Kasich says the country would not be as divided if he were president. Kasich says the country is so divided and we’re going to see another partisan fight take place. Kasich says Obama should nominate someone who could be unaminously be approved. Kasich says the next president should decide who should be on the Supreme Court with the vote of the American people. 9:06: Dickerson asks Trump about Scalia. He asks Trump if it would be an “abdication” to conservative not to nominate a justice if he were a conservative. Trump says he would try to nominate a Justice if he were president and he is absolutely sure Obama will try to as well. He says Scalia’s death is a “tremendous blow” to conservatism and the country. Trump says it’s up to Mitch McConnell to stop Obama from nominating a Justice. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” Trump says. 9:05: Dickerson introduces   Major Garrett and Kimberley Strassel of the Wall Street Journal. Moment of Silence for Justice Scalia: 9:02: Dickerson points out that Justice Scalia, the   member of the court, died today. Dickerson describes him as a “brilliant legal scholar” and the court’s “leading conservative. ” He asks for a moment of silence for Scalia. 9:01 PM EST: The candidates take the stage and Dickerson introduces them. There are no mishaps like in last week’s debate.</td>\n",

       "        <td> (CNN) Warning: This story contains graphic language. Donald Trump engaged in crude and demeaning conversations about women over a    with radio   Howard Stern, according to a review by CNN’s KFile of hours of newly uncovered audio. Among the topics Trump discussed: his daughter Ivanka’s physique, having sex with women on their menstrual cycles, threesomes, and checking out of a relationship with women after they turn 35.  Trump’s long track record of making misogynistic comments and engaging in lewd conversations about sex took on a new and much darker tone on Friday night, when the Washington Post published audio of Trump, caught on a hot mic in 2005, bragging about how women let him do whatever he wants to them because he’s a celebrity. While Trump’s comments  —   in which he describes forcing himself upon women  —   stand apart from anything he has said in the past, Trump has long engaged in sexually explicit banter over the years, particularly on Stern. Trump appeared on Stern’s radio program for decades, and while many of his appearances have been reported on, KFile’s review has turned up previously unreported examples of Trump engaging in crude conversations.  On Ivanka Trump’s physique, In more than one interview with Stern, Trump took part in conversations about Ivanka Trump’s appearance, including one about the size of her breasts. In an October 2006 interview, Stern remarks that Ivanka ”looks more voluptuous than ever,” and asked if she had gotten breast implants. Trump is willing to engage in the discussion about his own daughter, telling Stern that she did not get implants.  ”She’s actually always been very voluptuous,” Trump responds. ”She’s tall, she’s almost 6 feet tall and she’s been, she’s an amazing beauty.” In another interview, from September 2004, Stern asks Trump if he can call Ivanka ”a piece of ass,” to which Trump responds in the affirmative.  ”My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka,” says Trump. ”By the way, your daughter,” says Stern.  ”She’s beautiful,” responds Trump.  ”Can I say this? A piece of ass,” Stern responds.  ”Yeah,” says Trump.  On women’s ages, In his interviews with Stern, Trump discussed leaving women after a certain age and dating younger women.   In a 2002 appearance, Trump calls 30 ”a perfect age.” ”Until she’s 35,” a   interjects. ”What is it at 35? It’s called   time,” Trump responds.  In a 2006 interview, Stern asks Trump, ”Do you think you could now be banging   ?” ”Oh, absolutely,” Trump says.  ”Would you do it? ,” asks Stern.  ”I’d have no problem,” Trump said. Stern then asked Trump if he has an age limit.  ”No, I have no age  —   I mean, I have age limit. I don’t want to be like Congressman Foley, with, you know,   .” On his own sex life, Trump frequently talked about his personal sex life on Stern’s radio program, which included him willingly engaging in a discussion about having sex with women on their menstrual cycles.  ”Will you have sex with a woman if she’s having her period? Go ahead,” Stern asks Trump in a 1997 interview.  ”I thought he was looking at Kate when he said that,” Trump responded, looking at his ”Art of Comeback”   and fellow guest Kate Bohner. ”She’s done that.” ”Donald, seriously, you would not, right, am I correct? ,” asked Stern. ”Well, I’ve been there. I have been there Howard, as we all have,” Trump responded.  ”You don’t like it? ,” asked Stern. ”Well, sometimes you get there by mistake,” Trump said. In the same interview, Stern also asked Trump,  ”Have you had a black women in bed?” ”Well, it depends on what your definition of black is,” responded Trump.  ”Interesting. I like this discussion. His bed is a rainbow,” Stern said.  ”The rainbow coalition, as Rev. Jesse would say,” Trump said.  Later in the interview, Trump says he lost his virginity at ”about 14.” ”It was a young woman, who was really beautiful, she the hot little girl in high school or grammar school or whatever,” Trump said. ”She was hot. I haven’t seen her. I haven’t seen her.” In a 2008 interview, Trump said he was still having ”a lot” of sex with his wife Melania.  Later, when   Artie Lang asked Trump if he ever had a threesome    describing multiple women together weighing 300 pounds    Trump willingly responds in the affirmative, and actually suggests he has slept with three women collectively weighing 375 pounds.  ”I wouldn’t say 300, I would say could be about 375,” said Trump.  ”I figure 125 a piece as opposed to 100.” ”Haven’t we all,” Trump added about men having threesomes, ”are we babies?” In an 1993 appearance, Stern and Trump discussed wealthy men who cannot get dates, when Stern says the difference with Trump is that he satisfies the women he sleeps with.  ”And I couldn’t care less,” Trump replied. On Tiger Woods, In an April 2010 show, Trump engaged in a discussion on the marital infidelities of   Tiger Woods. In the discussion, Trump engaged in extremely explicit discussions with Stern on Woods’s sexual habits. ”Do you believe in sex addiction?” Stern asked Trump during a discussion of Woods and his   Elin Nordegren.  ”No, I believe people like sex a lot,” Trump said. ”People like you, people like me. Tiger.” Asked if he ever slept with two or three women in one day, Trump responds, ”I have no comment. Look, I like sex, so do you.” ”She’s hot, she’s hot though right? ,” Stern asked Trump of Nordegren, after Trump said he’s talked to Woods since his sex scandal broke in the news. ’Yeah, she’s fine,” said Trump. ”You don’t think she’s that hot? ,” Stern asked. ”It depends by what standard,” Trump replied. ”What standard are you judging?” ”I have a very high standard,” added Trump. ”Howard knows, because he got me in a lot of trouble once, he went over a list of 15 supermodels. You remember the list of supermodels. And he’d ask me, ’how was she?’ How was she?’ And I was married at the time, you know this was not a good question to be asking.” ”I think she’s good,” Trump added of Nordegren’s attractiveness. ”No, I’d say she’s a solid nine, solid nine yeah,” Trump said, when asked how he’d rate her. When Stern suggested to him he should do a show where he just rates women, Trump said, ”That may be the best idea of all I would say I’m the   judge, don’t forget, I own the Miss Universe pageant.” ”Mr. Trump I’m asking you directly, is her ass too big?” Stern asked. ”No,” Trump replied. ”Body perfect?” Stern asked.  ”Very nice,” responded Trump. ”She’s very nice, is she a 10, you know what a 10 is?” Trump asked. Stern then brought up one of Woods’s mistresses, saying, ”She does a position where Tiger Woods —   I’m gonna be a little bit graphic —   Tiger stood her on her head    listen to this. ..” ”Spun her around,” Trump interjected while laughing. ”No, no, no,” said Stern. ”He put his penis in her behind and then put his fingers in the vagina. ..” Trump responded by laughing, saying he’s never done that position. Trump added that Woods is definitely ”not gay.” On beauty pageant contestants, In an April 2005 episode, Stern asked Trump if there was ever a time when he had sex with Miss Universe or Miss USA contestants. ”I never comment on things like that,” Trump answered. Later, Artie Lang interjects from the background, ”Give us the first letter of the country you had sex with.” ”How many letters are there?” Trump joked.  Stern then posed a scenario wherein one of the beauty pageant contestants went up to Trump and asked to have sex with him. ”Now you’re not the type that would say no,” Stern said. ”I don’t want to hurt their feelings,” Trump replied.   Robin Quivers then asked Trump if sleeping with the contestants could be construed as a conflict of interest.  ”It could be a conflict of interest,” Trump said. ”But, you know, it’s the kind of thing you worry about later, you tend to think about the conflict a little bit later on.” Stern then put on a fake foreign accent, saying that ”some of these foreign girls” say hello ”with vagina.” ”Well, what you could also say is that, as the owner of the pageant, it’s your obligation to do that,” Trump said, before discussing how he got away with going backstage when the contestants were naked.  ”Well, I’ll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I’ll go backstage and everyone’s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it,” Trump said. ”You know, I’m inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good.” ”You know, the dresses. ’Is everyone okay?’ You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. ’Is everybody okay?’ And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. But no, I’ve been very good,” he added. Later in the episode, Stern asks Trump to assure his audience that ”the chicks will be almost naked” at his pageant, saying to Trump that before he bought the contest, ”they were starting to take women who were educated over women who were hot.” ”They had a person who was extremely proud that a number of the women had become doctors,” Trump explained. ”And I wasn’t interested.” He continued, ”I actually went on the ’Today Show’ with Katie Couric a while ago, six years ago, and we had a woman running the pageant who was really into the whole thing of education and everything and I said, ’Look, if you’re looking for a rocket scientist, don’t turn in tonight. But if you’re looking for a really beautiful woman, you should watch. ’” Stern approved of Trump’s approach, saying, ”I’d rather have a retarded hot woman than a slob who’s a doctor.” In a July 2008 appearance, Trump said he got a case of the ”the shakes,” when it was said Miss Universe would be held in Vietnam. ”The contest of all places was in Vietnam, which was very nice, I got a case of the shakes,” Trump said. ”It was in Vietnam. Vietnam’s a hot country. But, you know, when I was going to high school, when I was going to college Vietnam was like the big deal. Like you have to leave college and go fight   . And I said, ’excuse me?’ Now I’m going to Vietnam for a beauty pageant.” On Paula Jones, In a 2002 episode, Trump discussed the celebrity boxing match of Paula Jones, who in the 1990s accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment. ”It was interesting. That Paula Jones fight, she was not very talented. That was pretty pathetic,” Trump said.  ”It’s funny because Paula Jones would get hit, she’d run,” Robin Quivers said.  ”She would run, it’s too bad she didn’t run like that from Bill (Clinton),” Trump replied.  On infidelity  In a 1993 interview, Trump and Stern engaged in a conversation about fidelity in marriage, with Stern relaying how Trump was shocked when he told him that he doesn’t cheat on his wife. ”Donald asked me during the commercials  —   and I don’t think you mind me saying it  —   he says to me, ’so you don’t get it on with anybody? ,” Stern says. ”I said ’I’m really faithful to my wife’ and he goes ’you’re kidding? Really? What’s that all about?’ ”I can say to Howard’s wife, that’s true,” Trump responds. ”He did say that to me. It’s great.”  Trump adds, ”I was actually faithful to my wife for many years, until I realized the marriage wasn’t gonna work.” Later in the interview, Trump complained about his   Ivana’s accent   ”The funny thing about Ivana is the accent got worse as she grew older, and some people said she wanted it to happen. The accent actually became more pronounced as years went by,” Trump said.  ”It was like the Chinese torture. You know, the water drops on your head,” Trump said.  </td>\n",

I asked someone involved in the   effortto rank the Republican panic on a scale of one to ten, and he said 11. But harnessing that panic requires politicians and party regulars to organize themselves quickly, and there’s no leader in this effort. It requires them to take a big risk.

She says that to say that Trump is not unifying the party is bogus when he won states like Massachusetts and Alabama with two different demographics. She says Trump has surrounded himself with a great team, takes in a lot of information, and makes his own decision after processing all of it. She says that’s exactly what people should want in an executive.

In the Super Tuesday contests that took place this week, Trump won seven of 11 states. “What usually happens right now is the party rallies behind the presumptive nominee,” Fehrnstrom said. “I suspect that will happen, but it looks like the process will take itself a bit longer to work out. ” 2:17: According to Josh Newby, Floridians, especially in Pensacola, are excited about Trump, according to Pensacola Magazine editor Josh Newby.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2016,  12:36  —   Via Politico, Democrat strategists say Hillary could be underestimating Trump: It’s time to stop pointing and laughing at the Republican primary. For all the GOP  ’s flaws, many veteran Democrats are beginning to conclude, Donald Trump is a canny operator who just might end up in the White House if they’re not careful. He appears to be cracking the code with white   voters who could help him put blue Rust Belt states in play against Hillary Clinton. He’s helping to fuel record turnout in GOP primaries and he’s mastered the media like no candidate in recent memory, with his constant feeding of catnip to cable TV and his   missiles on Twitter. “It’s fair to say there’s been a graveyard already out there of people underestimating him,” said Doug Sosnik, a former Bill Clinton White House adviser. “And I am old enough to remember the sort of Democratic intelligentsia that was hoping Ronald Reagan would be nominated by Republicans in 1980 because everyone knew he was a doddering old right winger who could never get elected president. ” “So there is some danger to underestimating his candidacy,” Sosnik said. “Having said that, I have enough confidence in the judgment of the American people to never elect someone like Donald Trump president of the United States. ” 12:30  —   Kasich misses an event in Michigan: Kasich misses MI town hall after plane troubles.

He says they have no documentation and he is for a temporary ban until we figure out what is going on. Trump says we can’t be the police of the entire world and seems to suggest that he is willing to let South Korea and Japan become nuclear powers to defend themselves against the North Korean “maniac” if they don’t pay their fair share for their defense. Trump says Saudi Arabia “would not be there” if we don’t protect them. He also says China has “no respect” for the United States by building military facilities in the South China Sea. 5:45: Trump tells Wolf Blitzer that he would not bail out Puerto Rico.

Gloria Borger rightfully points out on that Clinton is sounding exactly like Jeb Bush (Americans are probably thanking Trump for saving them from a Clinton v. Jeb! snoozefest). 2:36: Flashback: John McCain repeatedly said Americans needed a “steady hand at the tiller” in his campaign against Obama. Voters wanted change instead in 2008. 2:28: Clinton says she is not calling herself the “presumptive nominee” and says she has a lot of empathy for Sanders because against Obama in 2012, she won nine of the last 12 contest but could not close the gap in pledged delegates. She says the gap between her and Sanders is far wider than it was between Obama and her in 2008. 2:27: “Not that I recall,” Clinton says when asked if Trump asked her for favors after he donated to her Senate campaign. 2:25: Cooper says Democrats are wondering if Clinton is ready to run a campaign against Trump (he references Trump’s remarks about her  ) and Clinton nervously laughs. She then talks like a robotic politician and says “if Trump wants to go back to the playbook of the 1990s” and “follow in the footsteps of those who have tried to knock me down and take me out of the political arena, I’m more than happy to have him do that. ” She says she is ready and says  “this is to me a classic case of a blistering, bullying guy who has knocked out of the way all of the Republicans because they were dumbfounded” and “didn’t know how to deal with him. ” Clinton wants voters to get on the “American team” instead of the “red” or “blue” team. 2:21: “I think Elizabeth Warren is really smart,” Clinton says, when asked if she agrees with Warren’s Tweet that Trump is running a racist, sexist, and xenophobic. She says anyone who has listened to Trump speak can draw that conclusion. When asked if she thinks Trump is a racist, Clinton simply says, “I’m going to let people judge for themselves, but I have the highest regard for Senator Warren. ” 2:20: Clinton slams Trump for demeaning women, degrading people with disabilities, and talking about “keeping Muslims out of the country. ” She insists that she is going to keep running her campaign while Trump can run a “bullying” campaign. 2:18: Clinton says Trump needs to put some “meat on the bones” and she says reporters need to ask Trump some tougher questions. Clinton claims she is for “fair and free trade. ” She hits Trump for saying that “wages are too high. ” 2:17: It’s the economy, stupid. Cooper points out that more Americans trust Trump on the economy than her. “We’ll have to go back and talk about the history,” Clinton says of the 1990s. She says Trump can argue about the “peace and prosperity” in the 1990s and she’s going to talk about the future. 2:16: When asked again if she is ready for Trump, she says she has been in the arena for more than 20 years and insists that she isn’t running against Trump and is running her own campaign. “I have a very clear mission in this campaign,” she says. 2:15: In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Hillary Clinton says that Trump’s nomination seemed “pretty clear for some time. ” She says it didn’t surprise her at all that Trump got the nomination. When asked if she is ready to run against Trump, she says we can’t take a risk on a “loose cannon” like Trump. Clinton says Trump’s advisers will be “scrambling” and slams Trump for his comments about women and climate change.   2:10: Clinton’s campaign account, The Briefing, is gleefully   those in the “GOP Smart Set” who are vowing not to support Trump in the general election: Much to my deep chagrin ( astonishment ~8 months ago) for the 1st time in my life, I will not support the GOP nominee for president.  —   Guy Benson (@guypbenson) May 3, 2016,  “Every.

       "        <td>The future Mrs. Donald J. Trump was puzzled. She had been summoned to a lunch meeting with her    and his lawyer to review a prenuptial agreement. It required that, should the couple split, she return everything  —   cars, furs, rings  —   that Mr. Trump might give her during their marriage. Sensing her sorrow, Mr. Trump apologized, Ivana Trump later testified in a divorce deposition. He said it was his lawyer’s idea. “It is just one of those Roy Cohn numbers,” Mr. Trump told her. The year was 1977, and Mr. Cohn’s reputation was well established. He had been Senator Joseph McCarthy’s   consigliere. He had helped send the Rosenbergs to the electric chair for spying and elect Richard M. Nixon president. Then New York’s most feared lawyer, Mr. Cohn had a client list that ran the gamut from the disreputable to the  : Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, Claus von Bulow, George Steinbrenner. But there was one client who occupied a special place in Roy Cohn’s famously cold heart: Donald J. Trump. For Mr. Cohn, who died of AIDS in 1986, weeks after being disbarred for flagrant ethical violations, Mr. Trump was something of a final project. If Fred Trump got his son’s career started, bringing him into the family business of   rentals in Brooklyn and Queens, Mr. Cohn ushered him across the river and into Manhattan, introducing him to the social and political elite while ferociously defending him against a growing list of enemies. Decades later, Mr. Cohn’s influence on Mr. Trump is unmistakable. Mr. Trump’s wrecking ball of a presidential bid  —   the gleeful smearing of his opponents, the embracing of bluster as brand  —   has been a Roy Cohn number on a grand scale. Mr. Trump’s response to the Orlando massacre, with his ominous warnings of a terrorist attack that could wipe out the country and his conspiratorial suggestions of a Muslim fifth column in the United States, seemed to have been ripped straight out of the Cohn playbook. “I hear Roy in the things he says quite clearly,” said Peter Fraser, who as Mr. Cohn’s lover for the last two years of his life spent a great deal of time with Mr. Trump. “That bravado, and if you say it aggressively and loudly enough, it’s the truth  —   that’s the way Roy used to operate to a degree, and Donald was certainly his apprentice. ” For 13 years, the lawyer who had infamously whispered in McCarthy’s ear whispered in Mr. Trump’s. In the process, Mr. Cohn helped deliver some of Mr. Trump’s signature construction deals, sued the National Football League for conspiring against his client and countersued the federal government  —   for $100 million  —   for damaging the Trump name. One of Mr. Trump’s executives recalled that he kept an     photograph of Mr. Cohn in his office desk, pulling it out to intimidate recalcitrant contractors. The two men spoke as often as five times a day, toasted each other at birthday parties and spent evenings together at Studio 54. And Mr. Cohn turned repeatedly to Mr. Trump  —   one of a small clutch of people who knew he was gay  —   in his hours of need. When a former companion was dying of AIDS, he asked Mr. Trump to find him a place to stay. When he faced disbarment, he summoned Mr. Trump to testify to his character. Mr. Trump says the two became so close that Mr. Cohn, who had no immediate family, sometimes refused to bill him, insisting he could not charge a friend. “Roy was an era,” Mr. Trump said in an interview, reflecting on his years with Mr. Cohn. “They either loved him or couldn’t stand him, which was fine. ” Mr. Trump was asked if this reminded him of anyone. “Yeah,” he answered. “It does, come to think of it. ” The gossip columnist Cindy Adams, who knew everyone, had no idea who he was. “This kid is going to own New York someday,” Mr. Cohn told her, gesturing at a tall   bachelor at a dinner party in the early 1970s. “This is Donald Trump. ” “Yeah, so?” Ms. Adams recalled replying. Mr. Cohn, the son of a prominent New York judge, had taken an uncommon interest in Mr. Trump. The two had met not long before at a private disco called Le Club, and instantly hit it off while discussing a nettlesome obstacle for Mr. Trump. The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department was suing him and his father, accusing them of refusing to rent to black tenants. Mr. Trump told Mr. Cohn that their lawyers were urging them to settle. “Tell them to go to hell and fight the thing in court,’” Mr. Trump later recalled Mr. Cohn advising him. Mr. Trump did just that, with Mr. Cohn as his lawyer. Not only did Mr. Cohn countersue the government for $100 million, he filed a blistering affidavit on Mr. Trump’s behalf, mocking the case. “The Civil Rights Division did not file a lawsuit,” Mr. Cohn wrote. “It slapped together a piece of paper for use as a press release. ” The Trumps ultimately settled the case by agreeing to make apartments available to minority renters, while admitting no wrongdoing. For Mr. Trump, the benefits of his new representation were obvious. Mr. Cohn was one of the most famous and feared lawyers in America. He would later appear on the cover of Esquire beneath an ironic halo, and earn a posthumous parody on “The Simpsons. ” But Mr. Cohn saw something in Mr. Trump, too. “He could sniff out a    Roy could,” said Susan Bell, Mr. Cohn’s longtime secretary. After helping convict the Rosenbergs as a young federal prosecutor and then working in Washington as a top aide to McCarthy, Mr. Cohn had returned to New York, starting a boutique practice in his shabby but elegant townhouse on East 68th Street. The division of labor in the firm was clear. “We called him the rainmaker,” said Michael Rosen, a partner who handled many of the firm’s   cases. “We did all of the grunt work, if grunt work means preparing the case and trying the case. ” Mr. Cohn lived on the third floor, often traipsing downstairs in his bathrobe well after the workday had begun and taking clients upstairs to a small sun porch. The elevator rarely worked. In the winter, the lawyers stuffed towels around the windows to keep out the cold. Parties and business meetings tended to blur, with celebrities like Andy Warhol and Estée Lauder crowding in and spilling out. “That townhouse was a workhorse,” recalled Mr. Trump, a familiar presence there himself. He and Mr. Cohn became social companions, lunching at “21” or spending evenings at Yankee Stadium in the owner’s box of Mr. Steinbrenner, another Cohn client. After Mr. Fraser entered Mr. Cohn’s life, the two were frequent dinner guests at Donald and Ivana’s Trump Tower apartment, with its   murals. They were also regulars at Mr. Trump’s box at the Meadowlands, the home of his sports team, the New Jersey Generals of the   United States Football League. Mr. Cohn was the master of ceremonies at a Trump birthday party at Studio 54 years later, Mr. Trump returned the favor with a birthday toast of his own at a party in the atrium of Trump Tower, joking that Mr. Cohn was more bark than bite. “We just tell the opposition Roy Cohn is representing me, and they get scared,” Mr. Trump said, according to a cousin of Mr. Cohn’s, David L. Marcus, who attended. “He never actually does anything. ” Among the many things Mr. Trump learned from Mr. Cohn during these years was the importance of keeping one’s name in the newspapers. Long before Mr. Trump posed as his own spokesman, passing   tidbits to gossip columnists, Mr. Cohn was known to call in stories about himself to reporters. It was also through Mr. Cohn that Mr. Trump met the political operative who has played a leading, if    role in his campaign: Roger Stone. When Mr. Stone, the roguish former Nixon adviser and master of the political dark arts, came to New York in 1979 to court support for Ronald Reagan’s presidential bid, he arrived with a box of index cards filled with the names of actors and producers. And Roy Cohn. “I made an appointment and I pitched him on Reagan, and he said, ‘You have to meet Donald and Fred Trump,’” Mr. Stone recalled in an interview. Eventually, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Trump became so inseparable that those who could not track down Mr. Cohn knew whom to call. Once, Mr. Cohn chartered a plane with friends, without Mr. Trump, trashing it during a midair party. He refused to pay. So the airline found Mr. Trump, asking if he could help. He called Mr. Cohn, more amused than concerned. “I said, ‘Roy, what are you going to do about this? I mean, you destroyed the plane,’” Mr. Trump recalled. “He said, ‘Eh, we’ll pay them someday. ’” By the time Mr. Trump started getting serious with a Czech model named Ivana Winklmayr, Mr. Cohn had become something of an expert on marriage. “It’s difficult to imagine and admit that the flush of the moment may become the flush of the toilet as the relationship goes down the tubes,” he wrote about the importance of prenuptial agreements in his book “How to Stand Up for Your Rights  —   and Win!” According to “Trump: The Greatest Show on Earth,” a book by the journalist Wayne Barrett, Mr. Cohn advised Mr. Trump against marrying Ms. Winklmayr, but insisted that if he must, there had to be a prenuptial agreement. He would handle it himself. The agreement, completed only weeks before the wedding, did not quantify Mr. Trump’s net worth  —   “impossible to accurately determine due to the illiquid nature of his holdings”  —   and took a bearish view of Mr. Trump’s earning potential and a modest view of his tastes. “Donald’s standard of living is basically simple,” it said, calling Mr. Trump’s preferred lifestyle “neither opulent nor extravagant. ” When the marriage dissolved a few years after Mr. Cohn’s death, Mrs. Trump’s lawyers charged that she had not had proper representation on the prenup. Her initial lawyer had worked for Mr. Cohn on at least one case, and was a frequent passenger on Mr. Cohn’s yacht, the Defiance. The divorce case eventually ended with a settlement. The prenup was just one of many Trump deals, some more conventional than others, in which Mr. Cohn was intimately involved. He used his connections to help Mr. Trump secure zoning variances and tax abatements critical to the construction of the Grand Hyatt Hotel and the Trump Plaza. After one Cohn coup, Mr. Trump rewarded him with a pair of   cuff links and buttons in a Bulgari box. And if Mr. Cohn did not always feel comfortable charging a friend for his services, Mr. Trump was hardly one to put up a fight. “Roy said, ‘I’ll leave it to Donald to give me what he thinks is fair,’” Mr. Fraser recalled of one lengthy Trump tax case in particular. “But, of course, Donald didn’t give him anything. ” Some work would have been difficult to bill. For instance, Mr. Cohn lobbied his friends in the Reagan White House to nominate Mr. Trump’s sister Maryanne Trump Barry to the federal bench. (Questioned last year about this, Mr. Trump said his sister “got the appointment totally on her own merit. ”) “He was a very good lawyer if he wanted to be,” Mr. Trump said in the interview. Asked about Mr. Cohn in 1980, Mr. Trump was more blunt in his assessment: “He’s been vicious to others in his protection of me. ” It started with a cut that would not stop bleeding. Mr. Cohn’s diagnosis came not long after his former companion, Russell Eldridge, had gotten his. Mr. Eldridge had spent most of his final days in a private suite overlooking Central Park in Mr. Trump’s Barbizon Plaza Hotel. Ms. Bell, Mr. Cohn’s secretary, recalled that Mr. Trump’s secretary, Norma Foerderer, had billed Mr. Cohn for the room, and later called to say that Mr. Cohn had not paid. “I said, ‘Guess what, Norma, he’s not going to,’” Ms. Bell said. “And she kind of knew it. ” Mr. Cohn remained in his townhouse. Until the end  —   and even under interrogation by Mike Wallace on “60 Minutes”  —   he insisted that he had liver cancer, not AIDS. He received experimental AZT treatments in Washington and continued working. But his clients could not help but notice that his health was deteriorating. Mr. Trump started gradually moving cases elsewhere, he said, never telling Mr. Cohn why. “There’s no reason to hurt somebody’s feelings,” he said. “He was so weak,” Mr. Trump added. “He was so weakened that he really couldn’t do it. ” Mr. Cohn never spoke about Mr. Trump’s decision, but was plainly crushed, according to Ms. Bell. She remembers it happening not gradually, but “overnight. ” Even as his health was failing, Mr. Cohn, whom government prosecutors had unsuccessfully pursued for decades on charges including conspiracy, bribery and fraud, faced a final indignity: He was facing the prospect of disbarment. Among other offenses, he was charged with coercing a dying multimillionaire client  —   during a   visit to the man’s hospital room  —   to amend his will to make Mr. Cohn an executor of his estate. The hearings were closed to the public. But true to form, Mr. Cohn, riding to the daily proceedings in a red Cadillac convertible, insisted on a spectacle, describing his accusers as “a bunch of   just out to smear me up. ” The prominent figures whom Mr. Cohn summoned to testify on his behalf included Barbara Walters and William F. Buckley Jr. And, of course, Mr. Trump. He described his friend in simple terms. “If I summed it up in one word,” Mr. Trump told the hearing panel, “I think the primary word I’d use is his loyalty. ” Gaunt, frail and besieged, Mr. Cohn nevertheless managed to attend a dinner with Mr. Fraser at    in Palm Beach, Fla. shortly after Mr. Trump purchased the property in late 1985. It was a last glimpse at his final,   project. “I made Trump successful,” he would occasionally boast, according to Mr. Marcus, Mr. Cohn’s cousin, a former journalist who chronicled Mr. Cohn’s last months for Vanity Fair. In June 1986, Mr. Cohn was disbarred for “unethical,” “unprofessional” and “particularly reprehensible” conduct. To this day, Mr. Trump rues the outcome. “They only got him because he was so sick,” Mr. Trump said in the interview. “They wouldn’t have gotten him otherwise. ” During his final days, Mr. Cohn called Mr. Trump, ostensibly for no particular reason. “It was just a call: ‘How are things going? ’” Mr. Trump recalled. “Roy was the kind of guy  —   I don’t think he ever thought he was dying, frankly. ” About a week later, in August 1986, Mr. Trump received another call. Mr. Trump hung up the phone, repeating the news to an associate in his office: Roy Cohn was dead. “I said, ‘Wow, that’s the end of a generation,’” Mr. Trump remembered. “‘That’s the end of an era. ’” Mr. Fraser inherited all of Mr. Cohn’s possessions: the townhouse, his weekend place in Greenwich, Conn. his   his private plane and much more. But the Internal Revenue Service, collecting on Mr. Cohn’s tax debts, confiscated nearly everything. He did get to keep the cuff links Mr. Trump had given Mr. Cohn. Years later, Mr. Fraser had them appraised they were knockoffs, he said. Mr. Fraser soon returned to his native New Zealand, where he now works as a conservationist at the Auckland Zoo. He has not spoken with Mr. Trump since Mr. Cohn’s death, but he has no doubt that if his former lover were still alive, he would be an enthusiastic supporter of the Trump campaign. “Having trained or mentored someone who became president,” he said, “that would have been quite exciting for Roy. ”</td>\n",

       "        <td> (CNN) Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence met Tuesday for the first and only vice presidential debate, and CNN’s Reality Check Team spent the evening analyzing their claims. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate and selected key statements from both candidates, rating them true mostly true true, but misleading false or it’s complicated.  ISIS, Reality Check: Pence claims ISIS has overrun Iraq, By Sonam Vashi, CNN, Pence argued that ”Iraq has been overrun by ISIS.” Really? In June, a top State department official said that ISIS had lost 47% of the territory it had previously controlled in Iraq, and its ranks had been nearly halved from the members it had in 2014.  ”Whereas it once promised lavish pay for recruits, and free services in its ’caliphate,’ it is now slashing pay, cannot provide services, and is facing internal resistance,” Special Presidential Envoy Brett McGurk said in congressional testimony. In the first half of this year, the IHS Conflict Monitor found that ISIS’s territory had shrunk by 12%. And Iraqi forces are about to launch a crucial offensive to retake ISIS’s prize: Mosul. ISIS engulfed Iraq’s second largest city in June 2014, but a long, bloody struggle for control of the city is expected to begin in the coming weeks. While parts of Iraq have been ravaged by ISIS, Pence drastically inflates the group’s control over the country. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Clinton failed to negotiate plan to leave troops in Iraq, By Kevin Liptak, CNN White House producer, Pence accused Hillary Clinton of failing to negotiate an agreement with the Iraqi government allowing US forces to remain in the country past 2011. ”Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a ’Status of Forces’ agreement,” Pence said. ”We removed all our troops from Iraq and ISIS was available to be conjured up in that vacuum and overrun vast areas of Iraq.” Reality Check Quick Takes: Did Pence praise Putin? When President Barack Obama entered office in 2009, he inherited a Status of Forces agreement signed in 2008 by his predecessor, President George W. Bush. That agreement stipulated American troops would leave Iraq by 2011. Obama ran on a pledge to end the Iraq War and vowed to reduce the number of US forces there during his first term. When the agreement neared its expiration, the Obama administration worked to secure a new plan that would have left a residual force of 000 troops in the country (down from more than 150, 000 troops when Obama took office). In negotiations with   Prime Minister Nouri   the US insisted that its troops would be shielded from prosecution in Iraq. Iraqi lawmakers balked, and the two sides couldn’t agree on a pact that would allow US troops to remain. Obama announced in October 2011 that he would withdraw all US troops from the country. (Since then, 000 US troops have returned to the country in what the administration describes as a mission to ”train and assist” Iraqi forces). Pence’s claim that Clinton failed to renegotiate a plan to leave US troops in Iraq is accurate, but he failed to provide the context that the original plan to remove all troops from the country was signed by Obama’s Republican predecessor. He also didn’t note that the agreement failed because of the Iraqi parliament’s unwillingness to provide immunity to US troops. Verdict: True, but misleading. ’Deplorables’ Reality Check: Pence claims Clinton called Trump supporters ”not American” Kevin Liptak, CNN White House producer, Pence lashed out at Clinton for her description of a segment of Donald Trump’s supporters. ”She said that half of our supporters were a ’basket of deplorables,’” Pence claimed. ”She said they were irredeemable. They were not American. I mean, it’s extraordinary.” Pence is quoting Clinton’s remarks from a fundraiser last month, when she told supporters you can ”put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables” and added: ”Some of those folks    they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.” Pence largely quoted Clinton accurately. But his claim she called some of Trump’s supporters are ”not American” doesn’t accurately reflect her sentiment that racism, xenophobia, and Islamaphobia don’t reflect US ideals.  Verdict: True, but misleading. Russia, Reality Check: Kaine claims Trump and Pence praised Putin, By Kate Grise, CNN, Kaine attacked both Trump and Pence for their praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ”You guys love Russia,” Kaine said. ”You both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the President. These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.” At NBC’s ”   Forum” last month, Trump said Putin ”has very strong control over a country,” even if he does not agree with the way the country is governed. ”Now, it’s a very different system, and I don’t happen to like the system,” Trump said. ”Certainly, in that system, he’s a been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.” Pence has made similar comments about Putin’s leadership in Russia when backing up his running mate’s comments. ”I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,” Pence told CNN’s Dana Bash in September. While it is certainly impossible to quantify how much, or even if, Trump or Kaine ”love” Russia, we rate Kaine’s claim that they have praised Putin as a strong leader as true. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Pence says Russia ’reset’ led to invasion of Ukraine, By Kevin Liptak, CNN White House producer, Pence hit Clinton’s record on Russia during Tuesday’s debate. ”Hillary Clinton’s top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian ’reset.’ The Russian reset,” he said. ”After she reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.” When Obama took office in 2009, he embarked upon an attempt to repair US relations around the globe, including in Russia. Clinton attempted to capture that ”reset” in March 2009, when she posed with her Russian counterpart holding a button she thought read ”reset” in Russian (it really read ”overcharged”). Flash forward five years to the beginning of 2014, when Russian troops intervened in Ukraine to quell a popular revolution, and have remained in the Crimea region since. Putin formally announced the annexation of Crimea on March 18, 2014. Pence’s characterization of the flow of events is accurate    Clinton and Obama’s attempted reset came ahead of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, though there were many years between the attempted reset and the invasion. Verdict: Mostly true. Clinton Foundation, Reality Check: Pence on Clinton Foundation receiving donations from foreign governments, By Ryan Browne, CNN, Pence charged that the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments while Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. ”The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign donations from foreign governments while she was secretary of state,” Pence said. The Clinton Foundation did indeed accept millions of dollars from seven foreign governments during Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, according to foundation officials. Although Clinton and the foundation agreed to measures and restrictions on such funding, Clinton Foundation officials admitted that millions of dollars found its way to the foundation. According to The Washington Post, documents provided by the foundation to that newspaper made it ”clear that the 2008 agreement did not prohibit foreign countries with interests before the US government from giving money to the charity closely linked to the secretary of state.” This included a $500, 000 donation from the Algerian government. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Pence on Clinton Foundation’s donations to charity, By Eve Bower, CNN, Pence said that the Clinton Foundation gives ”less than 10 cents on the dollar” to ”charitable causes.” But a recent analysis by independent watchdog CharityWatch found that the Clinton Foundation actually spent 88% of its budget on its charitable programs in 2014. So why the large discrepancy? Pence was likely referring only to the charitable grants the Clinton Foundation has awarded to outside groups, as opposed to the charitable work conducted by the Clinton Foundation’s own programs.  According to Clinton Foundation tax forms    in 2013, for example    the foundation reported total revenue of almost $149 million, and awarded external grants worth a total of nearly $9 million    or about 6 cents on the dollar. But most Clinton Foundation work is implemented by the foundation’s own program staff, and is also considered charitable work. CharityWatch considers any foundation with more than 75% of its expenses in charitable programs to be ”highly efficient.” With 88% the Clinton Foundation meets that standard. Because Pence’s figure failed to account for the total amount of the Clinton Foundation’s charitable work, we rate his claim false. Verdict: False. Social Security, Reality Check: Kaine claims Trump called Social Security a ’Ponzi scheme’ By Amy Gallagher, CNN, ”Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us,” Kaine claimed. In ”The America We Deserve,” published in 2000, Trump wrote about Social Security. ”The truth is undeniable. The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme. The pyramids are made of  .”  In the book, Trump goes on to advocate for the privatization of Social Security, describing it as ”letting people keep the money that is rightfully theirs” and crediting the idea to a retired laundry worker named Oseola McCarty.  During his presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly promised to leave Social Security untouched. ”I’m not going to cut it, and I’m not going to raise ages,” Trump said earlier this year. This stands in contrast to Pence’s views as he has expressed them in the past. As a congressman, he backed a Republican plan that would have allowed workers to divert some funds into private accounts. We rate this claim as true both because it accurately reflects Trump’s words in his book and because Kaine is correct in pointing out that Trump’s past statements about Social Security (and Pence’s) contradict the Trump campaign’s present commitment to leave it untouched. Verdict: True. Economy, Reality Check: Pence on poverty  By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, Pence slammed the Obama administration’s economic record, noting that poverty has increased during his tenure. ”There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama, with Hillary Clinton at his side, stepped into the Oval Office,” he said. It’s true that both the number of people and the rate of poverty increased at the start of the Obama administration, which coincided with the nation’s worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. In 2008, the year before Obama took office, there were 39. 8 million people in poverty and the rate was 13. 2%. Two years later, the rate peaked at 15. 1% and the number of poor people jumped to 46. 3 million. But the improving economy made a big dent in poverty in 2015. The rate fell to 13. 5% the largest decline in decades. The number of Americans in poverty fell to 43. 1 million, down from 46. 7 million the year earlier. Also, experts say it’s more important to look at the poverty rate than the number of people in poverty since the American population is growing. Therefore, we rate Pence’s comment true, but misleading. It’s true that there are millions more in poverty than when Obama took office, but Pence should refer to the rate rather than the number of people in poverty. And he overlooks that fact that both the share and the population declined greatly in 2015. Verdict: True, but misleading. Reality Check: Does Trump want to eliminate the federal minimum wage? By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney, Kaine asserted that ”(Donald Trump) and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.” Trump has changed his tune on the federal minimum wage many times during this campaign. He did seem to support eliminating it when he suggested that states should decide on a minimum wage, not the federal government. At other times, he expressed support for keeping it. In the summer of 2015, he said he thought the minimum wage should stay where it is, at $7. 25 an hour. Then this summer, he advocated for raising it to $10. Verdict: True, but misleading. Reality Check: Pence claims ’We are in the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression’ By Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney, The economy’s recovery from the Great Recession that began in December 2007 is the slowest comeback since World War II. The US economy has only grown 2% a year since it bottomed out in June 2009. That’s slower than the average annual growth of 2. 7% under George W. Bush and well below the 4% growth America often reached in the 1980s and 1990s. Some bright spots: The current recovery has been long    longer than most. Since World War II, the economy has typically grown for about five years and then contracted. This recovery is already seven years old. And as important as overall economic growth is the pace of jobs creation. By that measure, this has been only the   recovery, with 14 million jobs created, beating out the recovery during Bush’s presidency.  Verdict: True. Nuclear proliferation, Reality Check: Kaine on Trump’s stance on nuclear proliferation, By Ryan Browne, CNN, ”Most dangerously, Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons. He’s said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them, Korea should get them. And when he was confronted with this and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here’s what Donald said, and I quote, ’Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves. ’” But has Trump said this? Trump has sent mixed messages on the issue of nuclear proliferation. When asked if he was prepared to accept Japan and South Korea acquiring nuclear weapons, Trump told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, ”I am prepared to . .. if they’re not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and the police for the world. We are, right now, the police for the entire world. We are policing the entire world.” Trump also said in a New York Times interview, ”Well, I think maybe it’s not so bad to have Japan    if Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us.” When talking about tensions with   North Korea with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, he said, ”Now, wouldn’t you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons?”  Cooper also asked Trump if he supported Saudi Arabia’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. Trump initially signaled he did. Cooper asked, ”Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?” to which Trump responded, ”Saudi Arabia, absolutely.” But when Cooper followed up, Trump said, ”No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us.” ”It’s very simple. They’re going to have to defend themselves,” Trump added. Kaine also said that Trump said, ”Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves,” in reference to nuclear war between Japan and North Korea. Trump did indeed tell a rally in Wisconsin, ”Good luck . .. Enjoy yourself, folks.” While not the exact words Kaine referred to, the sentiment and words are very close. Trump has signaled a willingness to accept a   Japan, a departure from decades of American foreign policy, and has to a lesser extent expressed willingness to accept South Korea acquiring its own nuclear weapons. While he did tell Cooper that Saudi Arabia should have them, he immediately changed his stance. Verdict: Mostly true. Debt, Reality Check: Kaine says debt explosion under Trump’s tax plan would be much bigger than under Clinton’s, By Lex Haris and Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney, Kaine said, ”The debt explosion on the Trump plan is much much bigger than anything on the Clinton side.” Trump has proposed slashing taxes, increasing government spending in some areas while cutting it in the smallest parts of the budget. He also vows not to touch Social Security. Trump asserts the economic growth his plan would generate would more than make up for any shortfall in tax collections by the government. Independent analysts disagree. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan think tank, estimates Trump’s plan would add $5. 3 trillion to the national debt in the first decade. In contrast, Clinton has proposed increasing government spending, but also hiking taxes on the wealthy. The result, according to the CRFB, would be a much smaller increase in the national debt    $200 billion. Verdict: True. Trump’s tweets, Reality Check: Clinton campaign on Trump’s tweets, By Lisa Rose, CNN, About 90 minutes before the vice presidential debate, Clinton’s campaign tweeted out a stat that suggests Trump has not been supportive of Pence on Twitter. According to Clinton’s campaign, the Republican presidential nominee has given Pence a tip of the hat in his Twitter feed 21 times. In comparison, according to Clinton’s campaign, Trump has tweeted at Rosie O’Donnell 65 times. The comparison is specious because Trump has been trading barbs with O’Donnell for nearly five years on Twitter, though he hasn’t tweeted about her since May. Trump only started tweeting about Pence in July, when he announced the Indiana governor was his running mate.   The larger problem is drawing a conclusion that Trump is not supportive of Pence simply by counting mentions on Twitter and then bringing the unrelated O’Donnell feud into the mix.  Verdict: False. Taxes, Reality Check: Kaine on Trump and tax returns, By Eve Bower, CNN, Kaine mentioned a 2014 interview Trump gave, saying, ”Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, ’If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes. ’” Pence responded, ”And he will.” Trump did indeed make make such a promise. In May 2014, during a visit to Ireland to promote his hotel and golf course, Trump sat down for an interview with Ireland’s TV3. The reporter, Colette Fitzpatrick, reminded Trump that he had questioned Obama’s citizenship and had said that if Obama presented his   birth certificate, Trump would produce his tax returns.  ”But you didn’t do it, did you?” Fitzpatrick asked. Trump answered, ”Well, I don’t know, did he do it? And I will. If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns. Absolutely.” Obama released his   birth certificate in April 2011    more than three years before Trump’s 2014 interview. But Trump still has not released his tax returns. Kaine accurately remembered Trump’s claim, but Pence did not provide specifics on when those tax returns will be forthcoming. Trump has said that he is not able to release his returns due to an ongoing Internal Revenue Service audit. There is, however, no legal reason why someone under audit cannot make their tax records public while they are running for office. Verdict: True. Trump, Pence on Mexicans, Reality Check: Kaine claims Trump and Pence say ”All Mexicans are bad” By Lisa Rose, CNN, Kaine accused Pence and Trump of denigrating Mexicans en masse.  ”These guys say all Mexicans are bad,” Kaine claimed. While Trump has made a border wall the centerpiece of his campaign, there is no record of him saying that all Mexicans are bad. When the reality star announced he was running for president in June 2015, he did say Mexico sends criminals and troublemakers across the border. He included a qualifier, however. ”When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best . .. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.  And some, I assume, are good people.” Two weeks after the announcement, Trump told CNN’s Don Lemon, ”I love the Mexican People. I’ve had a great relationship with Mexico and the Mexican people.” More recently, when the businessman visited Mexico City in August, he said that   are ”just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular   people. I have such great respect for them and their strong values of family, faith and community.” Kaine said both Trump and Pence have made sweeping statements about all Mexicans but a keyword search on Pence’s name within close proximity to the word ”Mexican” yielded no results in the Nexis. com news database. There aren’t any references to Mexicans in Pence’s Twitter feed. Verdict: False. Trump Foundation, Reality Check: Trump Foundation gave money to attorney general considering case against Trump University, By Amy Gallagher, CNN, In response to accusations by Pence about the Clinton Foundation, Kaine attacked the Trump Foundation: ”(Donald Trump’s) foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.” Kaine then went on to insinuate that the donation may have been   : ”The person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.”  It is true the Trump Foundation did make an illegal contribution and they have admitted as much. A senior member of Trump’s organization called it ”an honest mistake.” It’s also true that the donation was to a political group that supported Pam Bondi, who was running for   as Florida attorney general. Her office had received several claims against the Trump Institute (an organization licensing the Trump name but not owned by Trump) and at least one claim against Trump University (one of Trump’s own companies).  The donation was made after a spokesperson from Bondi’s office told the Orlando Sentinel that they were considering the case. After the $25, 000 donation was received, Bondi did not pursue charges against Trump University. Bondi admits soliciting the donation, but denies her office’s decision was influenced by the money. However, Kaine’s critique is worded well: the donation creates an appearance of impropriety. Although the check didn’t go to Bondi’s campaign per se, we nevertheless rate the claim true because Trump’s foundation did, in fact, issue a check to a political organization which Bondi admits to soliciting and because the payment was made at a time when her office was considering a possible case against one of his companies.  Verdict: True.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Taormina, Italy (CNN) Swinging over the green Ionian sea Saturday, his first foreign trip behind him, President Donald Trump was in a valedictory mood. Behind him, perched on the hillside, was the former Dominican monastery where G7 leaders had just finishing haranguing him to abandon his campaign promises to withdraw from a major climate agreement. He didn’t give in.  Ahead was a crowd of US troops stationed on this rocky Italian outpost, eager to hear their commander in chief reprise the foreign agenda he’d spend the last nine days considering. After nine days of talks with calculating foreign leaders, Trump was eager for the affirmation of an applauding audience. ”We have been gone for a long time,” Trump declared at the Sigonella Air Base here. ”Everywhere I go    we have been gone close to nine days, this will be nine days    I think we hit a home run no matter where we are.” It was an upbeat message for a leader fresh from meeting with his new club of foreign counterparts for the first time. But underneath the    recap of his trip lay uncertainty over his agenda and disputes with his foreign counterparts. Trump’s first voyage abroad was a story told in chapters, each successively less pleasant for a President still taking stock of his standing on the world stage. Beyond a scattering of formal remarks, none of the story was told by Trump himself, who refused to hold a news conference and, by his advisers’ own admission, revealed little of his thinking to top aides as he hopped from nation to nation. Instead, it was a trip told in pictures with the volume on mute. By the time he departed Sicily, Trump had delivered four major addresses but clarified none of the questions that surround his foreign policy. In some ways, uncertainty amounted to a win, at least in the minds of Trump’s aides. As Trump prepared to depart Washington last Friday, there was little surety among his staff that the   odyssey could proceed without failure. Trump himself, who hadn’t slept in a bed that wasn’t his own since taking office, remained skeptical a   itinerary could end well. A homebody with little appetite for discomfort, Trump was imagining the worst. Unpleasant foreign food, withering jet lag, and an unfamiliar bed had been his experiences as a businessman abroad. Even in the days leading up to his departure, Trump asked whether the trip could be truncated. He vented about the ambitious schedule to his senior advisers in the days leading up to his departure. But by then it was too late. With meetings locked in and the world anticipating his global debut, Trump settled into his quarters on Air Force One for a flight four times longer than any he’d taken as President. A king’s welcome, Fourteen hours later, Trump was tucked into the back of his armored limousine, speeding into central Riyadh alongside King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and watching billboards plastered with both their faces whiz past. Any concern about an uneasy   abroad disappeared quickly. Welcomed with horse parades, draped with a gold medal and lured into a   sword dance, Trump had finally found a country to treat him like a king, if only for a weekend. For the first time in his presidency, he was regularly accompanied by the first lady, who consulted with the US State Department before packing her wardrobe and emerged as the unlikely subplot of Trump’s debut on the world stage. Trump’s aides selected the Middle Eastern kingdom as the first stop, partially because the lavish lifestyle lived by its monarchy was bound to be extended to the President. Launching the President’s trip from Saudi Arabia also underscored its critical importance in the eyes of the White House, particularly for    and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who hailed the business deals reached on the trip. Yet an air of naïveté hung in the air after the President’s speech to leaders of more than 50 Muslim majority nations. The White House described it as something of a fait accompli, with a top official twice declaring that the President had ”united the Muslim world.” In truth, Trump had done nothing of the sort, even with his   Riyadh address. Trump’s policy adviser Stephen Miller    whose role writing the speech raised eyebrows    had drafted a conciliatory address that replaced Trump’s ”radical Islamic terror” watchword with the milder ”Islamist extremism.” As Trump delivered his opening argument to a room packed with leaders of Muslim nations, however, the newly sedate language didn’t entirely come through. ”There is still much work to be done,” Trump said. ”That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamic extremism and the Islamists and Islamic terror of all kinds.” The   occurred because the President was exhausted, his advisers later explained, only two days into what would become a   slog through meetings and ceremonies. Terror intrudes, Awaking in Jerusalem two days later to news of a suicide attack in England, Trump found himself confronting at close range the thematic underpinnings of his trip. Huddling with aides in his suite at the storied King David hotel overlooking the old city, the message on extremism he’d delivered in Saudi Arabia    which came with few details    suddenly appeared more difficult. In Israel, a country intimately familiar with the scourge of terror and the entrenched politics of peace, the problem appeared even more insurmountable. Trump was unsatisfied with the language his advisers had prepared for a speech later that morning. The condemnation of the attack lacked verve, Trump believed. Describing the attackers in ordinary terms wouldn’t suffice. Instead he wrote up his own description, using the insult he’s long considered the most cutting. ”I will call them from now on losers because that’s what’s they are. They’re losers,” Trump said a few hours later standing alongside Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ”We’ll have more of them. But they’re losers    just remember that.” The message was well received. But hours later, it was clear Trump faced a steep climb before bridging the gaps that have long stymied American presidents’ attempts at fostering stability in the Middle East. ”I hope this heralds a real change,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ahead of Trump’s remarks at the Israel Museum. ”Because if the attacker had been Palestinian and the victims had been Israeli children, the suicide bomber’s family would have received a stipend from the Palestinian Authority. That’s Palestinian law. That law must be changed.” It was an intrusion of   obstacles into Trump’s vision for peace, which he once deemed easy, but which this week he declared the hardest deal of all. Climate controversy, When the President arrived at the Vatican on a   morning on Wednesday, Pope Francis didn’t lecture Trump. He gently encouraged him to do something else: Read. The Pope presented Trump with a bound copy of his encyclical on protecting the environment, ”Laudato Si: On Care for Our Common Home.” For all the underlying tensions setting the stage for their first visit, given their unusually harsh exchange last year over immigration and whether the building of walls is a Christian thing to do, the Pope took another tack. A skilled politician in his own right, Francis honed in on the President’s pending decision whether to pull the US from the Paris climate accord. It was the first of several conversations Trump conducted this week on the landmark carbon reduction agreement, which he vowed as a candidate to scrap.  Departing the G7, Trump said he would make a decision next week. But to leaders he met with in Sicily, his intentions already seemed clear. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the group held unsatisfactory conversations on the matter. The US refrained from signing onto a joint statement endorsing Paris after the summit closed other leaders said Trump wasn’t prepared to take that step. At the Vatican, though, Trump insisted his mind was open. ”I’ll be reading them,” Trump said of the essays from the Pope on the environment and creating peace. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, weighed in with the direct message urging Trump and his team to stay true to the Paris agreement. The President’s first meeting with Francis was steeped in symbolism, the final stop in visiting the three homes of the Abrahamic religions: Islam, Judaism and Christianity. He’s the second American president to visit the Vatican under Francis’ papacy. While President Barack Obama’s meeting was 20 minutes longer than Trump’s, the Holy See wasted little time comparing the two. As he left the Apostolic Palace, Trump told the Pope: ”I won’t forget what you said.” If he meant climate change, the Pope will have won round one. Selective lecturing, Flying north from Rome, Trump found the temperature quickly cooling. He arrived at NATO’s headquarters on the outskirts of Rome under a cloud of suspicion on multiple fronts. After sensitive British intelligence about the Manchester attack appeared in American media outlets, Prime Minister Theresa May fumed, saying she planned to speak her mind when she met Trump at the meetings. It was the second time a foreign government expressed concern about sharing intelligence with their US counterparts: Trump himself revealed secret information to Russian officials earlier this month that could be traced back to Israel. In one of the only   moments of his trip, Trump declared in Jerusalem that he hadn’t mentioned Israel by name with his Russian visitors. But at NATO, the concerns still boiled. It was just one of the rifts between Trump and his European counterparts. After   welcomes in Riyadh and Jerusalem, Trump’s foreign swing took a distinct tonal shift. Instead of banquets and horses, Trump was suddenly flung into   meetings with leaders deeply skeptical of his foreign agenda. His first talks with newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron began with a lengthy handshake, each man’s face contorted in a forced smile as they gripped each other. Later, a French official revealed Trump asked for Macron’s cell phone number, and tried to insist he didn’t back Macron’s election rival Marine Le Pen, who he referred to only as ”that woman.” Subsequent sessions proceeded similarly. Trump reportedly griped about the hurdles in opening golf courses in Europe with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. European Council President Donald Tusk said after his meeting with Trump that they weren’t able to bridge differences over Russia. At NATO, the mood hadn’t improved. Despite the military bands and a military jet flyover, Trump wasn’t in a conciliatory mood. While he vowed in Riyadh the US would no longer lecture its allies    particularly on human rights    it was a lecture he delivered during an unveiling ceremony at the military alliance’s new building. ”  of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they’re supposed to be paying for their defense,” Trump said as his fellow NATO leaders openly scoffed. ”This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States.  And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years.”   Trump’s message didn’t contain an explicit endorsement of NATO’s collective defense pact    an attack on one is an attack on all    though his aides later insisted the message was implied.  As he mingled at his first major summit of world leaders, it was evident the new member of the exclusive society wasn’t out to make friends. He remained largely isolated during informal talks, speaking intently with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as other leaders huddled around Merkel, the most powerful leader in Europe. When it came time for a   Trump pushed his way past Montenegro’s prime minister to the front. It was a far cry from the display of welcome he’d experienced in Saudi Arabia only five days earlier. And it wasn’t due to improve as he flew to his final stop in Sicily. Russia questions swirl, The   swing through the Middle East and Europe provided momentary relief for a beleaguered Trump, whose presidency reached its most precarious moments in the   week before he departed. Aides had hoped he could escape the Russia controversy briefly while traveling overseas. But by the time Trump arrived at his final stop in Sicily, the probe into Russia’s   meddling had only inched closer to Trump’s inner circle.  As he returns, decisions about hiring lawyers and firing aides loom. Spending his first nights as president away from home, Trump found himself stewing over the latest developments from foreign hotel rooms late into the night. Even with wife, Melania, alongside for the longest stretch of his presidency, Trump was consumed by the story that has deeply sidetracked his agenda. On the rocky hillside where leaders were meeting, the questions about Russia and the controversies back home seemed to merge. Leaders wondered whether Trump    whose campaign was aided by Russian election meddling, according to a US intelligence analysis    could ever be trusted to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russia controversy also prevented Trump from fully embracing what would ordinarily be a crowning moment of his presidency. Unwilling to face questions about the controversy, Trump eschewed any kind of interactions with the press, a setting he otherwise could use to tout his accomplishments abroad. Most other leaders took questions as they departed Taormina, many detailing points of contention with the new US leader. Trump himself offered no view of his side of the encounters nor could he articulate his foreign policy while answering questions about them. Returning to Washington, Trump remained in his cocoon    pleased with himself, but aware the silence won’t last much longer.</td>\n",

       "        <td>On a Sunday morning in early June, Senator Mark Kirk rolled into an uptown Chicago bar in his wheelchair to take part in the city’s 47th annual L. G. B. T. Pride Parade, wearing a red polo shirt, charcoal khakis and the abashed   of a    man who has already assessed his long odds of blending in. He hoisted himself up and made his way into the crowd, leaning on the cane he has used since suffering a severe stroke four years ago. A few young people wearing robin’  blue Equality Illinois   approached him. They shook his hand and thanked him for being one of the few Republican senators to sponsor the Equality Act, which would extend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination against L. G. B. T. people. The encounters tended to be brief, because even in the most favorable circumstances Kirk has always been a somewhat awkward conversationalist. Crowded up against a   woman wearing a rainbow tutu, he offered: “My friend has a    granddaughter who wears nothing but tutus. It’d be good to get her one of those. Good for, er, political purposes. ” On his way out the door, Kirk found his path impeded by another   politician: Representative Tammy Duckworth, his Democratic opponent in November’s election, who lost both of her legs to a grenade as an Army helicopter pilot during the Iraq war. The two wincingly shook hands  —   “Whenever you run into your opponent,” he told me later, “there’s always that fake smile”  —   but said nothing. Out on North Broadway, where the festivities were about to begin, Kirk climbed into the gray Mustang convertible that would ferry him through the parade. Before long, Duckworth materialized nearby. The    congresswoman wore a       several beaded necklaces and a halo of flowers in her hair. “Woo hoo!” she hollered as onlookers called out her name. Meanwhile Kirk  —   a man who is palpably of, by and for the northern suburbs of Chicago  —   sat in the passenger seat of the Mustang and cast a pensive gaze at the gray clouds gathering overhead. Kirk is refreshingly unvarnished as senators go and did not bother pretending to be in the parading spirit. Less than four months before Election Day, the   senator’s own polls have him 3 points behind Duckworth. More than a year ago, Beltway odds makers were already rating Kirk as one of the likeliest to lose among the senators up for   in 2016. Illinois is a resolutely blue state that becomes even more so in a presidential cycle, when black and Hispanic turnout in the Chicago area is especially high the last Republican from the state to hold a United States Senate seat for more than one term was Charles Percy, who left office in 1985. Although Kirk was a congressman for a full decade before winning in 2010 the Senate seat once held by Barack Obama, to this day he lacks a national or even statewide profile. And all of this was before a certain real estate tycoon decided to run for president. In a more ordinary presidential election year, a vulnerable senator like Kirk would be inclined to look to the top of the ticket for campaign support. But what happens when that position is occupied by Donald Trump  —   a candidate who has proposed banning Muslim immigration, has made a seemingly endless series of statements offensive to Hispanics, Jews, blacks and women and, according to Gallup polls, currently enjoys a favorable rating (31 percent) not seen since the nadir of Jimmy Carter’s presidency? The   ticket has prompted gleeful Democrats to coalesce around a   message that will tie every Republican office seeker to the nominee. Meanwhile, Republican leaders like Speaker Paul Ryan and the 2012 presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, have gone to the extreme of repeatedly condemning the behavior of their party’s   implicitly urging Republican candidates to do whatever is necessary to avoid an Election Day apocalypse. The friction between the nominee and his party became jarringly apparent during a   meeting at the Capitol Hill Club on July 7 between Trump and 41 Republican senators. A few of them accused Trump of jeopardizing the party’s prospects in November Trump fired back with insults, labeling Kirk  —   who was not present but has publicly criticized Trump  —   a “loser. ” The meeting was especially charged given the acute vulnerability of the   Senate. The party currently holds a   majority. Of the 34 seats up for   this year, 24 are occupied by Republicans. Six of those, including Kirk’s, are in states to which the Republicans managed to lay claim in the Tea Party tsunami of 2010, but that President Obama won two years later. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, the Democrats need to retake only four of those six to control the Senate (because the vice president gets a Senate vote in the event of a tie). Presidential election years have increasingly brought out   nonwhite voters, so 2016 was sure to be an unpleasant one for Kirk and his Republican colleagues regardless. With Trump, who has disparaged, threatened or otherwise offended many of those same voters in the past year, their collective migraine has become a yearlong cluster headache. “I have to respect the will of the voters,” Kirk said, referring to Trump’s primary victories. “If you win the election, you won the election. ” Still, he added, “In this case, I do disagree with the decision the voters made. ” Last September, as the idea that the Trump candidacy was something more than an ephemeral novelty began to sink in, Ward Baker, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, sent a memo to his senior staff. “Let’s face facts,” Baker wrote. “Trump says what’s on his mind, and that’s a problem. Our candidates will have to spend full time defending him or condemning him if that continues. And that’s a place we never, ever want to be. ” Baker’s   memo, which was leaked to The Washington Post, instructed candidates to “run your own race” and to “show your independence” from the man he described as a “mis guided missile”  —   but at the same time, he cautioned, be mindful of the fact that “Trump has connected with voters on issues like trade with China and America’s broken borders. ” Even eight months before Trump effect ively claimed the nomination, Baker grasped the uniquely fraught terrain the party’s unexpected   had laid out before the Republicans who would be sharing a ticket with him in November. The connection between presidential nominees and     candidates is historically clear, and has become more so as the country has become more polarized. That’s especially the case when it comes to the Senate. With (for the most part) increasing frequency since 1913  —   the year the 17th Amendment was passed, designating that senators would be elected by popular vote rather than by state legislatures  —   voters have tended to elect Senate candidates who belong to the same party as the presidential candidate they favor. Both parties still hold close the memories of the exceptional examples of this phenomenon, the bonanza years and the catastrophes. In 1980, Ronald Reagan’s victory over Carter was the crest of a tidal wave that also gave Republicans 12 Senate seats and control over the upper chamber for the first time in almost three decades. In 1964, Barry Goldwater’s support for “extremism in the defense of liberty” cost Republicans   of both the Senate and the House. But Trump presents a much more complex weather system for his   to navigate than either of these cases. His views are not wedded to a coherent ideological movement within his party (as Goldwater’s were) nor is his unpopularity a simple judgment on his record (as Carter’s was). Instead, Trump is a sui generis figure who must be accepted or rejected on his own terms, not artfully hedged around in the way politicians are accustomed to doing. And while Trump was undoubtedly the most popular Republican primary contestant in a field of 17, it’s still not clear how many of his opponents’ supporters will vote for their party’s pick on Election Day. For an   Republican senator this fall, to back away from Trump is, by extension, to snub his millions of   loyalists, the one group of party voters that is sure to show up on Nov. 8. But to go   for Trump is to take leave of your Republican bona fides and embrace life as a Trump    —   a gamble that not a single Republican senator up for   this fall appears to have the stomach for. None of this seems to overly concern Trump. When I asked him recently whether the party’s maintaining its majority in the Senate meant anything to him, he replied: “Well, I’d like them to do that. But I don’t mind being a free agent, either. ” Trump has shown similarly little interest in helping his party’s committees build the sort of war chests typically required in a campaign year. After winning the presidential nomination on a shoestring budget and with fewer paid staff members than the average candidate for governor, he has been visibly reluctant to help build much in the way of national campaign infrastructure, sending a clear message to his fellow Republicans: This fall, you’re on your own. As Ryan Williams, a strategist with the 2012 Romney presidential campaign, told me: “Traditionally, the nominee has a robust campaign that absorbs the R. N. C. effort and works in tandem with the   campaigns. We did that with Romney in 2012. This time around, there’s a complete void at the presidential level. Trump’s trying to play a game of baseball and hasn’t put out an infield. ” In addition to Kirk, there are five Republican incumbents running in states that Obama won in 2012 whose fortunes are now lashed to those of the Trump campaign: Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Marco Rubio in Florida, Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Rob Portman in Ohio. In May, Ayotte offered her “support” for Trump, but a spokeswoman quickly clarified to reporters that Ayotte “hasn’t and isn’t planning to endorse anyone this cycle. ” Johnson supplied messaging advice to the Trump campaign during the Wisconsin primary in April and declared the day after Trump vanquished Ted Cruz on May 3 that “I am going to certainly endorse the Republican nominee. ” Two weeks later, however, Johnson ratcheted down his endorsement to   “support,” warily adding that he would “be concentrating on the areas of agreement with Mr. Trump. ” Rubio, meanwhile, has remained in a state of   torment ever since his drubbing in the presidential primaries. Before announcing that he would run again for the Senate, Rubio said that he would be “honored” to help his party’s nominee, but later hedged, saying he did not expect to speak at the Republican convention on Trump’s behalf  —   and finally declaring he would not attend the convention at all. “I think that the Senate needs to fulfill its role as a check and balance on the president, no matter who it is,” he said last month. This was clearly intended to suggest that, if   he would not blindly do the bidding of a President Trump  —   a notion that has prompted belittlement from Rubio’s Democratic opponents. “What’s so funny about that premise is that Rubio’s the only Senate candidate we’re running against who has proven he’s ineffective at standing up to Donald Trump,” Sadie Weiner, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s communications director, told me. Toomey and Portman, for their part, have both distanced themselves from, among other things, Trump’s claim that Gonzalo Curiel, the   federal judge who is presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University, would show bias against him on account of his being “Mexican. ” But denouncing and renouncing are two different things. Come November, both Portman and Toomey may need Trump  —   or rather, Trump’s voters. As Steven Law, the chief executive of the conservative “super PAC” American Crossroads, told me: “According to research we’ve seen, there were demonstrably voters in 2012 who stayed home in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Specifically, there were white   voters who were discouraged by the perception that Romney was a wealthy plutocrat. ” As evidenced by exit polls taken early in the primary season across the Rust Belt, Trump’s message of aggrievement has especially resonated with the voters that Law says Toomey and Portman cannot afford to alienate. Even comparably comfortable   incumbents like Richard Burr of North Carolina and Roy Blunt of Missouri are ahead by narrow enough margins that one more particularly incendiary Trump statement could plausibly spell defeat in November. John McCain, whose valor as a prisoner of war Trump has mocked (“I like people who weren’t captured,” Trump told an audience in Iowa last July) this year finds himself once again struggling to avoid a primary upset at the hands of a more conservative challenger he offered his    support of the nominee in May, saying of Trump’s supporters, “I think it would be foolish to ignore them. ” To donors at a private event (which was recorded and leaked to Politico) however, McCain acknowledged, “If Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona, with over 30 percent of the vote being the Hispanic vote, no doubt that this may be the race of my life. ” Putting a brave face on it, some Republicans like Law insist that at the very least, Trump’s constituency is devoted enough to be counted on to show up to the polls in November. By contrast, they say, Clinton’s failure to earn the support of millennials (who went for her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, by a staggering   margin) could result in a decline in   turnout that might swing some   races their way. In other words, the depth of Clinton’s support is as questionable as the breadth of Trump’s, or so goes the argument. As Law  —   whose American Crossroads has spawned an offshoot organization, One Nation, that has made large ad buys in the states with vulnerable Republican Senate seats  —   told me: “In our research, we’ve found that upward of 30 to 40 percent of voters currently have a preference but aren’t satisfied with that preference. So I think there’s risk on both sides. ” I asked Law if he thought the risks really were that comparable. After all, while Clinton’s current disapproval rate is a bleak 55 percent, Trump’s is 15 points worse. In a    Senate race, won’t the greater dislike of Trump make a difference? “At this stage of the game, I’m not sure you can say that,” Law replied. Of course, at this stage of the game, American Crossroads is investing huge amounts in such races, running ads that have plenty to say about Hillary Clinton and nothing about Donald Trump. ’u2009A handful of Republican senators, as a matter of principle or political prophylaxis or both, have completely disassociated themselves from their party’s nominee. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has variously termed Trump a “  xenophobic religious bigot” and a “jackass. ” Jeff Flake of Arizona has urged his colleagues to withhold their endorsement of Trump “there are certain things you can’t do as a candidate,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation. ” Ben Sasse of Nebraska has described Trump’s attacks on Curiel as “the literal definition of racism” and has called for a   alternative. But Graham, Flake and Sasse aren’t up for   this year. Among the avowed Trump refuseniks, only Mark Kirk is. Kirk came by his opposition status belatedly. The former Naval intelligence officer is an unassuming centrist with an unfortunate knack for narrowly missing out on national attention. In April 2013, he became the second Republican senator to support   marriage, after Rob Portman (whose son is gay). Three months before that, Kirk was the first of his party’s senators to support   legislation with Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, after the Newtown massacre  —   but because Kirk’s standing with the National Rifle Association was already abysmal, Manchin sought out a more   Republican ally in Pat Toomey as a   for his bill. Still, Kirk is not without political acumen. He inveighed against Obamacare just enough to win in 2010, when Republicans largely succeeded in making House and Senate races into referendums on Obama’s legislative agenda. Six years later, Kirk took note of Trump’s ascent and fell in behind the presumptive nominee in March, though two different Kirk advisers described his support to me as “tepid” from the beginning. But, Kirk told me, he had trouble envisioning Trump as the kind of steady hand who could manage global crises the way President George Bush did during Kirk’s Navy days. “If it had been President Trump, I would have had problems,” he said. “Is he going to get angry? Is he going to start bombing?” Kirk saw his opening when Trump aired his views of Curiel. “After much consideration,“ Kirk said in a statement on June 7, “I have concluded that Donald Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world. ” Since then, the senator has spent as much time denouncing Trump as he has Clinton. “I joke to Ben Sasse that if Trump wins, he’ll be my roommate at Gitmo,” he told me. Unendorsing Trump was perhaps a more politically viable option for Kirk than for his fellow endangered Republican senators. “I’m probably the only one around here who absolutely embraces the ” he said, referring to “moderate. ” And as the Crain’s Chicago Business columnist Rich Miller recently wrote, in Illinois “independent suburban women have been the deciding factor in just about every statewide race since 1990. ” Given Trump’s 70 percent disapproval rating among women over all, criticizing the nominee may prove not only useful to Kirk, but also  —   especially against a female opponent like Duckworth  —   imperative. Kirk’s campaign strategists have chosen to view Trump, in a     sort of way, as a perverse gift for their candidate. Every   outburst by Trump offers an opportunity for Kirk to hurl himself into the spotlight as a Trump denouncer. But as Duckworth’s deputy campaign manager, Matt McGrath, told me, “If the Kirk campaign is of the mind that having daily or weekly opportunities to condemn Donald Trump is going to win this election for him  —   well, good luck with that. ” The alternative is to somehow ignore the   presidential candidate in modern political history  —   an approach that every vulnerable Republican senator aside from Kirk has adopted. The preferred strategy is to keep their politics local, “talking to voters like they’re running for sheriff,” as Ward Baker, the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s executive director, put it to me. The exemplar of this “Mayberry R. F. D. ” strategy is Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire’s   junior senator. Ayotte, like Kirk, won office in 2010 in what had recently been a swing state she now faces one of the Democratic Party’s top Senate recruits, the state’s sitting governor, Maggie Hassan. Ayotte has been a relentless presence in her state’s diners, farmer’s markets and   pageants this year. “In a close race like this one, I think that actual interaction with voters matters,” she told me in late June. We were sitting in Ayotte’s Senate office, where I had gone in hopes of finding out what it means to “support” but not “endorse” Trump. Although she entered politics as an apolitical state attorney general who had served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, Ayotte’s Senate victory in 2010 probably would not have occurred without the endorsement of Sarah Palin, who dubbed her the Granite Grizzly. Once in office, however, Ayotte quickly allied herself with establishment Republicans like McCain and Graham. Mitt Romney named her as a potential   candidate in the 2012 race, and as a   female legislator in a swing state she would very likely have fared similarly this year were the Republican nominee Rubio, Jeb Bush or someone other than Trump. When I asked the    former prosecutor to explain her position on the nominee, she offered a     sort of smile, then proceeded into a thicket of noncommittal verbiage. “Yeah, I think, um, that, I will  —   basically, the way I look at ‘support versus endorse’ is: I will be voting for him,” she began. “I obviously, when I endorse someone, I’m out campaigning, I’m endorsing and asking other people  —   people should vote their conscience in this election. That said, it doesn’t matter  —   it matters, but my point is, whoever wins, I’ll be working with them on things that’ll be good for New Hampshire and the country, and I’ll be in opposition to them on things that I think aren’t good for New Hampshire and the country. ” I asked if this meant she would not be campaigning with Trump when he showed up this fall to compete in her state. “You know,” she replied, “I’m going to be focused on getting my message out to New Hampshire voters. And that means being out there with New Hampshire voters. ” She added, “I don’t anticipate, really, campaigning with other folks. ” Ayotte’s quest to establish the appropriate distance from Trump is not purely a matter of political expedience. Since her arrival in Washington, the senator  —   who is married to an Iraq war veteran  —   has styled herself as a   specialist. In this arena, she said to me of Trump, “I have many disagreements with him,” before hastening to add, “I have more with the Democratic nominee. ” The     of Trump’s global vision  —   calls to “bomb the [expletive] out of ISIS” and to reintroduce waterboarding on the one hand, a general aversion to foreign intervention and historical alliances on the other  —   seems anathema to a    hawk like Ayotte. On these matters, her insistence to the contrary aside, the New Hampshire senator seems far more in sync with the former secretary of state than she does with the New York developer. Still, she has been willing to venture into Trump’s   zone on occasion, mocking Obama for “being politically correct about how we define our enemies” and describing his military strategy against ISIS as an electoral stunt. Ultimately, the Ayotte campaign’s objective is to avoid a   referendum altogether by advertising her practical skills as a bipartisan senator. Along these lines, Ayotte has made a point of emphasizing her support of the E. P. A. ’s Clean Power Plan, which seeks to address climate change by restricting   emissions. (When Ayotte first ran for Senate in 2010, she spoke of   climate change as an unproven theory. Since that time, she told me, “I’ve really looked at the issue and studied it further. ”) She also points to her vote for the Senate’s bipartisan   legislation in 2013  —   a position that ended her support from Palin, who called her a “ ”  —   and says that today, as she put it to me, “I want to be in the camp of solving the problem. ” Her campaign operatives also reminded me that Ayotte denounced Senator Ted Cruz last year for using the threat of a government shutdown as leverage for defunding Planned Parenthood  —   though this was really a tactical objection on her part, given that Ayotte has voted on six occasions to stop federal funding for the organization. Ayotte’s opponent, Hassan, intends to cite the incumbent’s votes against Planned Parenthood and her opposition to a hearing for Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, as among the reasons that she is out of step with New Hampshire voters. The looming presence of Trump amounts to a bonus for Hassan. As her campaign manager, Marc Goldberg, told me, “Trump will be just one part of this race  —   though maybe a significant part. ” Speaking of Ayotte, he said, “It will definitely make her life difficult on a    basis. ” On that point, Ayotte’s supporters reluctantly agree. “If we had Rubio or Jeb at the top of the ticket, I’m sure the Democrats would try to tie our candidate in New Hampshire to policies they deem unpopular,” says the former Romney strategist Ryan Williams. “The difference is that Trump goes beyond the pale with statements he makes on a daily basis. He seems not to care what effect it has on the other candidates. He seems not to understand the responsibility that comes with the mantle. ” Fifteen years after his landslide defeat, Barry Goldwater penned an autobiography that he titled “With No Apologies. ” The Arizona senator in fact harbored a few regrets  —   among them, that he had staked out an ideological opposition to the Civil Rights Act, and that his losing candidacy (which also brought down 36 House and two Senate seats) paved the way for the   four years later of Richard Nixon, whose Watergate scandal would bring dishonor to their party. But Goldwater held himself largely blameless for the outcome of the 1964 election. It was his own party’s fault, he asserted, for demonizing a conservative vision that would, 16 years later, be validated by Reagan. “By the time the convention opened,” he wrote of his fellow Republicans, “I had been branded as a fascist, a racist, a   warmonger, a nuclear madman and the candidate who couldn’t win. ” By the time the 2016 Republican convention opens in Cleveland this month, Trump will also have been branded  —   by fellow Republicans who now revere Goldwater as a movement godfather  —   as a racist madman who cannot win. Some of them may show up to Cleveland in hopes of staging a delegate upheaval and in that way thwarting Trump’s coronation. But many other party notables, like Ayotte and Kirk, have already found excuses not to attend the convention. Trump did not seem particularly concerned that he might be shunned or subverted at the convention when he spoke to me by phone one recent afternoon. “I have a lot of support from senators,” he insisted. “And then some of them are neutral. ” New Hampshire’s junior senator fell squarely in the latter category, he acknowledged: “Kelly Ayotte has been silent, more or less. Honestly, I don’t mind that she’s silent. ” Somewhat cryptically, he added, “We can both be silent, to be honest with you. ” As for Kirk, Trump said he had reason to believe that the Illinois senator’s distaste for him was feigned, but he would not share his evidence for the record. He reminded me that he had won both Kirk’s and Ayotte’s states during the primaries and predicted that he would repeat that feat in November. If the two senators felt it wise to separate themselves from their party’s leader, then Trump would support, if not endorse, the idea. “I want them to do what they need to do,” he said of the vulnerable senators. “It’s fine with me. It won’t hurt me. I think it’ll hurt them, frankly. ”</td>\n",

       "        <td>WARNING: This story contains graphic language. Donald Trump apologized early Saturday for lewd and sexually aggressive remarks he made a decade ago    and then made it clear he is girding himself for a nasty political battle. The GOP presidential nominee posted a defiant   video just after midnight on social media, telling voters that he is not a ”perfect person” and that the words captured by a hot mic in 2005 ”don’t reflect who I am.” ”I said it, I was wrong and I apologize,” Trump said of footage from a previously unaired taping of ”Access Hollywood” that surfaced Friday, in which Trump said he tried to ”fuck” a married woman and bragged about being able to grope women because of his ”star” status. But Trump quickly pivoted back onto the attack, raising Bill Clinton’s sex scandals and Hillary Clinton’s role in discrediting women who had affairs with her husband. ”I’ve said some foolish things, but there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.” And in closing, Trump added ominously: ”We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.” While Trump refuted the lewd terms in which he discussed women in the 2005 tape, the Republican nominee did not apologize for or address the behavior he said in that conversation that he engaged in toward women, including that he could ”grab them by the pussy” and that he would sometimes ”just start kissing them.” He later tweeted Saturday morning: ”Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!” Trump’s foreshadowing that he will raise Bill Clinton’s affairs and sex abuse allegations from the 1990s ”in the coming days” suggest that the Republican nominee is switching gears after suggesting as recently as Thursday night that he would not raise those scandals in the debate on Sunday. ”I think we’re all better off if we can do that,” Trump said at a town hall event in New Hampshire on Thursday night. But the bombshell 2005 recording has now put Trump on his heels    with Republicans warning of his demise    and the brash billionaire appears prepared to do what he does best: punch back. Shocking remarks, Trump is heard discussing women in vulgar terms during   banter during the taping of a segment for ”Access Hollywood,” footage which was obtained by The Washington Post. During the lewd conversation captured by a microphone Trump was wearing on his lapel, Trump recounts how he tried to ”fuck” an unidentified married woman before bragging that he is ”automatically attracted to beautiful (women)” and just starts ”kissing them.” ”Access Hollywood” later identified the unidentified woman as Nancy O’Dell, who used to work for the show. CNN has attempted to contact O’Dell’s manager but has not heard back.  In the video, Trump uses the name ”Nancy.”   The conversation came months after Trump married his third and current wife, Melania. The ’ ’ problem: Trump’s comments pose issue for news outlets, He also said: ”When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything . .. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” The   description of uninhibited sexual assault as a benefit of his celebrity poses a substantial setback to Trump’s attempts to overcome his deficit with female voters with just a month until Election Day. Clinton and her campaign have repeatedly sought to portray Trump as disrespectful and demeaning toward women, bringing up a slew of rude and vulgar comments Trump has made about women during and before his run for president. House Speaker Paul Ryan, saying he was ”sickened” by Trump’s comments, announced Friday night that the GOP presidential nominee would no longer attend a Republican event in Wisconsin at which the two were slated to appear on Saturday. Multiple sources told CNN that Trump was asked not to come by Ryan, and one source said the message was delivered via intermediaries. Can Trump recover from this? Trump’s campaign said vice presidential nominee Mike Pence would represent him instead while the real estate magnate focuses on debate prep. Trump campaign advisers were huddling together in Trump Tower Friday night trying to figure out how to react. Among the options being considered was whether Trump should make a public appearance Friday night. Stakes raised for debate, The comments immediately raised the stakes for Sunday’s highly anticipated debate between Trump and Clinton, and the remarks could hand her    and viewers in the town hall audience    more evidence to make that point. Trump’s lewd comments about women from 2005, And the remarks prompted Trump    for the first time in his nearly   campaign    to apologize. ”This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course   not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended,” Trump said in a statement released Friday. Clinton’s campaign tweeted a link to the story and said simply, ”This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.” Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, campaigning in Las Vegas, said Trump’s comments ”makes me sick to my stomach.” ”I don’t like to say the words that he’s used in the past when he calls women, ’pigs, dogs and slobs’ . .. but this is behavior that’s just outrageous and so that there would be a news story that would have more statements like this of this kind, I mean, gosh, I’m sad to say that I’m not surprised,” Kaine said. ”I should be surprised and shocked. I’m sad to say that I’m not.” A Clinton campaign source told CNN the campaign strategy in the wake of the tape will be to press Republicans to say if they still think Trump should be president. Member of ’Central Park 5’ blasts Trump, ”Not just condemn what he said    but that he should be POTUS,” the source said. Two people close to the campaign told CNN the former secretary of state was unlikely to speak about the controversy Friday night. But it has become a new subject of her debate prep, and the campaign will pressure Ryan and other Republicans to disavow Trump throughout the weekend. ’You can do anything’ The hot mic conversation captured in 2005 begins with Trump recounting to ”Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush how he tried to have sex with a married woman. ”I moved on her and I failed. I’ll admit it,” Trump says in the   audio. ”I did try and fuck her. She was married.” ”I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there. And she was married,” Trump adds, after saying he took the woman    who is identified only by her first name    out furniture shopping. WikiLeaks posts emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, ”Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look,” Trump says of the woman. The conversation took place as Trump arrived in a tour bus on the set of ”Days of Our Lives,” the soap opera where he was set to make a cameo appearance. Before Trump stepped off the bus, he and Bush appear to see an actress from the soap opera who greets Trump and Bush. ”Whoa!” Trump says. ”I’ve gotta use some tic tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful    I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.” ”And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything . .. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything,” Trump says. ”Whatever you want,” says another voice. Priebus condemns remarks, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus condemned Trump’s remark in a briefly,   statement. ”No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever,” Priebus wrote. Journalists covering a Toledo, Ohio, campaign stop by Pence were ushered out of a restaurant soon after the story broke. The press was supposed to cover Pence looking at a wall of signed hot dogs, including one by Trump, but were later told they couldn’t record the moment. Trump’s women problem, A campaign staffer later told CNN the decision had ”nothing to do with the news.” Pence declined to answer a question about the matter when asked by a reporter following a campaign event in Rossford, Ohio. Some of Trump’s old political foes rushed to slam the GOP nominee. ”As the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women,” Jeb Bush tweeted. ”Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world,” Mitt Romney said on Twitter. In Colorado, suburban women are key vote, ”Make no mistake the comments were wrong and offensive. They are indefensible,” John Kasich added. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a Republican who recently said he would vote for Trump, called for Trump to drop out of the race. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who over the summer had said he would vote for Trump, withdrew his support Friday night. So did House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican. Even Terry Gainer, a former US Senate sergeant at arms who rarely makes political comments, emailed CNN to say, ”It is not just woman who should shun Trump. Any gentleman, every husband, each father of a daughter, bother of a sister and sons must be outraged. ”How do I explain this to my granddaughters? If only a Republican leader would stand and exhibit a profile in courage.” Staffers shocked, Reactions from GOP staffers and advisers to Trump ranged from astonished to apoplectic. A close adviser to Trump told CNN the story is ”flat out appalling” and at this point, they can’t even begin to guess whether Trump can come back from this. ”This should have never happened. I wish it had never happened. I think I know that men talk this way sometimes, but it’s nothing I would ever want to hear or condone or approve of,” the adviser said. ”My reaction is    it’s appalling. It’s just flat out appalling.” The adviser also said Trump’s apology does not go far enough. Where Donald Trump gets the 9. 7% unemployment rate, ”Doing anything other than to say it was a grievous error and he apologizes would be a mistake,” the adviser said. ”I would take it a step further and own to the words as being offensive    not ’if. ’” The adviser, clearly exasperated, added: ”Another day in Trump world . .. I hate it.” Asked about the reaction at a campaign field office, a Trump field staffer told CNN there were ”gasps. Collective gasps. We’re trying to get our heads around it right now, but there’s no way to spin this. There just isn’t.” The staffer, who is also paying close attention to Senate efforts, also added, unsolicited: ”Just think of the   effect. Brutal.” A GOP operative in Ohio voiced similar sentiments. ”This is bad. I think this thing is over,” the staffer said. Reached for comment, a top battleground state staffer told CNN he was ”picking (his) chin off the floor.” Democrats seek to punish GOP Senate candidates over Trump audio, ”We want every suburban woman’s vote in America. This doesn’t help with that,” the staffer said. And a Trump campaign source said they were ”dumbfounded,” saying the remarks ”could be a death knell.” The source had no predictions on how the article will impact the race, saying the next two days will be critical. ”I think the next 48 hours will be the most consequential of the entire election. Right here, right now, this is game time,” the source said. One senior Trump adviser said simply, ”Ugh.” A stunning apology, The seriousness of Trump’s remarks could be gauged by his apology, the first time he has offered such a concession as a presidential candidate. He has offered ”regret” on several occasions, notably in August when he acknowledged he sometimes says ”the wrong thing” and in April when he said retweeting an unflattering picture of Ted Cruz’s wife, Heidi Cruz, was ”a mistake.” Previously, Trump has said that he would only apologize for something if he was ”wrong.” ”I fully think apologizing is a great thing. But you have to be wrong,” Trump said in a September 2015 appearance on ”The Tonight Show.” And in a March CNN town hall, Trump could not recount the last time he had apologized for something but said that ”if you’re not wrong, I don’t believe in apologizing.” Pressed again on specific times when he’s apologized for anything in his life. ”Yes, I mean    apologized    I apologized to my mother years ago for using foul language,” Trump said. ”I apologize to my wife for not being presidential on occasion.”  Trump and women, Trump has repeatedly bragged that ”nobody respects women more” than him and has vowed to ”cherish” and ”protect” women as president. But the newly unearthed recording is just the latest revelation that shows the crude and   sexist terms Trump has used to describe women. During his run for president, Trump suggested that his GOP primary opponent Carly Fiorina, a former Fortune 500 CEO, was too ugly to be elected president, shouting ”look at that face! Would anyone vote for that?” during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. And Trump also suggested that Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly asked him tough questions during the first GOP debate because she was on her period, saying there was ”blood coming out of her wherever.” Trump most recently stoked controversy after he defended his belief that former Miss Universe Alicia Machado had ”gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem.” He was also accused of calling her ”Miss Piggy” back in the 1990s. In his numerous appearances on ”The Howard Stern Show,” Trump also frequently engaged the show’s host in lewd and objectifying conversations about women, including discussing his sexual encounters. Head of Trump’s religious advisory board dismisses vulgar remarks, Trump on the show frequently ranked women on a scale of 1 to 10 and discussed everything from oral sex to anal sex to whether he could get an erection for certain famous women. ”A person who is   is very hard to be a 10,” Trump said in one segment with Stern. Discussing a famous actress’s recent breast augmentation, Trump said: ”The boob job is terrible, you know they look like two light posts coming out of a body.” Trump most recently defended some of the crude comments he has made about women by telling local Las Vegas news station KSNV that ”a lot of that was done for the purposes of entertainment.” ”There’s nobody that has more respect for women than I do,” Trump said.</td>\n",

       "        <td>’  ’ ’”   ’ ’  ’ ’     To understand Trump, you have to set aside the  he gave before     his election and the  he has released since. You     also have to set aside the caricature of him as a         woman hater who will deport every immigrant     he can find. Instead, look at the four interviews he has given     since his election: to the Wall Street Journal, 60     Minutes, the New York Times, and a group of TV     anchors and executives. In these exchanges, all of them     conducted outside the   context of the campaign,     you’ll see how squishy he is. Trump  a  and he’s a  to the country and the world. But     it’s not because he’s a strongman. It’s because he’s a     weakling.   ’ ’     That’s the short version. The longer story is more complicated.     Here are the various facets of Trump’s personality, how they     fit together, and why they make him dangerous.   ’ ’1. He’s all about reciprocal love. In the     campaign, Trump often played on fear and hate. He targeted     Muslims, refugees, undocumented immigrants, and any other     scapegoat that served his interests. But deep down, what he     wanted was the love of his adoring crowds. Emotionally, he’s a     child. He can love others, but only if they love him first. And     that’s how he sees his presidency. In his  on Nov. 22, he explained that his job is     “taking care of the people that really have proven to be —  to     love Donald Trump. ”   ’ ’2. His reflexes are vindictive. When Trump was     down in the polls, he railed against Hillary Clinton, the     press, and fellow Republicans. On election night, he said those     grudges were . But they weren’t. In       tweets, he   and the cast of . He      for     supporting ongoing recounts, even after they  and     said they just wanted to make sure the recounts . He summoned TV     executives to Trump Tower on Nov. 21,  the “,” and      them for . The     next day, in his meeting with the Times, he bragged     that he had stiffed job requests and pleas for campaign help     from two Republican Senate candidates who had failed to support     him. That’s how Trump behaves on his political honeymoon.     Imagine what he’ll do when the going gets rough.   ’ ’  ’ ’3. His ego is fragile. After winning the     Republican nomination in May, Trump gloated about it for     months. Now he’s gloating about the election. In tweets and     interviews, he has  that he beat Clinton     “. ” On Tuesday, he ran     another victory lap,  the addition of     Michigan to his “. ” To understand     how central this is to Trump’s sense of himself, check out the     first 19 paragraphs of his interview with the Times.     Invited by the publisher to give opening remarks, Trump spoke     at length, not about the future but about his genius and     prowess on the campaign trail. In his Nov. 11 interview with      he     bragged about the number of Twitter followers he had gained.   ’ ’     A   who is   doesn’t behave this way.     Nor does he snap at a   sketch comedy show. Nor does     he summon TV executives to complain that  they     have aired are . Trump     does these things because he’s deeply insecure and easily     wounded.   ’ ’4. He craves approval. Trump often comes       across as indifferent to the feelings of others. That’s       misleading. He cares intensely about being respected and       loved. Consider his twisted relationship with the       Times. For two weeks after the election, he tweeted       that the paper was “,” “,” and “. ” Despite this, he requested a meeting and       showed up at the paper’s offices to wag his tail. He promised       Times staffers an immigration bill that “even the       people in this room can be happy” with. He told them “it       would be, to me, a great achievement if I could come back       here in a year or two years   …     and have a lot of the folks       here say, ‘You’ve done a great job.’ And I don’t mean just a       conservative job, ’cause I’m not talking conservative. I mean       just, we’ve done a good job. ” Yes, Mr. President. Good boy.     ’ ’5. He’s easily soothed by flattery. Trump is       a champ at nursing grudges when he feels cheated, threatened,       or disrespected. But his grudges, like his commitments, can       be washed out by small doses of affection. He speaks       glowingly of generous   phone calls he received       from the and the . He has  in       return. Those threats to prosecute Hillary? . Trump also       can’t stop clucking about his Nov. 10 meeting with President       Obama. At least  Trump has        to have “” with the       man he had never previously met and had repeatedly denounced       as the .       That’s how easily Trump’s wrath can turn to warmth —  and vice       versa.     ’ ’  ’ ’6. He’s a softie. If Trump hurts a lot of       people as president, it won’t be out of malice. Calling       Clinton a “” from the       safety of a podium, or threatening a few flag burners with        is easy. But Trump doesn’t have the stomach to       face down millions of angry Americans. On 60       Minutes, he backed away from talk of deportation,       criminalizing abortions, and reopening the legal debate over         marriage. If Roe v. Wade were overturned,       said Trump, the worst thing women might have to endure is       that “they’ll have to go to another state. ” As for LGBT       people, he pleaded, “I mentioned them at the Republican       National Convention! And everybody said, ‘That was so great.’       ” Trump might not understand the effects of his policies or       appointments, but he knows what he needs: praise. He’s not an       attack dog. He wants to be petted.     ’ ’7. His emotional softness makes him morally       weak. Trump’s critics see him as a thug who will       damage the country and the world through aggression. That       could happen. But he’s far more likely to usher in bad things       by being a lapdog when we need a watchdog. To take a small       example: Three men who had partnered with Trump in a real       estate project in India met with him after his election, took       pictures with him, and . When the Times asked Trump about       this, he pleaded: “What am I going to say? ‘I’m not going to       talk to you’? ‘I’m not going to take pictures’?   …     On a human       basis, you take pictures. ”     ’ ’         Trump was just being nice. But that kind of niceness can         cause trouble. During the campaign, Trump said he would         keep jobs in the U. S. by threatening companies that plan to         move their operations elsewhere. But as           he’s not using threats. He’s using bribes. He described to         the Times one of “numerous” conversations he’s had         with CEOs since the election. “We’ll create the incentives         for you,” Trump told the executive. “We’re going for a very         large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy         about. ” So the jobs will stay. But they’ll be funded by         taxpayers, and employers will control the transactions.       ’ ’         Trump is a patsy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, too.         He effused to the Journal about a “” letter Putin         sent him after the election. “I would love to be able to         get along with Russia,” Trump told the Times. He         claimed, based on reactions at his rallies, that getting         along with Russia would also make Americans happy: “I’d say         this in front of thousands of people.   …     ‘Wouldn’t it be         nice if we actually got along with Russia? Wouldn’t it be         nice if we went after ISIS together?’   …     And the people         [would] stand up and give me a massive hand. ”       ’ ’  ’ ’         Trump treats the presidency the way he treated The         Apprentice: . There’s no limit         to the moral lines he would cross to give the audience what         it wants. In the Times interview, he said he might         withdraw his support for waterboarding if it were found to         be ineffective at extracting useful information. But he         added: “If it’s so important to the American people, I         would go for it. I would be guided by that. ”       ’ ’8. He substitutes popularity for standards of         conduct. Trump sees the moral universe in terms of         feelings, not rules or reasons. He told the Times         he could combine his presidency and his business any way he         chose. Anything he did to limit conflicts of interest, he         asserted, would be out of the generosity of his heart. He         also suggested that he didn’t have to sweat conflicts of         interest because voters, by electing him, had shown they         didn’t care about them. “Prior to the election it was well         known that I have interests in properties all over the         world,” he . “Only the         crooked media makes this a big deal!”       ’ ’         Trump is just as dismissive about financial transparency.         “Are you gonna release your tax returns?” Lesley Stahl         asked him on 60 Minutes. “Nobody cares,” Trump         replied. “Obviously, the public didn’t care, because I won         the election very easily. ” He gave a similar brushoff to         concerns about his   political style. The         Journal reported that it had asked Trump “whether         he thought his rhetoric had gone too far in the campaign. ”         His answer, according to the paper: “No. I won. ” Winning         means people don’t mind what you did. And if they don’t         mind, then what you did wasn’t wrong.       ’ ’9. He confuses controversy with mystery.         Because Trump deals in emotions rather than facts, he’s         easily swayed by intensity. Even in matters of science,         he’s more affected by the number of people who believe         something than by the evidence for their beliefs. “There         are few things where there’s more division than climate         change,” Trump told the Times. “There are people         on the other side of that issue. ” He went on: “My uncle was         for 35 years a professor at M. I. T.   …     He had feelings on         this subject. It’s a very complex subject. I’m not sure         anybody is ever going to really know. ”       ’ ’         What expertise did Trump’s uncle have in climate         forecasting? Not much, since the uncle specialized in         . What evidence did he have? Again, not much,         since he . But         he did have “feelings,” as Trump points out. So do all         those “people on the other side. ” The only scientific         instrument Trump needs is a finger in the wind.       ’ ’  ’ ’10. He’s obtuse to the pain he inflicts.         If Trump cares so much about feelings, why doesn’t he see         all the fear and stress he has caused? Because that would         require him to accept criticism, and his ego can’t handle         it. On 60 Minutes, he batted away questions about         his invective during the campaign, insisting that “my         strongest asset is my temperament” and that he “can’t         regret” anything he’d said. If some folks are upset by his         election, that can’t be his fault, so it has to be theirs.         “There are people, Americans, who are scared, and some of         them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against         you, against your rhetoric,” Stahl told him. Trump seemed         baffled. “That’s only because they don’t know me,” he said.       ’ ’         Trump is virtually lobotomized. Unable to acknowledge his         role in  he blames         others. When Stahl told him that “African Americans think         there’s a target on their back,” and “Muslims are         terrified,” he shrugged that such fears were “built up by         the press, because, frankly, they’ll take every single         little incident   …     and they’ll make [it] into an event. ” In         his interview with the Times, Trump claimed that         low black turnout showed how popular he was: “A lot of         people didn’t show up, because the           community liked me. ” The vanity of this man is bottomless.       ’ ’11. He feels the pain of his allies, not the pain         of people different from him. Trump sees no need to         reassure the ethnic or religious communities he in the campaign.         On Nov. 10, when he visited the U. S. Capitol, a reporter         called out, “Are you going to ask Congress to ban Muslims         from entering the country?” Trump heard the question,         replied, “Thank you, everybody,” and . The next         day, in his interview with 60 Minutes, he         belittled reports of racial slurs from his supporters,         calling them “a very small amount. ” When a Times         staffer asked him about a conference of Trump sympathizers         who had “pledged their allegiance to Nazism,” Trump         expressed surprise that reporters were still pestering him         about such things. “Boy, you are really into this stuff,”         he said. He uttered four words of intransitive         boilerplate —  “I disavow and condemn” —  and moved on.       ’ ’           But when people who feel threatened by Trump challenge           his friends, he rushes to defend his friends. On Nov. 18,           Vice President —  elect Mike Pence went to see           Hamilton. After the show, the cast delivered a           short  to Pence on           behalf of “the diverse America who are alarmed and           anxious that your new administration will not protect           us. ” The message concluded: “We truly hope that this show           has inspired you to uphold our American values and to           work on behalf of all of us. ” Trump responded by           attacking the cast on Twitter, charging that they had           “” Pence and           violated the theater as “. ”         ’ ’           Trump also rose to the defense of his   man,           Steve Bannon, after a Times reporter asked about           Trump’s appointment of Bannon, “who has been described by           some as racist and ” to a White House job.           Trump called Bannon “a decent guy” who had “been treated           very unfairly. ” The exchange was bizarre in part because           Bannon himself, in an interview at the Republican           National Convention in August, had proudly declared,           “. ” Yet Trump assured the Times:           “I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was           a racist, or   or any of [those] things   …     I           wouldn’t even think about hiring him. ” Trump doesn’t fuss           about Bannon’s record. He just thinks: He’s my           friend, so he’s good, and whatever he said is OK.         ’ ’  ’ ’12. He’s easily manipulated. Having a           fragile,   narcissist as president isn’t           the end of the world. It just means that to get him to do           the right thing, you have to pet him. In Trump’s             exchanges, we have several useful models.           The first is Obama, who gave Trump a tongue bath in their             meeting on Nov. 10 and may have saved his           signature legislative achievement in the process. Three           days after that meeting, Trump told the Journal           he was reconsidering his pledge to abolish Obama’s health           insurance program: “Either Obamacare will be amended, or           repealed and replaced. ”         ’ ’           The second model is Times columnist Tom           Friedman. In the group session at Times           headquarters on Nov. 22, Friedman worked Trump like a           horndog in a bar, trying to get him into bed on climate           change. “You own some of the most beautiful links golf           courses in the world,” Friedman told Trump. “I’d hate to           see Royal Aberdeen underwater,” the columnist added. When           Trump ragged on windmills, Friedman whispered sweet           nothings: “General Electric has a big wind turbine           factory in South Carolina. ” Trump, eager for approval,           told the Timesstaffers about his “many           environmental awards” and bragged, “I’m actually an           environmentalist. ” By the end of the session, Friedman           had Trump eating out of his hand.         ’ ’           The third model is a story Trump told about his threat to           narrow the First Amendment. During the primaries, Trump           had  to “open up           our libel laws so when [journalists] write purposely           negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them           and win lots of money. ” But in his meeting with the           Times, Trump said someone had later warned him,           “It’s a great idea, softening up those laws, but you may           get sued a lot more. ” “You’re right, I never thought           about that,” Trump recalled telling this person. And that           reflection led Trump to assure the Times that on           the question of libel laws, “You’re going to be fine. ”         ’ ’             The fourth model is Jim Mattis, the retired general who              to be considered for secretary of defense. Trump             asked Mattis about waterboarding, which Trump             supported. “I’ve never found it to be useful,” said             Mattis, according to Trump’s account of their             conversation. “Give me a pack of cigarettes and a             couple of beers, and I do better with that than I do             with torture,” the general told him. Trump told the             Times that he was “very impressed by that             answer,” especially because it came from “the toughest             guy. ” Waterboarding, Trump concluded, was “not going to             make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of             people think. ”           ’ ’             That’s how you move Trump. You don’t talk about ethics.             You play the toughness card. You appeal to the art of             the deal. You make him feel smart, powerful, and loved.             You don’t forget how unmoored and volatile he is, but             you set aside your fear and your anger. You thank God             that you’re dealing with a narcissist, not a               killer. And until you can get him safely             out of the White House, you work with what you have.             People in other countries have dealt with presidents             like Trump for a long time. Can we handle it? Yes, we             can.           ’</td>\n",

Trump because “I’m going to be fighting for you” and “not for them. ” 8:10: Trump accuses the Clintons of bribing Lynch and says Lynch must be thinking that she may get four more years if she exonerates Clinton. 8:08: Trump continues to mock Clinton’s meeting with Lynch and their claims re: speaking about golf and grandchildren for 30 minutes: Trump is now speculating how long it takes to talk about grandchildren. ”Maybe 30 seconds.”  —   Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) July 6, 2016,  8:00: Trump says Clinton “put the entire country in danger”  and we now know she “lied to the country” when she said she did not send classified information on her server. Trump says Clinton was “grossly incompetent” and would be a “lousy president. ” Trump posits that she puts the lives of Americans at risk to pursue her “corrupt financial dealings. ” Trump says Clinton had her lawyers delete and “wipe away forever” 30, 000 emails like a “criminal with a guilty conscience. ” Trump says all of this “disqualifies” her from being President. 7:59: Trump: Today is best evidence our system is completely rigged. [And just as he is gaining some momentum, he then becomes a scatterbrain and talks about process. Gives himself credit for bringing up that the system is “rigged. ” Again, nobody cares about this stuff. They care about how Clinton gets to play by one set of rules while others play by another.] 7:58: Trump says “stupidity” is not a reason someone should be innocent. Trump says he doesn’t Clinton’s email scandal was a result of “stupidity. ” 7:57: Trump says “we’re a country of law” and other people have been hurt doing “so much less” than Hillary Clinton. He says Clinton’s exoneration is a “tragedy. ” He asks if this means we have to take back the punishment given to those who have done so much less because we are a country that is supposed to be fair. 7:55: Trump praises wounded   for having a better attitude about life than he does. He blasts Obama for announcing when America was going to pull out of Iraq. He again repeats his standard line about Iraq being the “Harvard” for terrorists. 7:50: Trump says “I’m your messenger” and the message is “we’re going to take our country back” and everybody will be included. Trump says “we’ve got to bring our country together. ” 7:47: Trump says it’s so much easier to do “phoners” and it’s a sign that “you’re hot. ” Nobody, especially the voters he needs to win, cares about this type of stuff except him. All this does is reveal his insecurity and incessant craving for  . 7:45: Trump says “we need unity” in the Republican Party. The crowd in Raleigh is really fired up tonight  —   and laughing at all of Donald Trump’s jokes. You can see him feeding off the energy.  —   Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) July 5, 2016,  7:42: Trump mocks Obama for lecturing about climate   footprints while taking Air Force One to play golf in Hawaii while “our country is going to hell” and “ISIS is laughing at us. ” 7:40: Trump says Obama, like a carnival act, is having “a lot of fun. ” He says we need a President who is not “divisive” and is going to take care of the   community. He says Obama is “all talk, no action. ” He says we need a president who will  help Hispanics get jobs that they don’t have right now. 7:38: Clinton says Clinton’s “judgment is horrible. ” Trump says whether it’s ISIS or trade or borders or jobs, it’s going to be four  more years of the same. He says the “last thing we need is another Clinton” or an “  in the White House. ” Trump vows to bring jobs back to “our country” and it’s going to be “America, America, America first. ” 7:30: Trump mocks Bill Clinton, saying he “just  happened” to be on the same tarmac as Lynch. Trump starts talking about how many people thought Clinton was guilty. Then he changes his train of thought and again goes to his crutch and talks process minutiae that nobody cares about. He then blasts Clinton for wanting to admit Syrian refugees, which he says can be the “  Trojan horse. ” 7:25: Donald Trump blasts the “totally rigged” system but says we’re still happy to be together. “What a system,” he says. Trump introduces establishment GOP Sen. Bob Corker ( ) to make some rather bland remarks. Corker is reportedly being vetted to be Trump’s running mate. Corker says the reason that people love Donald Trump so much (hint: partly because he isn’t an establishment politician like Corker) is because Trump loves the people and wants the “best for you. ” 7:08: Miller says the question is why Clinton would risk so much to “stash and hide” all of her emails on the secret server. Miller says the answer is because if the public could ever see what she did in the light of day, her career would be “instantly over. ” He says it was a cover up from the scrutiny that would come if her actions ever saw the light of day. Miller asks voters if they are prepared to restore honest and decency back to government. 7:06: At Trump’s North Carolina rally, Senior Policy Adviser asks what would happen in your life if you did   of the things Clinton did. He points out there are one sets of rules for regular Americans and another for the rulers. He says the America people will be the “ultimate deciders” re: whether Clinton can get away with it. 6:35: Clinton’s largest event to date drew 7, 000. And she needed Obama to even get to that number. Trump and Sanders have routinely drawn tens of thousands at their rallies: Tuesday’s event with Obama was the largest of HRC’s campaign, per aides, who said the fire marshall counted 7, 000 in the room.  —   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) July 5, 2016,  6:00: Dedicated Trump supporters in North Carolina: Watch the rally here: The   speeches before @realDonaldTrump takes the stage.  #WRAL #TrumpRally pic. twitter.   —   Lynda Loveland (@WRALLynda) July 5, 2016,  People in Raleigh, NC in line for Trump rally stick it out even when a hard rain starts. pic. twitter.   —   Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) July 5, 2016,    Waiting in line for Trump despite a heat index of 109!

Obama says he wants to be “blunt” but if he really wanted to be blunt, he’d say he is voting for Clinton because he hates Trump. 4:20: Axelrod on Clinton’s “bobblehead” nod: Šomeone gas GOT to give @HillaryClinton an alternative maneuver to the bobblehead nod.

Obama claims there has never been anyone —  man or woman —  more qualified than Hillary Clinton to be President. [Tony Lee: Hillary is like the eager high school student who pads her resume to make her the “most qualified” for Ivy League schools and excels on tests where people have to just regurgitate facts but lacks a core and will always do horribly when any test throws her a curve   critical thinking.] 3:55: Obama, invoking the late Ann Richards, says Clinton was like Ginger Rogers because she had to everything he did but also “backwards and in high heels. ” He says he has had a   seat to Clinton’s “judgment” [what does that say?] and toughness. Obama says Clinton was a “great” Secretary of State.

He says he loves the people —  even those who aren’t voting for him are nice, he says. He says the state has some great food. He praises the state’s basketball culture. 3:48: Tony Lee: Hillary introducing Obama (not the other way around) tells you all you need to know about which candidate viscerally appeals more to the minority voters Clinton desperately needs to win the White House. Within 30 seconds of his speech, Obama, on the stump, shows how robotic and stiff Clinton is. 3:46: Newt to campaign with Trump in Ohio on Wed.: . @newtgingrich will campaign   @realDonaldTrump in Ohio tomorrow, per a Trump spox, our @SaraMurray reports.

He confirmed that her email could easily have been hacked by hostile actors, and confirmed that those she emailed with were hacked. Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on Hillary Clinton, and this fact alone disqualifies her from service. It has also been revealed that Hillary Clinton lied when she said that she did not send classified information. The FBI Director confirmed that over 100 emails were deemed classified at the time they were sent, including emails classified as top secret. On top of it all, Hillary Clinton’s lawyers wiped the servers clean to delete another 30, 000 emails  —   hiding her corrupt dealings from investigators. She used the State Department for her personal gain, trading favors for cash, and tried to conceal the records. Also, she didn’t want people to know the details about her botched decisions in Libya, Syria, Iraq and Egypt that destabilized the Middle East. But because of our rigged system that holds the American people to one standard and people like Hillary Clinton to another, it does not look like she will be facing the criminal charges that she deserves. Bill Clinton didn’t accidentally run into the Attorney General on the airport tarmac last week in Phoenix. Hillary Clinton didn’t accidentally sneak into the FBI during one of the country’s biggest holiday weekends to testify on her illegal activities, something that wouldn’t be afforded to others under investigation (and on a Saturday of all days). It was no accident that charges were not recommended against Hillary the exact same day as President Obama campaigns with her for the first time. 3:35: Clinton praises Obama’s accomplishments and lists her laundry list of policy proposals re: jobs and education [Clinton does not know how to campaign in poetry]. 3:32: Clinton says she has known Obama as a friend, but she has to read from a Teleprompter. Clinton says Obama has never forgotten where he came from and taunts Trump, saying, “Donald, if you’re out there Tweeting, it’s Hawaii. ” Clinton praises Obama’s “brilliant” wife Michelle and Obama’s “two amazing daughters. ” HRC says Obama is ”someone who has never forgotten where he came from —  and Donald if you’re out there tweeting, it’s Hawaii.”  —   Liz Goodwin (@lizcgoodwin) July 5, 2016,  3:30: Obama and Clinton take the stage in North Carolina.

And “freedom matters. ” He says for much of human history, government power has been a constant in life. “But not here. We have no king or queen. We have no dictator. We the people constrain government,” he says. “Our nation is exceptional because it was built on five of the most powerful words in the English language —  I want to be free. ” He says never has that message been more needed than today.

       "        <td>Allies of Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) are now targeting conservative legend Phyllis Schlafly, a leading grassroots   voice for half a century, because Schlafly endorsed billionaire businessman Donald Trump for president in the 2016 GOP primary. [Several Cruz supporters inside Eagle Forum are unhappy with Phyllis Schlafly’s Trump endorsement, and have been working behind the scenes against her for months. They have leaked emails, engaged in personal attacks, and even advanced an argument questioning whether the    Schlafly is still competent enough to run the organization. Now, several board members of one wing of the tripartite Eagle Forum organization have for the first time in more than four decades of existence called together a special board meeting at which they purported to have voted to remove Schlafly’s handpicked successor as president of the organization and claim to have seized control of the organization and its bank accounts from the longtime activist.  They might not be done yet, as they have another special meeting scheduled for early May at which they intend to —  sources say —  remove Schlafly herself as chairman of the board. What’s more, Schlafly’s own daughter, Anne Cori, has sided with the other Cruz supporters inside Eagle Forum against her mother, creating a divide inside the family as Phyllis and her other children, including son Andy, back Trump over Cruz in the 2016 primary. Cori admits that her actions run counter to her mother’s wishes, but says she is acting out of “love” for her mother. For the first time here, the inside story of Schlafly’s battle for survival —  including exclusive interviews with her, her daughter who’s working against her, and several of the others involved —  will be told. In dueling Breitbart interviews, both Schlafly and Cori detail how painful this has been for both of them —  and how it’s torn apart one of America’s leading conservative families. This story offers a front row view into how Cruz allies operate throughout the conservative movement. They have aggressively pressured conservatives into publicly supporting the senator —  or at least not supporting someone else —  and even sought to “blacklist” those who don’t, so as to fit Cruz’s narrative of being the one candidate who the conservative movement “united” behind. At one point, according to Eagle Forum president Ed Martin, Cruz allies inside Eagle Forum wrote a press release that they demanded Schlafly sign onto before the Iowa caucuses. The press release was intended to serve as a sort of statement of neutrality that would walk back the positive comments Schlafly had made about Trump and make clear that she likes Cruz too and hadn’t endorsed anyone. But Schlafly resisted these pressures, refusing to sign their statement before the Iowa caucuses and later openly endorsing Trump before the Missouri primary. The story even entangles Cruz’s   campaign manager Jeff Roe, a political operative with deep ties in Missouri politics —  Schlafly’s home base for half a century, where her endorsement of Trump carried great weight. Roe had been lobbying Schlafly’s handpicked successor Ed Martin for weeks to get Eagle Forum on Cruz’s side. Martin says that by doing so, Roe “inserted himself” into this   dispute. A lot of the dispute centers around internal Eagle Forum emails that were leaked out to the Cruz campaign and made their way to Roe. In the emails, Schlafly’s son Andy brutally criticized the Texas Senator and his wife Heidi, even making the explosive charge that the Cruzes are “feminists. ” In a roundabout way, thanks to Schlafly’s daughter Anne Cori and fellow Eagle Forum board rebel Cathie Adams of Texas, those emails were leaked to Roe —  and Roe confronted Martin with them. Roe doesn’t deny confronting Martin about the emails, but he does deny deeper conversations with Martin about Schlafly’s position on the election. Martin says Roe is lying, LISTEN TO ED MARTIN ON BREITBART NEWS DAILY ON SIRIUSXM: Meanwhile, all of this coming to light adds a renewed focus to the core issues Schlafly believes are of utmost importance. As the drama unfolds, immigration, education, trade, and, most importantly, national sovereignty, are back at the forefront, Schlafly told Breitbart News in a nearly   interview. Schlafly has led Eagle Forum ever since she founded the organization back in 1972. She has fought against the Institutional Left and GOP establishment, elites she calls “the kingmakers,” for decades. Now she’s fighting internally for survival, and she’s fighting back hard against several rebels who’ve been around her for decades. Schlafly has already largely regained control of parts of the organization, but the plotters against her claim that they have control of one of Eagle Forum’s three wings. The organization will likely litigate whether that wing of Eagle Forum, a   part of the group that is technically a 501( c)(4) will remain under Schlafly’s control, but she and her allies have successfully booted the rebels from the 501( c)(3) wing already. Last Friday, they fired several people involved in or close to the coup attempt, and officially they are now barred from publicly identifying themselves with the Eagle Forum 501( c)(3) wing. Eagle Forum is split into three separate parts: A 501( c)(3) a 501( c)(4) and a political action committee (PAC). Last week, for the first time in the organization’s   history, a group of Eagle Forum 501( c)(4) board members called for a special meeting of the board. At least two of those Eagle Forum board members who called for this meeting are supportive of Ted Cruz: Cathie Adams of Texas and Eunie Smith of Alabama. Shirley Curry of Tennessee, the third board member who called for the meeting, hasn’t publicly confirmed whom she is backing in the presidential race, but sources close to the goings on believe she is a Cruz supporter. The special meeting of the 501( c)(4) board happened on Monday, April 11 —  and, rather than taking place in person as normal board meetings have since the 1970s, the meeting happened over the phone. An email was sent to all the 11 board members announcing that Ed Martin, the organization’s president and former chairman of the Missouri GOP who is Schlafly’s chosen successor, would not be leading the meeting. The Cruz supporters attempting the coup d’etat against Schlafly would refuse to recognize Martin as the officiator of the meeting. The people who called the meeting were Adams, Smith and Curry. In the lead up to that Monday meeting, Martin —  at Schlafly’s direction with the involvement of her son John as well —  made several moves that further infuriated the   rebels. On the previous Friday morning, Martin fired Glyn Wright as executive director of Eagle Forum. Martin confirmed to Breitbart News that he fired Wright on Friday, and the reasoning was “disloyalty” to Schlafly. The news of Wright’s departure came as a shock to many in the conservative movement, as Wright for the past several years has been a core leader in Eagle Forum’s Capitol Hill operations. Wright herself has not responded to repeated phone calls or text messages seeking comment about her termination. Also on Friday morning, Martin used the 501( c)(3) wing of Eagle Forum —  again, at Schlafly’s direction —  to terminate the involvement of several of the 501( c)(4) wing rebels against Schlafly. The five who were terminated for the actions against Eagle Forum and against Schlafly are: Cathie Adams of Texas, Eunie Smith of Alabama, Shirley Curry of Tennessee, Rosina Kovar of Colorado and Carolyn McLarty of Oklahoma. All except Curry have offered public support for Cruz’s campaign. McLarty is a Republican National Committeewoman from Oklahoma —  and the Cruz campaign prominently celebrated her endorsement of the senator’s presidential bid with a press release. In that 501( c)(3) emergency meeting that Martin called on Friday, which was held via telephone, a number of board members also had successors elected. People close to Schlafly have long been skeptical of Adams’ motives due to comments Adams made to the Dallas Morning News earlier this cycle alleging that Schlafly’s endorsement of Trump was a “manipulation. ” The term suggests that the    Schlafly is no longer capable of making such decisions on her own anymore. “We have no respect for that man,” Adams told the Dallas newspaper of Trump back in  . “[Schlafly’s endorsement] is going to be widely dismissed. At 91, it is just totally unfair to impose upon someone who has such a beautiful legacy   …     I think this was very much a manipulation. When you’re 91 and you’re not out with the grass roots all the time, it is very much taking advantage of someone. ” Schlafly’s endorsement of Trump came with a pledge from the GOP frontrunner to support the Republican Platform, which is full of policy positions that grassroots conservatives like. But, Adams told the Dallas Morning News, she believes Cruz is better than Trump with the platform. “If we were going to be asking Ted Cruz about the platform, he would be able to give us a wonderful dissertation on each one of those plans. That is the caliber of the man,” Adams said. “Where with Donald Trump he says he going to bully people, negotiate with people, he’s going to have good people around him. That’s it. And that is going to make America great? Really?” Adams has since apologized to Schlafly over the phone last week over those comments but hasn’t asked the Dallas Morning News to retract or change them —  and told Breitbart News that she was talking about Trump, not Schlafly, when she used the word “manipulation” in that quote to the Dallas Morning News. “OK, let me ask you a question: Who do you think is being looked at in a way that is negative —  do you think it’s Phyllis Schlafly?” Adams responded when Breitbart News read her that Dallas Morning News quote and asked her what she meant. “No, what I’m asking you though is do you think she was manipulated into endorsing Trump?” Breitbart News asked Adams directly as a  . “What I feel and was trying to say and maybe I didn’t say it as articulately as I could have and should have is that I have, as I said, no respect for Donald Trump,” Adams replied. “And I hit him. So my negative was not in any way intended for Phyllis Schlafly. I love and adore her. I would be hurt more than I can even express if I hurt Phyllis Schlafly. I don’t really think it’s fair to call —  it would certainly be an uninformed statement to say that I ever would do anything that would be hurtful to Phyllis Schlafly. But I don’t mind at all telling you that I intended to hurt Donald Trump. That comment, what I was trying to say, was that I don’t support Donald Trump. ” “Right, but again, you said you think it was ‘very much a manipulation,’” Breitbart News followed up again. “What did you mean by that?” “I think that Donald Trump, when he speaks that he is a very good salesman,” Adams replied. “I think that maiming people who are my friends are not understanding clearly the role that he has played in this and that he thinks he can turn the American government into him just being a CEO. So any negative there, please make it very, very clear that this is a reflection not upon Phyllis Schlafly but upon Donald Trump. ” “OK, but you think she was clear in her  …     Is she just the same as she’s always been and able to make an endorsement, I mean she’s been doing this for a half a century?” Breitbart News asked Adams in another   question. “I think that Phyllis Schlafly is just as free today to anchor herself and be able to choose a candidate as she’s always been able to,” Adams replied. “We have had times in the past where we would disagree over a candidate, and this has not been a divisive point at all. But why is it more of a point now? I think it’s because of the stuff of Trump. It has nothing to do with Phyllis. It’s not Phyllis’ ability to make decisions and to think —  it’s not any of that. Any negative [I’ve said] focuses on Donald Trump period. Nothing on Phyllis Schlafly. But absolutely no pulling of punches on Donald Trump. If you would write something to that effect, I would be forever grateful. ” Adams’ central role in this story connects all the way back to emails she was leaking to Ted Cruz’s campaign. She admitted to Breitbart News that she leaked the emails, in which Eagle Forum board member and Phyllis Schlafly’s son Andy Schlafly was critical of Cruz and his wife Heidi, to the Cruz campaign. The emails, which Andy Schlafly sent to his mother Phyllis and copied her daughter Ann Cori, ended up being forwarded to Adams by Cori. Adams then sent them to the Cruz campaign —  not directly to Jeff Roe, but they eventually made their way to Roe. Roe is Cruz’s campaign manager, known for his aggressive political style. Roe comes from Missouri politics, too, just like many of these Eagle Forum players —  and has a personal relationship that dates back years with Ed Martin. Adams —  who has been a Cruz supporter for years and is heavily involved in Texas politics, having been the former Texas Republican Party chair —  claimed that she didn’t know until a couple days ago who Cruz’s presidential campaign manager was. Adams is currently running for the vice chair slot of the Texas Republican Party. “I was surprised to even hear —  I hate to express ignorance here —  I didn’t even know who Jeff Roe was until I heard his name earlier this week,” Adams told Breitbart News when asked if she forwarded the emails to Roe himself. “No, I don’t think I’ve ever met him. I mean, I know Ted Cruz and I’ve been a supporter of his from the very beginning of the U. S. Senate race. I’m a very, very avid supporter of Ted Cruz’s, but, no, I didn’t know Mr. Roe. I’ve never had any interaction with him. ” Roe, in an interview for this story, confirmed that he doesn’t know Adams and hadn’t interacted with her specifically. Adams, however, did admit to leaking internal Eagle Forum emails to the Cruz campaign. “Well, yes, I am not going to deny that —  it was a friend, a mutual friend from Eagle Forum,” Adams said when asked if she gave emails from inside Eagle Forum to anyone on the Cruz campaign. “I did share an email. But I don’t know Roe, and I’ve never spoken with Jeff about anything. ” Adams wouldn’t say who specifically she leaked the emails to. “Of course I do,” Adams said when asked if she knew which Cruz staffer she leaked the Schlafly emails to. “But I don’t want to get someone in trouble. Whatever that person did with it, it’s their own business. When I see things that hurt my candidate, I think that is something that is very much expected. A friend is a friend, and we’re going to stick up for our friends. ” In two emails which went to his mother Phyllis Schlafly and his sister Anne Cori among others, Andy Schlafly argued that both Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi Cruz are “feminist. ” He also calls Ted Cruz “  Ted” and argued that believing Cruz was a U. S. citizen at the time of his birth in Calgary, Canada, would be like “supporting birthright citizenship” that would ultimately be “hurtful to our immigration positions, on which Trump is so strong. ” The argument that Cruz is somehow a feminist —  and that his wife is too —  is new. Schlafly and Eagle Forum have been fighting against the feminist worldview for decades, and her family stands with her on it. She fought and killed the Equal Rights Amendment, which was being pushed as an effort to amend the U. S. Constitution, and has consistently and repeatedly battled feminists over the course of her career.  Andy Schlafly sent this email, sources confirmed, to Eunie Smith and her assistant Deborah Love. It was sent on the evening of Jan. 12, 2016, as the battle between Cruz and Trump intensified on the campaign trail in Iowa. The email subject heading line reads: “reply to Deborah Re: Ted Cruz’s wife is a feminist. ” It’s unclear if Smith personally leaked this to the Cruz team, or if Love did —  or if they sent it to someone else who sent it to the Cruz team. But it made its way to Roe soon. “Thanks for your insightful comments,” Andy wrote in the first email obtained by Breitbart News. “But my mother has not endorsed Trump.  She has praised several of his courageous positions. If Trump fails early, then those conservative positions go down with him. I don’t want that. Whatever flaws Trump has, he is not a feminist. Ted and Heidi Cruz obviously are,  . Eagle Forum stands, first and foremost, against feminism. In addition, in my humble opinion, supporting birthright citizenship for   Ted at this critical time is hurtful to our immigration positions, on which Trump is so strong. Many, many times fellow conservatives have declared my mother to be wrong on a particular issue, while praising her generally. And every single time that I can think of, my mother ended up being right. Call it intuition, Providence, luck, or whatever, my mother has a certain knack for politics that has virtually never been wrong. I learned that the hard way until I accepted it. ” In a second email from Andy Schlafly —  sent on Jan. 27, 2016, to several Eagle Forum board members, many of whom are also his family members —  he wrote that like the Cruzes, who are “complete feminists,” the Fox News Channel has been taken over by “the pushy feminist Megyn Kelly. ” That email was sent to several people on the board at Eagle Forum, including Phyllis Schlafly and Anne Cori. Cori confirmed she forwarded the private email onto several other people, including Adams. It was Adams who sent it to the Cruz campaign —  which eventually got it into Roe’s hands. Adams admitted she leaked the email to the Cruz campaign, and Cori admitted she blasted the email out to several people including Adams. Roe wasn’t sure which one of his staffers he got the email from. “Donald Trump is the only candidate who stands up against the feminists,” Andy Schlafly wrote in this Jan. 27 email. “Fox News Channel has apparently been completely taken over by the pushy feminist Megyn Kelly, to the point of doing voters an immense disservice and losing millions of viewers. Heidi and Ted Cruz are complete feminists and investment banker Heidi is both running Ted’s campaign and dictating his policy positions. We already will have Hillary on the ballot in November and I don’t see why Republicans should nominate a feminist candidate on our side, too. Eagle Forum, first and foremost, is against feminism. ” Cori’s explanation for blasting the private email out to Adams and others was that she thought it wasn’t confidential —  and she thought her brother would support it getting out. “There was no indication on that email that that was confidential, so I thought he was quite proud of that statement, and I didn’t see any reason not to forward it, so I forwarded it because it’s clearly something he believes,” Cori said of her brother’s communiqué. “I actually sent it to about 30 people, and beyond that who knows —  it could have went anywhere from that point. ” Even so, Cori did deny sending them directly to the Cruz campaign. “No, no, because I don’t have any connection with the Cruz campaign,” she said when asked if she gave it directly to the campaign. What’s perhaps most interesting about these emails is how Roe handled them: The Missourian took the emails to Ed Martin, the president of Eagle Forum and his old friend from Missouri, to tell Martin they needed to talk about it. “[C]an you call me to discuss? I need to take this to TC,” Roe wrote to Martin on Jan. 23 in an email that contained Andy Schlafly’s original Jan. 12 email. Roe confirmed to Breitbart News that “TC” means “Ted Cruz. ” “That’s what I commonly refer to Ted as, yeah,” Roe said in a phone interview. Though he said it in this email that he was going to take the email up to Ted Cruz himself, Roe told Breitbart News when asked if he did: “Nah, I never did. ” The second email, the Jan. 27 one, went from Roe in a text message to Martin. The text message didn’t contain anything other than Andy Schlafly’s email content. In the case of both emails, Roe says he is not sure how they got to him —  whether it be from someone inside his campaign who sent them up to him, or from someone outside. He also originally thought they were mass email blasts, not private emails that leaked their way up to him. “I’m sure it was forwarded from a variety of people, but I got that email from several folks,” Roe said. “It’s probably like I get the letters that they sent out today —  I counted before our conversation, I got probably 25. I got those the same way —  there were a half a dozen people who were forwarding information around that time,” Roe added. “I wanted to just at some point —  obviously, Phyllis is a giant, and I don’t know her son. It wasn’t that long prior that I think Ted had been there, I think to their meeting. So I wanted to track down if this was in fact a position statement or if this was really the feelings going on internally and what we could do to clean this up. ” On the second email, Roe said it was the “same thing” and that “I got that from several” different people. “There was wide discussion about the position that they were going to take in the presidential campaign at that time,” Roe said. Roe told Breitbart News that “nah,” he never ended up actually speaking with Martin about them. But Martin says that’s not true. When asked about the emails from inside her Eagle Forum leaking out to the Cruz campaign, Phyllis Schlafly told Breitbart News she’s not happy about it —  but she turned her attention quickly to Heidi Cruz, the   First Lady of the United States, for signing onto that CFR paper calling for a North American Union. Back when she was at the Council on Foreign Relations, Heidi Cruz —  Ted’s wife —  signed onto a paper backing one of the most radical globalist and open borders ideas in history: The creation of a North American Union. That hasn’t gotten much attention on the campaign trail, but it has been picked up on by a lot of the grassroots. “I’m not in favor of leaking anything or forwarding anybody else’s emails without permission, I’m not in favor of that,” Schlafly said in the interview. “But I will tell you I spent about a year of my life fighting the issue of trying to put the United States in the North American Union. I thought that would have erased our northern and southern borders. I’m very much opposed to that. I like the United States borders we have now, and I have recently learned that Mrs. Cruz was one of the authors of the CFR [Council on Foreign Relations] article that endorsed the North American Union. And as I said, I devoted a lot of my life to fighting this dumb idea of combining our country with any other countries. ” She wouldn’t back up the claim from her son Andy in those private emails that Sen. Cruz is a feminist and wouldn’t expand on the claim that Heidi Cruz is a feminist, other than to say she has heard the criticism of the   First Lady. “Well, I never heard anybody say Cruz was a feminist, but they have said that about his wife,” Schlafly said. Schlafly next explained feminism and why it’s not good for society. “A feminist has their goals, and one of their goals is to change the Constitution to add the Equal Rights Amendment —  that’s what they worked so hard on —  and they’re always trying to push the feminist goal, and I think the feminists are not good for our country,” she said. “For example, women in combat was another big issue for us when the ERA came up in the 70s. The feminists wanted to get women drafted and treated just like men. We opposed that. We oppose women in combat. I just haven’t heard the Cruzes speak out against women in combat. ” When asked about the “feminist” criticism in his interview with Breitbart News, Roe laughed it off. “I haven’t either, that’s why I wanted to talk to Ed,” Roe said when this reporter noted he hasn’t heard that criticism of Cruz before this ever. “I don’t have any reaction. It’s obviously a lot of drama going on over there. I don’t have much to add, but it’s a silly accusation. ” Roe did however point to a New York Times article in which Team Trump seems to be floating all over the place on the issue of feminism without a clear or defined point of view on the matter. It is a similar problem that has cropped up with Trump on issues like abortion or marriage or certain elements of defense policy —  or really anything he has not yet randomly come across and learned —  where he does not have a stated policy position and relies on pure instinct. In an article filed from Milwaukee on the day before Cruz trounced Trump in the Wisconsin primary, the New York Times’ Ashley Parker wrote about Trump’s complicated issues with women in light of a recent interview Ivana Trump did with the New York Post. Ivana Trump’s team, Parker’s article explained, didn’t appear to understand whether Donald Trump was a feminist or not. “A spokeswoman for Ivana Trump, Catherine Saxton, said the interview was simply the result of good timing  —   The Post asked, and Ms. Trump was able to do it,” Parker wrote. “(At one point during the interview Mr. Trump even called his  .) Yet in a sign of Mr. Trump’s complicated relationship with women, Ivana Trump’s staff later called the paper to say Mr. Trump was, in fact, a feminist, before calling again to say he was not  —   and then calling a final time to say he was, indeed, a feminist. ” While Schlafly hadn’t officially endorsed a candidate in the 2016 presidential primary until March, when she endorsed Trump in St. Louis before the March 15 Missouri primary, she had spoken very highly of Trump in a variety of interviews before the Iowa caucuses. The populist and nationalist wing of the conservative grassroots has viewed Cruz as a second choice of sorts to Trump. If Trump couldn’t make it, they believed, Cruz wasn’t a bad alternative. There was even what appeared to be an alliance between the two candidates for the first several months of the campaign, as they avoided attacking each other while they each battled the rest of the GOP field. But Schlafly had done several interviews praising Trump without necessarily officially endorsing him. That undercut Cruz’s narrative, which was —  and still is —  that the conservative movement was uniting behind him. It is the tactic Cruz used to box out everyone from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to Dr. Ben Carson to Sen. Rand Paul ( ) to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Trump’s support from a longtime movement leader, one who Cruz personally idolized and who shared a home state with his campaign manager, hurt that carefully crafted image. “Jeff Roe inserted himself in this,” Martin told Breitbart News. “Listen, he’s lying,” Martin said when told that Roe denied speaking with him about this particular stuff. “He and I talked about this in December, I told him about —  look, I’m not bragging but I know the rules. I talked to him in December, and he said, ‘Come work for us on these rules stuff,’ and I said, ‘No, I can’t do that.’ I talked to him personally, texted regularly, up until right before Iowa. What they’re really mad about is that Phyllis met with Anne Cori and a few other Eagles and they said, ‘We need you to put out a statement that says you’re not really for Trump —  will you do that?’ So, Phyllis, as Phyllis does, said —  and she called me right after —  said, ‘I just told them I’d think about it.’ Now, for Phyllis, that’s her way of saying, ‘No.’ She doesn’t say ‘no’ directly to people she knows. The next day, this is Friday before Iowa, Roe was texting saying, ‘I need to talk to you’ because he wanted a statement. I suspect Anne Cori and Cathie Adams had predicted, and promised, that they would get a statement out of Phyllis. ” Martin said that leading up to the Iowa caucuses, Cruz backers led a pressure campaign against Schlafly to try to get her to issue a statement saying she backed no one —  neither Cruz or Trump. “The thing that’s crazy about this, the thing that’s silly, if you look at her writings over the last seven or eight months, she had written about Trump and Cruz, and she had written about the issues as you know,” Martin said. “So her perspective was that both those guys had made really good progress on the issues, and yet she was still really assessing it all. So it’s the week before Iowa, the Cruz people are amped up, and they’re trying to force Phyllis to put a statement out. So I went to see Phyllis after this meeting, and she said, ‘What do you think I should do?’ I said, ‘What do you want to do?’ She said, ‘I don’t want to say anything.’ She said, ‘If I say something now, the Friday before Iowa, it’ll be all over Iowa.’ And in fact, her daughter ran a   into Iowa the Sunday of that weekend. And again Phyllis’s point is, again, ‘People are going to do what people are going to do, and I’m not going to sweat it. But I’m not going to have people force me into having to do anything.’ Roe in the middle of that called me and said, ‘Hey, I need to talk to you,’ and I said, ‘Hey, I’m in the middle of my weekend with the Eagles. I’ll call you Monday. ’” Martin says it’s clear to him looking back on it all. “His response, I can picture it now, he said, ‘Ha,’” Martin said. “Because he knew I knew what they were doing. They were trying to get Phyllis to be the big story, ‘Phyllis Schlafly softens statements on Trump.’ The point is, she didn’t fall for it. Those guys all think I was the one [who made that happen] but [what really happened] is when I got to her house I said, ‘What do you want to do?’ She said, ‘I don’t want to put out a statement.’ So I said, ‘Then don’t put out a statement.’ Then she said, ‘It’s really getting people upset.’ Then I said, ‘Well, do what you want.’ But they had drafted a statement they wanted from her, and it read like a Cruz press release, and she said, ‘I’m not doing this.’ So for him [Roe] to say that he hasn’t talked to me, that’s just —  again, I can just tell you, he’s from Missouri, I’m from Missouri. I talked to every campaign except for Jeb [Bush] all the way through, I talked to Carly [Fiorina] I actually didn’t talk to [Marco] Rubio much  …     but I talked to [Ben] Carson, Carly, I even talked to Jim Gilmore regularly. ” However, like Adams and Smith and all those on the side against Schlafly, Roe believes that this whole storyline does not appear to relate too much to the internal divisions at Eagle Forum. Instead, he thinks it more has to do with many of the Eagles’ views on Martin. The narrative those against Schlafly put forward is that Martin is the real problem, not Schlafly. Roe supported this point of view in his interview with Breitbart News. “It’s sad to see an organization that’s been a leader in the conservative movement and truly an iconic person in Ms. Schlafly —  that’s been a leader in the conservative movement for generations —  it’s sad to see,” Roe said. “From my reading, I’ve not —  I don’t know anything except for what I read. But I don’t know if it’s as much as strife between internal [forces] in an organization as it is a result of the presidential. There’s obviously a divide in who they all supported, but that’s not uncommon in presidential campaigns. At this level it’s uncommon, but there’s probably other factors at play than just the presidential. This looks like it’s beyond just who’s supporting whom for president because the group has also had kind things to say, and Ted has been an advocate of the organization and views Phyllis in high regard. So I think it’s more to do with internal things than external presidency. Until you called me yesterday, I’d not been paying hardly any attention to it and hadn’t heard about any of these much outside of what was being publicly reported about what was going on. ” Schlafly herself believes that presidential politics is at least one of the driving motives of those who have plotted against her inside Eagle Forum. “Well, I don’t think that’s the main cause. I think that may be being used by some people because I think our organization is pretty well divided between Trump and Cruz,” Schlafly said when asked if the divide between Cruz and Trump is the reason behind this infighting. “We have a lot of people supporting Trump, and we have a lot of people supporting Cruz, and Cruz people had attempted to make an Eagle Forum endorsement a couple years ago, but I said we have free speech and anybody can endorse anyone she wants. I endorsed Trump when he came to St. Louis and gave that big event, and I did it because he endorsed the Republican platform, which has been the major focus of a lot of the work I’ve done in politics. The one we passed at the last convention is truly a great platform that’s right on all the issues —  right on life, right on marriage, right on what I’m particularly interested in which is national sovereignty and military sovereignty. I don’t think it’s enough, I’m not satisfied with language like ‘a strong national defense.’ I feel that we’re stronger when we’re the best in the world, and I think that the world likes that too because our friends feel safe when we have military superiority. ” Tensions flared even more Sunday night as Schlafly took two actions in the hours leading up to Monday’s telephone conference. Schlafly sent a letter to Cori, McLarty, Curry, Smith, Adams and Kovar calling for them to resign their positions on the board effective immediately. “I write this letter with a heavy heart,” Schlafly wrote to her longtime friends in the short one page letter, obtained by Breitbart News. “For over a week now, I have tried to understand what you are doing and what you intend. Some of you have delayed returning my calls while others have not responded at all. Over the past few days I have heard different versions of what you intend with the board meeting tomorrow. First, it was a question about how we have operated and Eunie said she thought we needed outsiders at Eagle Forum. Next, a reporter told us Cathie is saying this is about planning the future. Finally, this morning Eunie said this is about my judgment on personnel. I don’t know what the true plan is but I believe it is an attack on me and my work. I have fond memories of our work together and our friendships. I will cherish those. At this time, I ask you to resign immediately from the Board so that I may continue with Eagle Forum’s important work. ” Phyllis Request for Resignations April 10, 2016. pdf by Wynn Marlow,  The second move Schlafly made against the plotters was the hiring of legal counsel that ordered them to immediately cease and desist all activities related to this coup. The legal counsel’s letter, sent on Sunday to all six, notified them that any actions they planned to take at the meeting on Monday would be beyond their legal authority and therefore void from the outset. Also, their call to a meeting —  the official meeting notice —  was as such “null and void. ” “Eagle Forum therefore demands that you immediately cease and desist any actions to move forward with that meeting,” the letter sent to all six, also obtained by Breitbart News, reads. “Eagle Forum further demands that you cease and desist all actions you are taking or may take that violate your fiduciary duties to Eagle Forum. Be advised that any actions you take in violation of your fiduciary duties to Eagle Forum will result in your being personally liable for any damages caused. ” The letter, from attorney Stephen R. Clark of the St.   Runnymeade Law Group who also serves as the president of the St. Louis Federalist Society, went on to order the preservation of all documents by these rogue board members. It also noted that Eagle Forum will “consider taking legal action” against any of these people involved in this action especially if they go public with statements that are untrue about what is going on inside the organization. ceaseanddesistletterfinal. pdf by Wynn Marlow,  When the time came on Monday for the impromptu board meeting conference call, all sides were dug in. The board members were determined to remove Martin from his post. The new steps Schlafly took in the interim had escalated matters further. The rebels were not backing down —  and they were moving forward with their runaway board meeting despite Schlafy’s and her lawyers’ warnings that doing so was not within their power. On this conference call board meeting, they ran down a list of things they intended to accomplish. First, they passed a motion terminating Martin as the president of Eagle Forum. Then they moved forward with a motion to seize the bank accounts of Eagle Forum and then through other parts of their agenda. Schlafly blasted them in a statement shortly after the meeting. “At 2 p. m. today, 6 directors of Eagle Forum met in an improper, unprecedented telephone meeting,” Schlafly said in the statement, which was publicly distributed by Martin. “I objected to the meeting and at 2:11pm, I was muted from the call. The meeting was invalid under the Bylaws but the attendees purported to pass several motions to wrest control of the organization from me. They are attempting to seize access to our bank accounts, to terminate employees, and to install members of their own Gang of 6 to control the bank accounts and all of Eagle Forum. The members of their group are: Eunie Smith of Alabama, Anne Cori of Missouri, Cathie Adams of Texas, Rosina Kovar of Colorado, Shirley Curry of Tennessee, and Carolyn McLarty of Oklahoma. This kind of conduct will not stand and I will fight for Eagle Forum and I ask all men and women of good will to join me in this fight. ” In response to that, the plotters against Schlafly blasted out a press release of their own that reported Phyllis Schlafly was on the call for the full meeting —  implying that Schlafly was involved in their decisions and, somehow, supported them. Their release did not say she objected to everything they did with her organization. “The Board of Eagle Forum, a 501( c)(4) corporation, held a Board meeting in accordance with and pursuant to the Eagle Forum   and Illinois State Law at 2 pm CDT on April 11, 2016,” the release reads. “Pursuant to the   Eagle Forum First Vice President, Eunie Smith, presided over the meeting.  Eagle Forum Founder, Mrs. Phyllis Schlafly, the Chairman of the Board, was present during the entire meeting, including expressing herself on all seven votes. In Schlafly’s opening statement she said she has spent her life building Eagle Forum as a unique organization of volunteers.  She also said that paid staff cannot order volunteers around. ” Martin told Breitbart News that this characterization of Schlafly’s involvement in this meeting was unfair and inaccurate. “Under the law, you can listen and hear what’s going on and be present only for the person of objecting,” Martin said of what happened on the call. “This is why they’re cynical —  they’re cynical and not telling the truth. Phyllis at the beginning of the meeting said, ‘Before the meeting begins, I would like to say the following: I object to this meeting taking place over the phone, we’ve always met in person, it’s outside of the bylaws, and I want to say this. I always had volunteers —  we were always volunteer and we always worked together —  so why this is happening, and I think this organization is too important and I object.’ Then the lawyer said she will be staying on the call, per her rights, to listen. And she could only participate, every single vote was   with an objection from Phyllis, and that was because under the law —  and I said to her because I knew they were going to ask her, ‘Phyllis, they’re going to say you were there the whole time.’ And she said, ‘I’m staying to hear what they say about my organization. ’” Martin continued by noting that this conversation between himself and Schlafly happened in the presence of their lawyers, and that one lawyer recommended that they leave the meeting before they proceeded with their plans to decimate Eagle Forum and Schlafly’s mission. Schlafly, stubborn as ever, insisted on hearing what they had to say about her organization —  the only reason why she stayed on the call. “So I looked at the lawyers, and one lawyer had recommended we not stay. We’re legally entitled to, but he didn’t think we’d want to, but I said, ‘Listen, you don’t tell Phyllis [what to do]. When she wants to do something, that’s how it goes,’” Martin said. “And then they put out a press release on Phyllis Schlafly. Today there’s a rumor mill email saying that Phyllis is not mentally healthy which is, you know, an actual slur. Now, they’re spinning it saying she’s penalized for staying on the phone call where their purported actions were removing leadership, questioning Phyllis’ personnel decisions, trying to take the banks. I mean, it’s incredible stuff. And by the way, the breach of their fiduciary duty to the organization is significant, and they will be personally liable. Eunie [Smith] is sending emails all over the place, and she’s sending them to the wrong people, who are not employees, and she’s causing herself [legal trouble]. ” Both Smith and Adams, in interviews on the Friday before the meeting, denied outright that the purpose for all of this was to remove Schlafly —  and promised that there would be no such effort. Adams was particularly colorful with her allusions to Schlafly’s age, and it’s among these different interviews that the story about the reasoning for all of this among the   “Gang of 6” begins to change. “You know, when you have a leader who is doing such a fabulous job for 50 years and is so capable and just so right on,” Adams told Breitbart News when asked to explain the purpose of calling the meeting. “There’s a couple things that happened. First of all, we get bored because the need for a board is so minimal with such a fine leader. And then hopefully she passes the baton and is preparing for retirement. Phyllis Schlafly is so brilliant and so capable she’ll never fully retire until the Lord takes her home, but when you have a person in that place —  and, yes, it is likely that some things are going to be a little bit different than from what has been done in the past. So, we are very much entering that transition front with the woman that we absolutely love and adore. ” In a   question, Breitbart News asked Adams directly if she meant that Schlafly was incapable of leading Eagle Forum because of her age. She said that’s not what she meant, but again repeated the line “until the Lord calls her home. ” “No, I’m not saying that at all. No, no. I’m just saying that there needs to be a transition in place for the future,” Adams said. “When you’re 91 years old, that’s something that Phyllis has made a very deliberate plan to pass on as much information to volunteers. This [Eagle Forum] is Phyllis   from the beginning and all the way until the Lord calls her home. This is absolutely Phyllis Schlafly centered. ” Over the course of several questions and answers later in the interview, Adams repeatedly kept referring back to Phyllis Schlafly’s age —  and that she didn’t want to leave anything to “chance,” and that Schlafly has shown more “frailty” in recent years. Below is a transcript of that section of the interview: BREITBART NEWS NETWORK (BNN): “Since 1972, there has never been a special meeting called like this —  of the board?” ADAMS: “Well, Phyllis hasn’t been in this particular place before where she is preparing for the future of Eagle Forum even if she is not there. Phyllis Schlafly’s agenda is to do that. As the board, we feel responsible to come along her side and be a blessing to her. That is what this is all about. For anyone to spin otherwise, it’s like ‘oh my goodness. What is your motive? ’” BNN: “So this is for planning for the future and everything, but again why do it in the way that is ‘call a special meeting’ like this? Is there not a regular order way to do this rather than calling an emergency meeting?” ADAMS: “Well, actually, board meetings being once a year, when they are going through this transition that Phyllis has initiated, it really does require a more than just once a year meeting. And I don’t know if I’ve even said this to you, but my father is 91, he’s the same age, and he lives with us. When he has the will to be drafted, or a change in his will, or whatever, we don’t wait for six months or whatever to take care of it because he wants it done sooner rather than later. We don’t know what the future holds we have absolutely no idea the number of our days —  only the Lord knows that. And so, it’s not an extreme measure to say that we want to meet more than once a year and calling the bylaws requires three of the board members to do anything, so the three board members are the first vice president, the second vice president —  and I’m the second vice president, by the way —  and then a woman who was sitting at the table coming up with the name Eagle Forum when Phyllis Schlafly started the organization. The three of us, who absolutely love and adore and want everything done according to Phyllis’s will, should be accomplished and not to leave anything to chance. I think you don’t leave anything to chance. When we are responsible as board members, we just don’t want to leave it to chance. We want her will to be accomplished. ” BNN: “Ok, now every single one of you guys who called this —  so, you, Eunie, Shirley, Rosina and Carolyn —  are all Cruz supporters, right?” ADAMS: “This is not about Cruz and Trump, but, yes, that is a fact. But that is not what this is about. That, of course, is something that we knew was a lift in calling this. ” BNN: “So, she’s 91. Why not do this when she was 75? Why not do this when she was 80? Why not do this when she was 85? Why not do this when she was 90? Why wait until now in the middle of a presidential election?” ADAMS: “I think the difference is she was much more —  at 75, Phyllis Schlafly was wearing me out, when I was a much younger age. It’s just now that we are seeing the need for being responsible for our duties as board members and as far as in a presidential election or whatever, it’s just —  it’s not a presidential issue. There are needs, and just a timeframe of uncertainty that has culminated. It’s not presidential. ” BNN: “So what changed from when she was 90, or 85 —  this year —  that you guys have to call for this? What has changed in her behavior or the way that she’s been leading the organization? What’s different this year?” ADAMS: “There have been some changes over the past couple of years that we have as a board decided, so it’s time for us to revisit some of those and make sure we’re on the right track and make sure that we’re going in the right direction according to the mission that Phyllis has laid out. I assure you it has nothing in any way whatsoever to do with hurting Phyllis Schlafly. And, no, the intent is not —  that is the nuttiest thing in the world —  to remove her from the board. That is just crazy. ” BNN: “Again, what I’m trying to get at here is: Is there something different about Phyllis this year than last year or the year before that or the year before that? I mean, she was in her high 80s and then 90?” ADAMS: “Maybe some more frailty. I mean, she’s not traveling as much —  she’s still traveling, she’s still doing well. I just think it’s not anything bad or emergency or anything like that, no. But there is more frailty than there was five years ago, 10 years ago. My father, who is even more mobile —  still driving and so on —  if he decides there needs to be a change of some sort, we don’t [delay]. We get it taken care of. We don’t know when the Lord is going to call him home. Maybe, in my own mind and my own heart, because my father lives with us, maybe that was part of my thinking. It maybe changed some of my thinking, made me more aware of a need to prepare for the future because of my own home and my own father moving in with us. ” After Adams stated that she didn’t intend to do anything to “hurt” Schlafly, Breitbart News asked: “If I’m understanding you correctly, you intend to support Phyllis remaining as the head of the organization? You keep saying that you don’t want to do anything to hurt her, but does that mean you want her to remain as the head of Eagle Forum —  all of the different umbrellas of it?” “Absolutely,” Adams replied. “Absolutely. It is the most cruel thing for anyone to intimate that someone would in any way whatsoever say that Eagle Forum is not yours. That is just unconscionable. ” But Schlafly’s own daughter Cori would make no such commitment when asked multiple times directly if there were plans at a forthcoming May 2 board meeting to remove Schlafly as the chair of the board. Below is a transcript of that part of Cori’s half hour interview with Breitbart News: BNN: “At that meeting, will there be an effort to remove any board members?” CORI: “Well, we will find out what happens on that meeting. ” BNN: “OK. ” CORI: “I mean, it’s a board of directors with a lot interesting people, and we will take a vote, and we will abide by the bylaws. ” BNN: “And you’re not intending to remove your mother as chairman of the board at that meeting, are you —  or?” CORI [scoffs]: “I fully love how the scurrilous emails that were put out last week full of lies and innuendoes were intended to make this strange idea about a coup d’état. There is no coup d’état. Because what we have is we have a board of directors who are in charge of the hiring and firing of the paid president. And so that’s what we do. And then we discharge our duty of care for the organization. ” BNN: “OK, but again —  you’re not confirming to me whether or not there’s going to be any effort to remove —  “ CORI: “Well, we’ll just have to —  you know what? That is in the future. We’ll have to have that board meeting. ” BNN: “OK, but can you tell us: Is Phyllis Schlafly going to be the chairman of the board of Eagle Forum at the end of this?” CORI [laughs]: “Well, I think you’re attempting to put words in my mouth on something, and I have no interest in playing into this kind of gotcha questioning. ” BNN: “OK, I’m not trying to ask you a gotcha question. ” CORI: “But that’s what it sounds like, because I’ve already said that to talk speculative about future board meetings is not a good idea. So, then you’re trying to work around the edges then, to say ‘Well, will you do this or will you do that?’ Well, there’s no way around —  I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t in how I answer that question. So, I think the way that you have presented your question is not an acceptable way to present a question. ” BNN: “OK, moving forward here, is there anything else you can tell us about the upcoming board meeting?” CORI: “We have an upcoming board meeting is what I can tell you. ” In her interview with Breitbart News, Phyllis Schlafly said that she is deeply hurt by the fact that not only her longtime friends and board members are turning on her, but also her own daughter. “Yes, it’s very hard,” she said when asked about her daughter Anne Cori’s support for the rebelling board members. “My sons are all very supportive of what I’m doing. Anne seems to have joined the other side. And I’ve not got any criticism for Anne, but she tries to tell me it’s all because of love for me that they’re doing what they’re doing. I kind of laugh. ” When read this quote from Schlafly over the phone in her interview with Breitbart News, Cori responded by saying: “I love my mother. ” After a long silent pause, Breitbart News followed up: “And are you guys doing what you’re doing out of love for Phyllis Schlafly?” “Yes,” Cori replied. Below is a transcript of what happened next: BNN: “OK, and then that gets back to the whole point of why not respect her wishes? Again, she’s made it very clear what she wants. ” CORI: “We are doing this out of love for Phyllis Schlafly. And we feel strongly about it that this is the best. And there is no other guiding motive for our choices and votes yesterday other than our love and respect for Phyllis Schlafly. ” BNN: “OK, and why isn’t she able to make the decision for herself?” CORI: “Well, you’ll have to ask her that. I mean, I’m not going to comment on what she might say to something because that’s speculative. I just know what my actions are, which are love. And I had a beautiful conversation with her last night. ” BNN: “And you just said though that you think that this is best for her, right?” CORI: “Well, no, it’s best for Eagle Forum. ” BNN: “So, if you’re doing this out of love for her —  and  …    ” CORI: “Well, yes, because Eagle Forum is her life’s work. And this is what’s best for Eagle Forum. ” BNN: “OK, and why doesn’t Phyllis Schlafly know what’s best for Eagle Forum?” CORI: “She had a vote on the board. It’s majority rules because we live in a democracy, and we live by the rule of law. ” Another reason for this battle, in addition to the presidential race divisions over Cruz and Trump, is internal strife at Eagle Forum over who should be Schlafly’s successor. Cori, in many ways, believes she should be the one who follows in her mother’s footsteps. But her mother, sources say, tried her out on the state level in Missouri politics close to home and wasn’t impressed with her leadership skills. So, Schlafly set out on the search for a successor and considered former Rep. Michele Bachmann ( ) for some time, but ultimately decided upon Ed Martin. “Well, I have said that, but I don’t know who else would say that,” she said when asked to confirm that Martin was her chosen successor. “I feel entitled to pick my own successor. Everybody knows that most of our people wanted Michele Bachmann, and I had endless conversations with her trying to work out an arrangement, and we never achieved that. So, I had to give up on that, and so then I found Ed, and Ed agrees with me on all the issues. He knows everybody in politics, so that was extremely helpful. ” Cori confirmed multiple times during her interview that she’s aware her mother wants Martin as her successor.  So did Martin. “Now look, Anne Cori —  and this is a well known situation —  was hired in a leadership role at Eagle Forum, and she was kind of not, it’s not her life’s work. She’s never been active in conservative politics beyond the last few years,” Martin told Breitbart News. “You know, she’s Phyllis’s daughter, and she has certain talents, but all I can say is Phyllis asked me to be her successor because she thought I had skills that would let me be able to keep the organization going and succeeding both in politics and the rest of it. Beyond that, that’s sort of a Phyllis question. You won’t get Phyllis Schlafly to say bad words about her family, but there came a moment —  Look, when I became the president, Michele Bachmann made a run at the job she wanted it. Anne Cori talked about [it]. And Phyllis said to her board that ‘Ed is the kind of guy that has the combination of policy, experience and politics, and I want him to be my successor.’ The board voted on it, and for 15 or 16 months it’s been working that way. I don’t know what more to say. ” Phyllis Schlafly’s   nature means she’s scrappy, a   fighter, and certainly doesn’t play victim. It also means she won’t go down without a fight. “Of course, I’ve won all of my fights,” Schlafly told Breitbart News when asked if she’ll win this one too. She is convinced she’ll be back in the saddle before long and harbors no ill will toward those honest brokers throughout Eagle Forum’s network who do genuinely support Cruz. “I’ve built the best and most respected and most unusual organization,” Schlafly said. “This is an organization of volunteers. A lot of these conservative organizations are based on money. They will have a smart guy at the top and a mailing list. We are an organization of volunteers. I am a volunteer —  I do not take a salary out of Eagle Forum. All my state leaders are volunteers. It’s a different ballgame to run an organization with people who are really all independent contractors that make their own decisions. Now, at one time, I don’t know how many months ago that was, there were a dozen of them who decided to sign a paper endorsing Cruz. And I said that’s alright if they want to endorse Cruz that’s okay. Free speech. ” But there’s no way she’s backing down from her own endorsement of Donald Trump, and she bristles at any suggestion that it was the product of a “manipulation” from Martin or anyone else. “I don’t think Ed [Martin] knew about my endorsement until he read it in the paper,” she said. “He had nothing to do with that. If you want to know why I endorsed Trump, read ‘A Choice Not An Echo.’ I’ve been fighting the kingmakers for, what is it, 40 years —  since 1940 or whatever —  Trump was the one willing to take on the kingmakers, and I didn’t see anyone else who was doing that. ” And what about the claims and allusions by some of her detractors that she’s no longer able to lead her own organization? “They’ve made all kinds of charges against me, but I think they’re just all wrong,” she said. “They’ve tried to say I’m not competent. That’s why I’m doing about two live interviews a day, which you have to be able to do that. I had my doctor write to some of them to deny the fact that I’m heavily medicated. I’m not at all. I’m taking the same three pills morning, noon and evening that I’ve been taking for about 20 years. ” So what really provoked this attempted coup? Was it the Trump endorsement? “I would say that it isn’t the whole story, but it is certainly part of it, and they are using that as an excuse,” Schlafly said when asked if this happened at least in part because of her endorsement of Trump. “It’s certainly part of it because a great many of my Eagles are for Cruz, and really the fight started when they distributed the list of Eagles who are supporting Cruz and acted like it was my list,” she continued. “It confused people, and I did not approve that, but I did not speak out against that. I have never spoken out against Cruz —  I’ve only said nice things about him. ” She believes the actions of the rogue board members are all about who controls of the influential organization she founded. “Part of it is some of them think they want to run Eagle Forum,” she said. “They want to take it over. It’s the best organization on the conservative side, and they’d like to control it. ” Schlafly said they are using her endorsement of Trump as a tool to do that. “Yes. Yes, I think the Trump fight is part of it,” Schlafly said when asked if the Trump endorsement was a “mechanism” by which her detractors have aimed to take control of Eagle Forum. “I think a great number of our members are for Trump. They tell me all the time. And a great many are for Cruz. And I have said we believe in free speech, and individually you can endorse anybody you want. But I did object when they pretended it was Eagle Forum doing it. ” Also, importantly, Schlafly specifically stated that she believes the Cruz campaign itself “could be” behind much of the actions against her internally at Eagle Forum. One reason she gives for that belief is an internal contact list that was leaked to the Cruz campaign. In an article in World Net Daily, Martin pinned the leaked list on an unnamed Eagle Forum member who was also working for the Cruz campaign and passed on the list to them. BNN: “Do you think that the Cruz campaign has had a hand in this as well? Do you think that part of this is retaliation —  I would argue that Trump won Missouri because of you and your endorsement. And there’s plenty of other places where you’ve made a demonstrable difference in this Republican presidential primary. I mean, do you think that part of this is retaliation by the Cruz campaign almost agitating them to do this?” SCHLAFLY: “Well, that could be. That could be. They tried to make it look like Eagle Forum was endorsing Cruz. But Eagle Forum has not taken a position like that. And somebody leaked part of my calling list to the Cruz campaign. I know that because they called some of my best people and asked them to work for Cruz. The only way they could have gotten that calling list is getting it leaked by somebody who is not loyal to me. ” It remains to be seen whether Schlafly and her daughter will patch up their relationship before it’s too late, but at the end of her interview with Breitbart News Cori made clear she had a message for her mom: “I love my mother very much. I think that says it all. ” Schlafly is frequently compared to Maggie Thatcher, another strong woman leader who led the world with President Ronald Reagan back in the 1980s, and now America’s Iron Lady is turning her guns squarely on a possible contested Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.  “The thing that I’m particularly interested in is the issue that we’ve been so concerned about: The [Republican] National Convention,” Schlafly told Breitbart News, changing the conversation away from the internal strife at Eagle Forum literally on the second question of a 20 minute interview back to what her heart is focused on. “You know all of you press people are now predicting that nobody will get the 51 percent, so we will have an open convention [for] first time I guess since I don’t know what —  1976? We want to be players. So I’ve encouraged our people to try to get elected as delegates, and we’ll meet you in Cleveland. We all want to go to Cleveland in the summer where it’s so hot and muggy. ” WATCH: PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY MAINTAINS SHE HAS CONTROL: </td>\n",

He has portrayed himself in cameo appearances in movies and on television, including ”Zoolander,” ”Sex and the City” and ”Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.” Trump’s slogan, ”Make America Great Again,” was first used by Ronald Reagan while he was running against President Jimmy Carter.  Timeline:1970s   After college, works with his father on apartment complexes in Queens and Brooklyn. 1973   Fred and Donald Trump are named in a Justice Department lawsuit alleging Trump property managers violated the Fair Housing Act by turning away potential   tenants.

The case is settled in 1975, and the Trumps agree to provide weekly lists of vacancies to black community organizations.   1976   Trump and his father partner with the Hyatt Corporation, purchasing the Commodore Hotel, an aging midtown Manhattan property.

January 2004   ”The Apprentice,” a reality show featuring aspiring entrepreneurs competing for Trump’s approval, premieres on NBC. November 21, 2004   Trump Hotels  Casino Resorts Inc. files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 2005   Establishes Trump University, which offers seminars in real estate investment.

June 16, 2015   Announces that he is running for president during a speech at Trump Tower.  June 28, 2015   Says he’s giving up the TV show ”The Apprentice” to run for president.  June 29, 2015   NBC says it is cutting its business ties to Trump and won’t air the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants because of ”derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants.” This comes two weeks after comments Trump made about Mexican immigrants during his presidential campaign announcement.  July 8, 2015   In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Trump says he ”can’t guarantee” all of the workers he employs have legal status in the United States. This is in response to questions about a Washington Post report about undocumented immigrants working at the Old Post Office Pavilion construction site in Washington, which Trump is converting into a luxury hotel.  July 15, 2015   Trump’s campaign reports the Republican presidential candidate’s net worth is ”in excess of ten billion dollars,” and his personal finance disclosure has been submitted to the Federal Election Commission.  July 22, 2015   Donald Trump’s financial disclosure report is made public by the Federal Election Commission. August 6, 2015   During the first 2016 Republican debate, Trump is questioned about a third party candidacy, his attitude towards women and his history of donating money to Democratic politicians. He tells moderator Megyn Kelly of Fox News he feels he is being mistreated. August 7, 2015   The controversy continues, as Trump tells CNN’s Don Lemon that Kelly was singling him out for attack, ”You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”  September 11, 2015   Trump announces on social media he has purchased NBC’s half of the Miss Universe Organization, which organizes the annual Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants.

September 13, 2016   During an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says his office is investigating Donald Trump’s charitable foundation ”to make sure it’s complying with the laws governing charities in New York.” October 1, 2016   The New York Times reports Trump declared a $916 million loss in 1995 which could have allowed him to legally skip paying federal income taxes for years. The report is based on a financial document mailed to the newspaper by an anonymous source. October 7, 2016   Unaired footage from 2005 surfaces of Trump talking about trying to have sex with a married woman and being able to grope women. In footage obtained by The Washington Post, Trump is heard   discussing women in vulgar terms during the taping of a segment for ”Access Hollywood.” In a taped response, Trump apologizes early Saturday, ”I said it, I was wrong and I apologize.” October 9, 2016   During the second presidential debate, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asks Trump about his descriptions of groping and kissing women without their consent in the ”Access Hollywood” footage. Trump denies that he has ever engaged in such behavior and declares the comments were ”locker room talk.” After the debate, 11 women step forward to claim that they were sexually harassed or sexually assaulted by the real estate developer. Trump says the stories aren’t true.      November 8, 2016   Is elected president of the United States. Trump will be the first US president who has never held elected office, a top government post or a military rank.  November 18, 2016   Trump agrees to pay $25 million to settle three lawsuits against Trump University. The deal will keep the   from having to testify in a trial in San Diego that was set to begin November 28. The settlement ends a suit brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, as well as two class action suits in California. About 6, 000 former students are covered by the settlement. The victims will receive at least half of their money back. December 24, 2016   Trump says he will dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation ”to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President.” A spokeswoman for the New York Attorney General’s Office says that the foundation cannot legally close until investigators conclude their probe of the charity.  January 20, 2017   Takes the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts during an inauguration ceremony at the Capitol, then delivers an inaugural address which focuses on the populist themes that fueled his outsider run for the presidency.  January 27, 2017   Trump signs an executive order halting all refugee arrivals for 120 days and banning travel to the United States from seven   countries for 90 days. Additionally, refugees from Syria are barred indefinitely from entering the US. The order is challenged in court.  February 3, 2017   A federal judge in Washington state blocks the ban nationwide.  February 9, 2017   A panel of three judges in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rules against the Trump administration, which sought to lift the block on the executive order.  February 28, 2017   Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.  March 4, 2017   Alleges on Twitter, without offering evidence, that his predecessor, Barack Obama, wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower ahead of the 2016 election. ”Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ’wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!”  March 6, 2017   Trump signs a new version of the executive order banning immigration from six   countries. Iraq is no longer on the list of banned countries and the provision blocking Syrian refugees indefinitely is removed. One day after the order is signed, Hawaii files a federal lawsuit challenging the ban.  March 15, 2017   A federal judge in Hawaii issues a restraining order which blocks the new travel ban and the suspension of the refugee program nationwide hours before it is scheduled to take effect. Calling it ”fundamentally flawed,” US District Court Judge Derrick Watson writes, ”It is undisputed, using the primary source upon which the Government itself relies, that these six countries have overwhelmingly Muslim populations that range from 90. 7% to 99. 8%.. .It would therefore be no paradigmatic leap to conclude that targeting these countries likewise targets Islam.” Two days after the ruling is issued, the Justice Department files a motion to narrow the scope of the Hawaii’s temporary restraining order, allowing the government to suspend the refugee program while other components of the ban are litigated.     March 16, 2017   A federal judge in Maryland issues a similar ruling. US District Judge Theodore D. Chuang blocks the travel ban, saying that it is unconstitutional. Also on March 16, the Trump administration releases its budget blueprint, with increases in funding for the military and cuts for agencies including the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture.   April 3, 2017   The White House announces that President Trump is donating his salary from his first months in office to the National Park Service. Spokesman Sean Spicer displays a check for $78, 333. 32 during a press briefing with Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke. May 19, 2017   Leaves for his first foreign trip as President, a     trip that includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican, a NATO summit in Brussels and a   summit in Sicily. </td>\n",

Love, Sticker Boy. pic. twitter.   —   Bob Lonsberry (@BobLonsberry) February 2, 2016,  11:47: Sanders gets ready to speak as his supporters start chanting “Bernie! Bernie!” and “Feel the Bern! Feel the Bern!” The Socialist thanks Iowa and says “nine months ago, we came to this beautiful state, we had no political organization. We had no money. We had  no name   and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America. ” Sanders says it looks like “we are in a virtual tie. ” He also says it looks like “we’ll have half of the Iowa delegates. ” He says he wants to congratulate Clinton to lukewarm applause. He says he wants to thank O’Malley to louder cheers and says O’Malley ran an   campaign and contributed a lot to the dialogue. He says as he thinks about what happened tonight, “the people of Iowa has sent a very profound message to the political establishment, the economic establishment, and, by the way, to the media establishment. ” The crowd goes wild. He says “and that is, given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. ” He says “what the American people have said” is “we can no longer continue to have a corrupt campaign finance system. ” He says he is the former Chairman of the Senate’s Veterans Committee and has had the privilege of meeting so many veterans. Sanders said they were protecting a democracy of one person, one vote and not of “billionaires buying elections. ” “I am overwhelmed and I am moved by the fact that millions of people throughout this country have helped volunteer for our campaign,” he says, pointing out that his campaign has received 3. 5 million contributions. He says the average contribution was $27. “We do not represent the interest of the billionaire class, Wall Street, and corporate America,” he says, “We don’t want their money. ” He says he is proud that he is the only candidate on the Democratic side without Super Pac and the reason he has done so well in Iowa and will do well in New Hampshire and the other states that follow is because Americans are saying “no to a rigged economy. ” “They no longer want to see an economy in which the average American works longer hours for lower wages while almost all new income and wealth is going to the top one percent,” he says. “What the American people understand is this country was based and is based on fairness  …     it is not fair when the top   of one percent today owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. ” He keeps railing against the rich and asks if his supporters are ready for a “radical idea. ” He says that “radical idea” is to create an economy that works for working Americans and not just billionaires. He rails against “starvation wages” and vows to wage the minimum wage to $  and get pay equity for women. [CNN and MSNBC are still showing Sanders’s speech. Fox News is not.] Sanders says he believes that health care “is a right and not a privilege” and touts his “Medicare for    program. ” And he declares he will pay for his programs by imposing a “tax on Wall Street speculation” and sounds gleeful when speaking about raising taxes on Wall Street to help the middle class. Sanders addresses his potential minority supporters by talking about criminal justice reform and then shifts to climate change, declaring that the “debate is over and climate change is real. ” He says Iowans have started a “political revolution. ” He says they will “transform this country” when “millions of people come together, including those who have given up on the political process,” and say “enough is enough!” [It seems like the only person who did not give a “victory speech” tonight was Trump] 11:42: CNN points out that Sanders supporters at his party booed when Clinton said she was a “progressive” who “got results” in her “victory” speech. Supporters also reportedly shouted “she’s a liar” as the campaign reportedly cut off MSNBC’s feed. 11:40: Breitbart’s Michelle Fields sends some photos from Cruz’s victory party:  (Photos: Michelle   News) 11:32: Clinton “breathing a big sigh of relief. ” Clinton sounds shrill compared to Cruz, who seemed in command. Clinton says Democrats have to be united against Republican who “want to drive us apart. ” She says she has followed the GOP campaign closely and understand what they are appealing to and vows to stand against it. She says Republicans want to “rip away the progress we have made” and says “we can’t afford that. ” Clinton says she is “breathing a big sigh of relief” tonight (truer words may never have been spoken) but she did not definitely declare victory though her aides have. 11:30:   switch to Clinton. Fox News sticks with Cruz. 11:2o: Cruz gets ready to deliver his victory speech. “God Bless the great state of Iowa,” he says. Cruz says he first wants to say, “to God be the Glory. ” “Tonight is a victory for the grassroots,” he continues. “Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation. ” He says Iowa has “sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next President of the United States will not be chosen by the media. Will not be chosen by the Washington establishment. Will not be chosen by the lobbyists. But will be chosen by the most incredible, powerful force where all sovereignty resides in the nation —  by We the People, the American people. ” He continues by saying that thanks the hard work of courageous conservatives across the state, he got the most votes every by a Republican primary winner in Iowa. He says tonight is a victory for millions of Americans who have “shouldered the burden of seven years of Washington deals run amok” and for Americans who have watched in dismay as career politicians in both parties “refused to listen and failed to keep their commitments to the people. ” Cruz says tonight is also a victory for those who think that “no one personality can right the wrongs done by Washington. ” He speaks up for the Constitution and says tonight is a victory for those who believe that our rights come from God and not from any party, including the Tea Party. He says the federal government’s role is to defend those fundamental rights. Cruz says Iowa has proclaimed to the world that “morning is coming” and says that from day one, “this campaign has been a movement for millions of Americans across this country” and “whatever Washington says, they cannot keep the people down. ” He says that when the Washington lobbyists settled on a candidate and the media said a conservative cannot win, courageous conservatives poured in contributions and said, “yes, we can. ” [Interesting: As Cruz fires up his audience, it seems like Clinton is trying to “bigfoot” him as she is getting ready to speak right in the middle of Cruz’s fiery speech. This is why it is important, as Cruz and Rubio did, to thank supporters later in the speech (Cruz started to thank a lot of his   operatives seconds after some channels switched to Clinton) and get the main message out in the beginning. Cruz effectively got his core message out to conservatives right in the beginning. Cruz needs a better background for these speeches. His effective “TrusTed” logo was way too big and television viewers could not see it.] 11:10: NBC’s Chuck Todd also points out there is nothing to back up the Clinton campaign’s confidence: There is nothing in our models that backs up the Clinton campaign confidence that they won. They still might. But it is thiCsLose,  —   Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) February 2, 2016,  11:08: Interesting prediction from Norm Ornstein: Prediction: if Hillary wins by 1 to 2% press will say it’s a wash. If Bernie wins by one vote, press will say it’s a revolution,  —   Norman Ornstein (@NormOrnstein) February 2, 2016,  11: 07: Decimal points matter for the   narrative for   and even   if Rubio continues to close the gap. Just ask Hillary Clinton after her narrow   2008 finish in Iowa behind John Edwards. 11:o5: Cruz tells the Associated Press that his Iowa victory is a victory for the conservative grassroots over the “Washington Cartel. ” 11: 01: Paul will remain in the race and head to New Hampshire. 10:55:   BuzzFeed jabs Rubio for his “ ” win: “OMG THANK U FOR THIS GOLD MEDAL”  —   marco rubio coming in third at the olympics,  —   Jessica Misener (@jessmisener) February 2, 2016,  10:50: Trump address his supporters and says, “I love you people. ” I says he “absolutely” loves the people of Iowa. He says that when he started this journey on June 16, he was told by everybody “do not go to Iowa” because you can’t even finish in the top ten. Trump says he decided, “let’s give it a shot. ” He says he is “honored” for his   finish and wants to congratulate Cruz and all the candidates, including Mike Huckabee, who Trump says has become a really great friend. Trump says “we’re just so happy with the way everything worked out. ” He thanks his family for being “so amazing” and “so supportive. ” Trump says that he is 28 points ahead in New Hampshire and “we’re leaving tonight” and “tomorrow afternoon, we’ll be in New Hampshire. ” He says he hopes to be “proclaiming victory” in New Hampshire. Trump says “we will go on to get the Republican nomination” and beat Hillary or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw up there. He vows to be back many more times and says he may even buy a farm. Trump’s speech could have been better. He should have had   speech prepared in case he finished second in any state but it seems like he did not. 10:35: A glowing Rubio addresses his supporters and says this is the moment “they said would never happen. ” He says for months people said they had no chance because he offered too much optimism in the face of anger. He says “they told me we had no chance because my hair wasn’t gray enough and my boots were too high” and his detractors said he needed to wait his turn in line. Rubio says Iowans sent a message: “After seven years of Barack Obama, we aren’t waiting any longer to take our country back. ” Rubio says “this is not a time for waiting” because “everything that makes this nation great hangs in the balance. ” Good use of time by Rubio by not using the precious time he has on national television to endlessly thank friends, family, and operatives. Rubio says that if Sanders or Clinton get elected, “we will be a great nation in decline. ” He says Obamacare “becomes permanent” if they win and Obama’s “unconstitutional executive orders” become permanent while America’s military declines and liberals control the Supreme Court. He says Clinton is “disqualified from being president of the United States” because “she thinks she’s above the law. ” He says Clinton can never be “  ” because “anyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their lives in the service to this country can never be the    of the United States. ” Rubio thanks Iowans because he has taken the first step to winning the GOP nomination and promises that when he is the nominee, “we are going to unify this party and we are going to unify the conservative movement” and “grow the conservative movement” by taking our message to people who are “struggling paycheck to paycheck” and bring them to our side. He also thanks “  and mighty God” and his family. He said he wants to congratulate Cruz for earning his victory and thanks Huckabee as well. He says his family’s story is the story of America and calls for a “new American century. ” Rubio rightfully seems ecstatic and his speech appeals to voters in South Carolina in addition to those in New Hampshire. He vows to be back in October and September of this year because “when I’m the nominee, we are going to win Iowa and we are going to win this election for this country. ” . @marcorubio: When I am GOP nominee, we are going to unify this party and the conservative movement. #IowaCaucus pic. twitter.   —   FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) February 2, 2016,  10: 32: From Breitbart’s Michelle Fields: Cruz crowd at victory party goes wild when CNN announces Cruz victory: (Photo: Michelle   News) 10: 30: Huckabee, who won the caucuses in 2008, will suspend his campaign, according to a CNN report. 10:28: From Breitbart’s Alex Swoyer: As CNN called the Iowa caucus for Ted Cruz, supporters at Donald Trump caucus party started booing. 10: 26: Cruz headquarters ecstatic.

If Trump resoundingly wins Iowa, it may be nearly impossible to stop him if he then wins New Hampshire. It would be a political earthquake. But I’m more interested to see what will happen if Trump loses an early state primary. Does he have the political sophistication to use a potential loss to set up victories down the road that Obama did after his New Hampshire loss in 2008. It was after he lost in New Hampshire that Obama delivered his “Yes, we can!” (which conveniently translates to “Si, Se Puede” in Spanish) speech that arguable helped him galvanize even more of his supporters in the following states to give Obama the nomination and the presidency. Can Trump pull off something familiar? That, to me, is the $1 billion question. As overhyped as Trump’s been at times, we may b underplaying the political earthquake a Trump victory cd set off tonight @NBCNightlyNews,  —   Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) February 1, 2016,  6:35: Secret Ballot Could Help Donald Trump: Unlike Democrats, Iowa Republicans cast secret ballots at their caucuses, and that may benefit Donald Trump, especially with    voters who may be reluctant to publicly declare their support for Trump. Trump’s campaign flyer explicitly informs potential caucus attendees that the “ballot is Secret,” with “Secret” written in bold, which is no accident. A Morning Consult analysis recently found that Trump polls considerably better in online polls than in live telephone interviews by about six percentage points and “his [hidden] advantage online is driven by adults with higher levels of education. ” “Among adults with a bachelors degree or postgraduate degree, Trump performs about 10 percentage points better online than via live telephone,” the study found.   voters who lack college degrees, which is the stereotype of typical Trump voters, are not hesitant to wear their support for Trump on their sleeves. But Trump gets support from a huge swath of the GOP electorate, even moderate Republicans and those with college degrees and higher incomes. If these voters had to publicly declare their support for Trump like Democrats have to at their caucuses, though, some may be reluctant to do so just like moderate women who support Sarah Palin and are often hesitant to reveal their support in pubic because it may not be “socially acceptable” to admit support for someone whom their peers like to bash in public. But the secret ballot ensures that some of Trump’s supporters will not risk social ostracism on Monday evening.  (Photo: Associated Press) 6:00: Here’s what’s at stake for Democrats and Republicans tonight per the Associated Press: DEMOCRATS HAVE 44 DELEGATES AT STAKE, Iowa Democrats award delegates proportionally, based on the statewide vote as well as the vote in individual congressional districts. Candidates must get at least 15 percent of the statewide vote to win any statewide delegates. They must win at least 15 percent of the vote in individual congressional districts to win the delegates allocated to those districts. The threshold could be a problem for former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is polling below 15 percent in   polls in Iowa. In a tight contest, it is possible for two candidates to split the delegates evenly. There are 4, 763 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, so it takes 2, 382 to win the nomination. ___, REPUBLICANS HAVE 30 DELEGATES AT STAKE, Republicans also award delegates proportionally, based on the statewide vote. But there is no threshold for winning them. That means a Republican candidate could win a single delegate with as little as 1. 67 percent of the vote, depending on how the rounding works out. There are 2, 472 delegates to the Republican National Convention, so it takes 1, 237 to win the nomination. 5:50: Here’s how Iowans voted in 2012 (per the Des Moines   Consult). According to demographics expert Dante Chinni, since Trump’s supporters include voters who lack college degrees in addition to those who are less religious, he will “find friendly territory in the state’s southern counties, such as Decatur, Lucas, Monroe and Lee. He may also do well in counties that run through the center of the state, such as Guthrie, Jasper and Adair. ” Chinni argues that “if those counties go for the New York businessman, it will be a signal that Mr. Trump’s core supporters stuck with him on Monday night. ” Chinni also adds that in 2012, Santorum won “34 of the 44 counties west of Polk,” and Cruz must run up big margins in this   territory big or “he won’t win the state. ” 5:3o: Former Rep. Mike Rogers ( ) said on CNN that he has been speaking to people on the ground in Iowa and they have “never had so many calls” from new voters asking about where they have to go to caucus. He said “if that continues and they actually show up, it’s going to be a Trump night. ” He added that Cruz has organized reliable conservative voters across the state and it will be hard for anybody to beat Cruz’s ground game. 3:50: A Morning Consult analysis determined that Rubio’s campaign has spent $4. 53 million on ads in Iowa while his Super PACs have added another $7. 2 million. How in the world, then, can a   finish be considered a huge win for Rubio, who, before he became the face of the Gang of Eight’s comprehensive amnesty bill, was the Iowa frontrunner. And what in the world was overrated GOP operative Mike Murphy, who has ZERO presidential wins and heads Jeb Bush’s Super PAC, doing spending $14 million in Iowa? Here are the numbers per Morning Consult: Jeb Bush: $0 from campaign, $14. 05m from Super PACsBen Carson: $3. 28m, $329kChris Christie: $44k, $543kTed Cruz: $2. 90m, $4. 53mCarly Fiorina: $356k, $475kMike Huckabee: $0, $2. 76mJohn Kasich: $0, $0Rand Paul: $86k, $1. 23mMarco Rubio: $4. 53m, $7. 20mRick Santorum: $3k, $29kDonald Trump: $3. 54m, $24k, Democrats: Hillary Clinton: $10. 74m from campaign, $48k from Super PACsBernie Sanders: $10. 01m, $0Martin O’Malley: $0, $239k, 3:15: Sarah Palin Blasts Steve King for False Attacks. Re: Trump, Palin says: When Both Political Parties ‘Hate You, You Know America Loves You.’ In introducing Trump at a Cedar Rapids event, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin said Trump is in the perfect position to “tell the Washington good old boys that the status quo is going to go. ” She said both political establishments are in “such a panic” because Trump will put them out of business. Palin added that when both political parties hate you, “you know America loves you. ” Palin said Trump’s campaign has exposed all of the cronyism in the permanent political class and asked what have Trump’s opponents ever built. She quipped that they have built big vocabularies, big debt and big war chests. Palin also blasted Rep. Steve King ( ) a top Cruz supporter, for attacking her on MSNBC earlier in the day and falsely accusing her of selling her support to Trump. Palin said the only promise Trump made to her was to “make America Great Again. ” She said King’s attack is “why people don’t really like politics,” which people rightfully think is a “dirty business” where people say things they know are untrue. “Why would a good conservative like Steve King want to say something he knows isn’t true?” Palin asked. “That doesn’t sound like the heartland of America. ” Palin said maybe King has forgotten his heart in in the heartland or has gotten “Potomac fever. ” She said maybe he has been huffing ethanol in the corn fields. She called King’s accusations “way off base” and she said she has learned from Trump that you have to stand up for what is right, for yourself, your family, your community, and your country. Palin has repeatedly emphasized that she decided to endorse Trump because he is the candidate least beholden to anybody in the permanent political class. She has said Cruz would be better served fighting the Republican establishment in the Senate. King’s comments on the day of the caucuses do Cruz no favors in a state where conservatives still hold Palin in high regard (ask Joni Ernst. Ask Santorum, who surged in 2011 right after Palin praised his campaign without even endorsing him). 2:40: Santorum Compares Himself to Nick Saban: Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, who won the 2012 Iowa caucuses, said he would “reassess” his campaign if he did not win tonight. Santorum said Trump’s success represents the frustration voters have with the Republican Party in D. C. that has “betrayed” them. Santorum said disaffected Americans think both parties do not represent their interests on trade and immigration, and he said Democrats want amnesty for votes while Republicans want it for cheaper labor. Santorum said mass immigration is keeping wages down and both parties are not looking out for  . Earlier, Santorum made an interesting argument against a potential Trump presidency. He said a struggling football team would not hire someone without any football knowledge as a head coach because that coach would then have to hire a bunch of assistant coaches who are football experts. Santorum told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell that Trump would have to hire “insiders” to run the government, and Santorum compared himself to Nick Saban. The analogy doesn’t quite work as well because Trump is succeeding because many voters see him as a great delegator, and they trust him to hire people with knowledge who will not be   by the system. 2:35 PM: Sanders, Trump   Candidates in Iowa per Facebook: Sanders: 42. 2%Trump: 21. 7%Clinton: 13. 1%Cruz: 10. 7%Paul: 4. 7%Carson: 2. 6%Rubio: 1. 9% 2:30 PM: Cruz completes “The Full Grassley” (visting all of Iowa’s 99 counties) with his stop in Jefferson, Iowa (Greene Country).

His supporters cut a deal with Bill Richardson’s supporters —  and the Clintons still not have forgiven the former New Mexico Governor and U. N. Ambassador for those shenanigans. Obama supporters also kept some candidates viable at certain caucus locations (ensuring they had 15% support in the room) if they thought their supporters would go to Hillary Clinton. Fast forward to 2016, and the Clinton campaign may be taking a page out of Obama’s playbook that defeated her. MSNBC pundits over the weekend suggested that Clinton supporters may keep former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley viable by supporting him at some caucus locations so his supporters do not go to Sanders. Clinton denied any knowledge of these reported plans. But it just goes to show that the caucuses can be much more chaotic for Democrats. Unlike Democrats, who require that 15% threshold, Republicans can cast their caucus vote through secret ballot, and GOP   can write the name of the candidate they support on a piece of scrap paper. Hopefully the   will be less chaotic than it was in some caucus locations in 2012. (Video courtesy of videographer Pat Frank). </td>\n",

He says this has to be a “shared national mission” to bring hope to every child.

And he says that too many in the inner cities have not been included in the American Dream. He says his goal as president will be to ensure that every child be placed on the ladder to success. He says the ladder rests on a fundamental foundation —  “we need safety. There’s such danger in our inner cities. ” Trump says every kid must be able to grow up in a safe community because “you can’t have prosperity without security. ” He is also blasting the   education bureaucracy that is protecting   bureaucrats. Trump says he wants every child in the inner cities to attend the school of their choice. Trump says it’s a matter of putting “students first” and not the “education bureaucracy. ” 2:32: Trump says Clinton believes in “globalism” and “not Americanism. ” He blasts Clinton for saying no American died in Libya and says the biggest difference in the race is Iraq —  Clinton supported it while he opposed it. Trump also points out that Clinton used her time in the State Department to give up much of the country’s uranium to Russia, do favors for UBS bank and give contracts to friends and family in Haiti. 2:30: Trump is slamming Clinton for endangering the country’s national security with her private server. He points out that the FBI discovered that foreign agents hacked into the accounts of those with whom she regularly communicated. Trump says this is why Clinton is “unfit” to become president. He also says Clinton failed to take responsibility for her Middle East policy that has unleashed radical Islam terrorists across the world. 2:20: Pence is asked what is the biggest misconception about Donald Trump.

They are honest, tough, and believe in the what has always made America strong, he says. Pence says Reagan’s bluntness ushered in a GOP landslide because “he meant it. And so does Donald Trump. ” He compares Reagan Democrats to “Trumpocrats. ” Pence says Trump has the “toughness to rebuild our economy and command the respect of the world. ” 1:48: Pence reminds the audience that Reagan wanted to be President in 1976 so he could meet with the Soviet leader and ask him what it would take for America to get along with the Soviets  …     and then whisper in his ear, “Nyet!” 1:47: Pence points out that the “smart set” dismissed Reagan as a “simpleton” and an “entertainer who entered politics late in life. ” He says union members and   Democrats leaned in and listened to Reagan’s eloquence and the common sense of the uncommonly talented man. He says Ronald Reagan spoke the truth to the American people just like Donald Trump has. [Trump is no Reagan, but the same types of people on both sides of the aisle who initially hated Reagan are the same types who dislike Trump.] 1:45: Pence says he always say Reagan as a “solutions conservative. ” He says Reagan’s principles still work when you put them into practice. Pence says “it’s exactly the kind of leadership Donald Trump is going to bring to Washington, D. C. when he is elected president. ” 1:42: Another campaign theme that would be much more productive than “I’m so flattered that Putin may have called me brilliant. ” My father has created REAL jobs.

Pence remembers telling his wife that Reagan was the reason he became a Republican. He shook Reagan’s hand and felt like he was talking to Mount Rushmore. Pence thanked Reagan for inspiring his generation to believe in his country again and Pence believes that Reagan blushed and said, “well, Mike, that’s a nice thing to say. ” 1:35: She seems to concede that the public perceives her as a “cold” and “unemotional” person who lacks empathy. ”I don’t view myself as cold or unemotional.” Hillary Clinton in @humansofny interview. https:  .   —   Amy Chozick (@amychozick) September 8, 2016,  1:30: Pence takes the stage at the Reagan Library: Honored to lay a wreath   my daughter Charlotte at the final resting place of our nation’s 40th president pic. twitter.   —   Mike Pence (@mike_pence) September 8, 2016,   Mike Pence and his daughter Charlotte pray at the Reagans’ burial site.

All Trump needed to say was that nice comments from foreign leaders will in no way influence any of his decisions. The less Trump speaks (like someone who is just winging it, Trump often seems like he has to fill up time when it may be best to just give short, succinct answers and not talk as much) the better it may be for him in the debates.

       "        <td>’’ ’ ’ ’’ ’’ ’Trump’s collaborators, like the   politicians who collaborated in segregation, internment, and McCarthyism, don’t want to face the full meaning of their complicity.’ ’But they must. All of them —  Priebus, Newt Gingrich, Gov. Chris Christie, and the long line of cowards and sycophants behind them —  must be held to account. They must explain to the public, under scrutiny from the press, why they’re willing to suspend the fundamental values of the United States.’ ’To facilitate this scrutiny, I’ve put together an indictment. It’s a summary of Trump’s record as a sectarian arsonist, a threat to the Constitution, and a war criminal in waiting. The indictment has 10 counts, each one specific to a transgression or a target group. These aren’t just character flaws. They’re insinuations, accusations, and threats that make Trump a menace to minorities and to the country as a whole. Here’s the list.’ ’1. Banning Muslims. Last fall, Trump issued a series of escalating statements against Muslims. He spoke of  through a database and .’ ’He claimed that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey had appeared on television  and he persisted in this libel despite his failure to produce evidence. Then, on Dec. 7, he called for a “. ”’ ’This was not an    remark. It was a written statement, which Trump read aloud at a rally. Critics pointed out that such a ban would be unconstitutional and   but Trump hasn’t withdrawn it. He views civil liberties and human rights as expendable.’ ’2. Sowing distrust of Christian minorities. Christie, Rudy Giuliani, and other Trump supporters dismiss the Muslim ban as an aberration. But it’s just one example of Trump’s ruthless use of fear. Ben Carson, for instance, is a member of the  a Christian denomination. Last October, after  showed him  in Iowa, Trump tried to scare evangelicals away from Carson.’ ’“Look, I don’t have to say it: I’m Presbyterian,” Trump . “I’m Presbyterian. Boy, that’s down the middle of the road, folks, in all fairness. I mean,   Adventist, I don’t know about. I just don’t know about. ” Afterward, Trump’s spokeswoman said “the remark speaks for itself. ”’ ’When Trump was  why he had brought up Carson’s faith, he : “I just said I don’t know about it. I said nothing about it.   …     I’d never say bad about any religion. ” But in the  of Trump’s attack, you can hear his insinuating tone and his deliberate choice of words. This was a cynical appeal to prejudice.’ ’Perhaps Sen. Orrin Hatch can explain to his constituents in Utah, many of whom belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, why he “” a candidate who would target a Christian minority in this way.’ ’3.   against Cuban Americans. By early December, Carson had faded. The new threat to Trump was Sen. Ted Cruz, who had passed Trump in Iowa polls.’ ’So Trump did to Cruz what he had done to Carson. At a  on Dec. 12, Trump tried to  between Cruz and conservative Christians: “I do like Ted Cruz, but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba, in all fairness. It’s true. Not a lot come out. But I like him nevertheless. ” Again, the  of Trump’s remarks shows his cynical intent.’ ’’ ’Perhaps Gov. Rick Scott of Florida can explain to his Cuban American constituents why he’s telling the GOP to “” the candidate who said these things.’ ’4. Stereotyping Latinos. When Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015, he said that some undocumented immigrants from Mexico were  but others were “. ”’ ’Then he sank into pure tribalism. Illegal immigrants, legal immigrants, unfriendly Latinos —  they were all suspect. On July 4, Trump  an allegation that Jeb Bush “. ”’ ’Trump didn’t bother to explain the logical inference that got him from Mrs. Bush, who immigrated legally from Mexico more than 40 years ago, to   “illegals. ” When Trump was asked whether he regretted the retweet, he said no. “I don’t regret anything,” he . “If my wife were from Mexico, I think I would have a soft spot for people from Mexico. ”’ ’Trump’s conflation of Latino ancestry with softness on “illegals” might have been forgiven as a   lapse. But then he repeated it. In February 2016, he  that he was still grappling with a lawsuit against Trump University “because there’s a hostility toward me by the judge —  tremendous hostility, beyond belief. I believe he happens to be Spanish —  which is fine. He’s Hispanic —  which is fine   …     but we have a judge who’s very hostile. ”’ ’The next day, Trump was asked . “The judge has been extremely hostile to me. I think it has to do with perhaps the fact that I’m very, very strong on the border,” said Trump. He offered no evidence of a connection between the lawsuit, the judge’s ethnicity, and the immigration debate. Instead, Trump simply repeated: “He is Hispanic, I believe. He is a very hostile judge to me. I said it loud and clear. ”’ ’Yes, loud and clear. Being Hispanic or Mexican American is, in Trump’s mind, sufficient grounds to accuse someone of judicial bias and softness on illegal immigration. Perhaps former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas can explain why he’s now praising Trump as a man who “” and pledging to “support him and help him and do what I can. ”’ ’5. Practicing group blame against blacks. The  attributed to Trump are    . But in what he’s written more recently, you can see resentment.’ ’In December 2011, he  about Kwanzaa, a   holiday: “What a convenient mistake:  issued a statement for Kwanza but failed to issue one for Christmas. ” (The charge was . )’ ’In November 2014, during riots in Ferguson, Missouri, Trump : “Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won’t see another black president for generations!” A few hours later, Trump  “President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community. ” And in April 2015, after the death of Freddie Gray, Trump  “Our great African American President hasn’t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore! ”’ ’It’s hard to believe that Trump’s ridicule of Kwanzaa, his explicitly racial use of “thugs” (you don’t need to guess that it’s code for black people —  Trump draws the connection for you) and his perpetual quest to  don’t reflect some underlying animus. Trump’s 2014 tweet also provides a rationale for voting against future black candidates. But even if you give Trump the benefit of the doubt on all these things, his comments convey an ugly assumption: that a black president, by virtue of his color, is responsible for the worst behavior of other black people.’ ’Perhaps Priebus or some other RNC official can explain why that assumption, which no Republican leader would apply to a white president with regard to the behavior of white people, isn’t flatly racist.’ ’6. Blaming sexual assault in the military on the integration of women. Trump has a record of cringeworthy quotes about women, ranging from the indirectly attributed (“  ” —  which Trump  he said) to the directly recorded (“,” “ ”). In April 2015, Trump’s Twitter account : “If Hillary Clinton can’t satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?” Trump’s spokesperson blamed the retweet on a staffer. But in August and again in January, Trump was at it again, retweeting several references to Megyn Kelly as a “. ”’ ’Sunday’s New York Times story, based on more than 50 interviews, suggests that Trump has trouble distinguishing . Even if you distrust these interviews and give Trump a pass for his crude language about some women, it’s hard to explain two tweets he posted on May 7, 2013. First he : “26, 000 unreported sexual assaults in the   238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men &amp; women together?” (The typo was his.) Nine minutes later, he : “The Generals and top military brass never wanted a mixer but were forced to do it by very dumb politicians who wanted to be politically C! ”’ ’Trump later tried to  but his meaning was clear: When you integrate men and women, even in the military, there will be sexual assaults. Therefore, integration is dumb.’ ’Perhaps Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, can explain to the women of America why he has  for the man who wrote these things.’ ’7. Advocating torture. Many Republicans defend waterboarding on the grounds that it isn’t really torture and that it could save lives by extracting timely intelligence. Trump . He told an audience in South Carolina that even if waterboarding were torture, it would be “,” and “we should go much stronger. ” In Ohio, he said that even if waterboarding didn’t extract useful information, he would approve it and even harsher measures, because “. ” That’s a policy of torture, without limits, as sheer retribution.’ ’Perhaps Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, who presents himself as a faithful Christian, can explain why he’s promising to “” for a man who preaches such cruelty.’ ’8. Targeting civilians. On Dec. 2, Trump announced a new target in the war on terror: “. ” In a   interview, he was asked whether that meant deliberately killing family members. “,” he said. “There has to be retribution. ” On Dec. 6, he explained that because terrorists “,” these families could be targeted as a deterrent against future attacks. On Dec. 15, he : “I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think, because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families’ lives. ” The next day, Bill O’Reilly asked Trump: “” Trump replied, “. ”’ ’That’s at least five occasions on which Trump declared noncombatants legitimate targets, based purely on their value as hostages, and refused to limit what he would do to them. Since then, he hasn’t backed off. At a debate in March, he was asked what he would do if the military refused his orders to target terrorists’ families. “They’re not going to refuse me,” Trump . “If I say, ‘Do it,’ they’re going to do it. ” In subsequent remarks, he said he would “” to make his orders .’ ’Perhaps former Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sen. Tom Cotton, or Jerry Falwell Jr. can explain why they’re backing a candidate whose proposed use of noncombatants is .’ ’9. Rationalizing plunder. Trump says his strategy against ISIS is to “. ” But as Jim Geraghty points out in National Review, Trump has preached oil confiscation  —  long before ISIS, in its present form, existed. Trump has said we should seize oil from  or any other   country we invade. It’s “not stealing,” Trump argues, since we’d just be “. ” The reimbursement starts with  killed in the target country, plus extra cash to “” in the war. The Geneva Conventions  but Trump doesn’t care. He  the ancient rule of conquest: “. ”’ ’Perhaps Dick Cheney, who defends the Iraq war as a matter of national security and humanitarianism, can explain why he’s  who frankly advocates taking that country’s wealth.’ ’10. Inciting violence. Trump has repeatedly encouraged violence at his rallies. On Nov. 22, he defended supporters who beat a protester at one of his events in Alabama. “,” Trump said of the protester. On Feb. 1, he : “If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. OK? Just knock the hell —  I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. ” On Feb. 22, when a demonstrator interrupted his speech in Las Vegas, Trump told the audience, “. ” Trump : “I love the old days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They’d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. ” On March 13, after a Trump supporter  a protester at a rally in North Carolina, Trump said he had “” paying the supporter’s legal fees.’ ’Perhaps Gov. Nikki Haley, who purports to represent a new GOP more interested in  can explain why she’s  behind Trump.’ ’There are lots of other reasons to vote against Trump. But these 10 counts are the core of the case against him.’ ’They’re not about ignorance, error, or policy details. They’re about his contempt for principles. Trump has demonstrated that there’s no ethnic, racial, or religious group he wouldn’t target for political advantage. He doesn’t hate Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans,   Adventists, or Muslims. They just happen to be the groups whose demonization, in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, seemed likely to help him. If targeting Jews or Baptists had served his interests, he would have demonized them.’ ’Trump has also demonstrated that there’s no line he won’t cross. He would promote vigilantism. He would bar people from this country based on religion —  or, presumably, based on race or ethnicity, if terrorism came from a racial or ethnic group. He would torture people just because “they deserve it. ” He would target the innocent to punish the guilty. He would subvert the Constitution and reduce the world’s greatest republic, through his mercenary foreign policy, to a medieval empire.’ ’When Trump sees black people rioting, he doesn’t look for an underlying injustice. He sees an opportunity to mock “our great African American President” for failing to “control” them. When Trump hears about sexual violence in the military, he doesn’t ask why so many men treat their female colleagues this way, or why they get away with it. He asks why women were allowed in.’ ’This is not a man who needs seasoning, pollsters, or     sessions on Capitol Hill. You can’t fix him with a TelePrompter, a super PAC, or a team of policy wonks. He’s not a project. He’s a menace. He’s unfit for the presidency of any country, let alone the world’s greatest military power. When the final indictment of Trump is written, the politicians who closed their eyes to his ruthlessness and kissed his ring will be recorded as  . To make America great again —  to keep America America —  they must be voted out.’ ’In the two weeks since the Republican National. ..’</td>\n",

Well, lo and behold, it took Anderson Cooper out of all people to say that though Trump may be short on specifics, Clinton has a tough time directly communicating to the American people.

He may be going on a bit too long here like Bill Clinton infamously did, because Joni Ernst an Ryan Zinke still need to speak and it is now 11 PM. Flynn says “Crooked Hillary needs to leave this race right now. ” He says we need to remember that our country was built on “  values and principles. ” 10:50: Flynn says Obama’s empty rhetoric has caused the world to have no respect for America’s word  …    ”nor does it fear our might. ” He says coddling and displays of empathy towards terrorists it “not a strategy for defeating these murderers like Obama and Clinton would like us to believe. ” He says releasing terrorists will not end the war and simply “emboldens the terrorists and prolongs the war. ” He says under Obama, “we have no coherent to protect our citizens and under Hillary Clinton it will be more of the same. ” He says we have become the “best enemies and the worst friends, and that has to change. ” 10:40: Lt. Gen Michael Flynn (Ret.) says, “wake up America. There is no substitute for exceptionalism. America should not fear our enemies. We should define them  . ” Flynn says that from this day forward, we must stand tougher together and to “never be satisfied with reckless rhetoric” from an “Obama clone like Hillary Clinton. ” He says our new American Century does not risk its future on political correctness and senseless hyperbole. ” There’s your headline for tomorrow, @nytimes: ”War is not about bathrooms.”  —   Lt.

She also says the election would not be a “Trump contest without the excitement and drama. ” She says her husband will only remain focused on one thing —  “this beautiful country that he loves so much. ” She says if she is honored to serve as First Lady, she will use the privilege to help people who need it the most, including helping children and women. She says you judge a society by how it treats its citizens and we must make sure that every child can live in comfort and security with the best possible education.

She says Trump is intensely loyal to his friend and family. She says Trump’s children are a testament to who Trump is as a man and father. She also says “Donald thinks big,” which is important for a president. “No room for small thinking. No room for small results. Donald gets things done. ” She says America is “underperforming and needs new leadership. ” She says Trump represents inclusion rather than division. She says Trump has worked with people of many faiths and backgrounds throughout his career and will represent all Americans and help make all Americans prosper. She says it’s time for him to use those gifts now for purposes far greater. 10:28: Melania Trump: Being U. S. Citizen was “greatest privilege on planet earth. ” She speaks of the sacrifices of our veterans have made for our freedoms. She recognizes Bob Dole, a great veteran who is sitting in Trump’s VIP box. 10:24: Melania thanks everyone for being so kind to “Donald and me and our young son Baron. ” She says they are excited to be with them at this historic convention. She says “I’m so proud of your choice for president of the United States —  my husband, Donald J. Trump. ” She says Trump is moved by this honor. She says she has been with Trump for 18 years and has been aware of his love of his country since then. She says she was born in Slovenia and her father instilled in her a love for business while her mother instilled in her a love of fashion and beauty. She says her parents taught and showed her morals in their daily life, which is something she passes along daily to her son. She says we need to pass those lessons along to many generations that follow. She says she became a U. S. citizen in 2006 and it was the “greatest privilege on planet earth. ” 10:23: Trump appears on stage to “We Are the Champions” and introduces the next First Lady, Melania.

It is “Islamic extremist terrorism. ” Rudy says “you know who you are  …     and we’re coming to get you. ” He blasts Obama for being the only person who couldn’t understand that Nadal Hassan committed terrorism at Fort Hood and not an “act of workplace violence. ” Rudy says Clinton and Obama lied bout the Benghazi attacks, including right to the faces of the parents of those killed. He says anyone who says “what difference does it make” re: how Americans are killed abroad should never be   . “Who would trust Hillary Clinton to protect them?” he asks. “I wouldn’t. Would you?” 10:22: Trump appears on stage to “We Are The Champions. ” 10:07: Giuliani says it’s time to make American “one again. One America. ” He says what happened to there is no white America or black America but just one America. “What happened to it?” he passionately asks. He says Trump is a man with a “big heart” because every time New York faced a tragedy, Trump was there to help and he did it anonymously. He says Trump is a man who loves all people —  from the top to the bottom from the middle to the side. He says he is “sick and tired of the defamation of Donald Trump by the media and by the Clinton campaign. I am sick and tired of it. This is a good man. And America should be sick and tired of their vicious, nasty campaign. ” 10:05: Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani says the vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe. He says they fear for their children, themselves, and for our police officers who are being targeted with a target on their back. He says we pray for the police officers in Baton Rouge and Dallas and their families and “we say thank you to the Cleveland Police Department for protecting us.

He says Trump will build the wall and Donald Trump will make America great again. 9:58: Sessions says Clinton has been the champion of “globalist trade agreements” but the facts are in and they have not worked. He slams the Obamatrade deal and says this must not happen. Sessions says elites have treated the concerns of Americans on immigration and trade with nothing but scorn. But he says there is no question that if we bring in more people, wages of Americans are impacted. He asks if it is too much to slow down and protect our national security and jobs. Sessions says Obama and Clinton just want to give amnesty for all Americans and it won’t work. He says Americans want help and “this election will make it happen. And that is why we need Donald Trump. ” [It’s great that Sessions gets a primetime speaking spot and gets to address the nation on issues of trade and immigration. He is speaking over the heads of the elite.] 9:56: SEN. JEFF SESSIONS ( ) gets a rousing ovation. He says speaking at the podium is a long ways from the rafters that he and his wife had as college students. He says GOP voters spoke clearly on trade and immigration and affirmed “Donald Trump and his positions” and “they opposed Obamatrade” while demanding a “lawful system of immigration that protects their safety and financial  . ” He says average Americans are the first to know that something is wrong with our economy. He mentions that the Washington establishment, the media, and big corporations have been in denial even as   and Hispanic families are hardest hit. He says we are on the wrong track and the American people know it. Yet, he says, Clinton’s plan is “more of the same. ” He says Clinton wants more taxes, more regulation, more immigration, more debt. 9:46: Rep. Tom Cotton ( ) says “help is on the way” for everyone who agrees that America should lead the way in the world. Cotton tells the story about how his father, a farm boy, gave up his comfortable job that was exempt from service and volunteered for the Army and became an infantryman who went to Vietnam in 1969. Cotton says 35 years later because of   he did the same. Agains the wishes of his family, he gave up his legal career and volunteered for the Army, became and infantryman, and went to Iraq and Afghanistan. He says his dad  joked that God was punishing him for what he did to his dad (his father joined the military despite the wishes of his dad, who had also served). Cotton says God had called them to serve and he says his family isn’t extraordinary but rather very ordinary because so many families can tell the same story across the country. Cotton says Americans want a    who calls the enemy by its name and draws red lines conscientiously but “enforces them ruthlessly. ” He says it would be  nice to have one who can also handled classified information. 9:45: GOP Colorado Senate candidate Darryl Green says it’s time for a tanned person to say “All Lives Matter. ” He also blasts Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. He also says we know Clinton loves her pantsuits but we should send her an email to tell her that “she deserves a bright orange jumpsuit. ” El Paso county commissioner Darryl Glenn says, ”Where’s Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton?   …     They don’t speak for me.   …     All lives matter. ’’  —   Christopher Keating (@chrispkeating) July 19, 2016,  9:40: Rep.

He slams the Occupy Movement and Black Lives Matter for “violating the code of conduct we rely on” and “transcending peaceful protest. ” He says, “I call it anarchy. ” Clarke says Trump is the “steadfast leader” that our nation needs. He says Trump has “consistently and constantly” raised his voice to defend the character of the American police officer and to note that everyone deserves to be treated fairly by law enforcement. He says Trump understand what can make our nation safe again is a “recommitment to a system of justice” where no elected official, even Hillary Clinton, or private citizen can claim privilege above the law. “It cannot happen in the United States,” he says. 9:25: Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke gets a rousing ovation.

He also spoke about the need for strong borders and says we need to cut through the “suffocating political correctness” and call “the threat what it really is. The enemy is radical Islam. ” McCaul says he is proud to serve as a member of Trump’s national security team and promises that Trump will “never apologize for America’s greatness. He will promote it. ” 9:10: Jamiel Shaw now speaking. He thanks his friend Trump, whom he calls the “undisputed GOP nominee” and the next president. He talks about how an illegal immigrant who just got out of jail killed his son soon after he called him to say he was coming home. He says it happened so fast that his son Jazz was still holding his phone. His mother, at the time, was serving overseas in the military. He says for two weeks, local politicians supported them. But two weeks after that, “everything changed” when “we learned the killer was an illegal immigrant” from Mexico. He was released from jail even though he had an assault and battery charge on a police officer. “You think Obama cared and Black Lives Mattered,” he says. “No. And we know Hillary is Obama’s third term. ” He says only Trump called him to see how he was doing and only Trump will end illegal immigrant and fight terrorists. He says Trump is a “gift from God” and asks attendees to support  . 9:06: Sabine Durden now speaking about how an illegal alien killed her only son. Her son was also in law enforcement as a    dispatcher. She says she has been talking about illegal immigration since 2012 and nobody listened until Donald Trump. She says Crooked Hillary always talks about what she will do for illegals and refugees while Donald Trump talks about what he will do for America. 9:04: Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of someone killed by an illegal immigrants, says her son was an integral part of her community. She says “this was a good cop story” that was “cut short” by an illegal immigrant who was high on meth and should never have even been in the country. She says her son’s life was stolen by an illegal immigrant and it’s time we have an administration that cares more about Americans than illegals. 9:01: Antonio Sabato, Jr. says his faith in Jesus Christ and country have compelled him to speak now. He says he is concerned about the country’s and his children’s future and “we need Donald Trump. ” He says Trump will get our country back on track. He says our rights have been trampled and security threatened by the failed policies of the last eight years. He says it’s clear from someone who was not even born here (he came from Italy in 1985 and followed all the rules and became a naturalized citizen in 1996). He says others who want to come and live and work in the United States should follow the same rules that he did. “We are a nation of laws for a reason,” he says. “There should be no shortcuts  …    ” He says Trump is for “unity” while Obama and Clinton “fuel divisions. ” He says having a secure border is not hateful —  it’s the responsibility of the government. 8:59: In a video, the mother and sister of Brian Terry, the slain Border Patrol Officer, say the best way to honor Terry is to honor America’s Border Patrol Officers.

Smith says Clinton looked her “square in the eye and told me a video was responsible. ” She says she has demanded from Hillary the real reason why her son was killed and asks, “how can she do this to me? How can she do this to any American family?” Smith says “Donald Trump is everything Hillary Clinton is not. He is blunt, direct, and strong. He speaks his mind and heart. ” She says Trump will not hesitate to “kill the terrorists who threaten American lives. ” 8:25: Patricia Smith, the other of Sean Smith, who was killed in Benghazi, now takes the stage. She tells the convention that her son was one of four brave Americans killed in Benghazi.

She blames Hillary Clinton for the Benghazi tragedy. “I blame Hillary Clinton,” she says. 8:22: Luttrell says America is the light in a dark world and it was his greatest honor to fight for her. 8:18: Luttrell says because he was willing to open up about his life and speak of his worst week, he was able to see all that America has to offer. He says the hell that veterans return from is not the hell they come home to. He says the only way “we’re going to keep America safe is to have an elite military  …     made up of the warriors and prepared by the toughest training we have to offer and supported by the best equipment and backed up by the nation. ” 8:15: Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry talks about how he got to know Marcus Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL and Purple Heart recipient who he says is like a second son. 8:12: Baio says everything we hold sacred is under attack and we need Trump to fix it even though he is not the Messiah. Baio says he’s just a man who wants to give back to his country. He says Clinton thinks she is owed the presidency while Trump is running from the “goodness of his heart” and “genuinely wants to help. ” He says it’s time to make “America America again. ” “Hillary Clinton wants to be president for Hillary Clinton,” he says. “Donald Trump wants to be president for all of us. ” 8:09: Scott Baio now speaking. He thanks all of the country’s veterans. Baio says being an American doesn’t mean “getting free stuff. ” He says “it means sacrificing. Winning. Losing. Failing. Succeeding. And sometimes doing the things you don’t want to do —  including the hard work —  to get where you want to be. ” 8:05: Robertson: Media missed Trump Train because they don’t hang out with regular Americans.

       "        <td>In the hills and hollows of Mingo County, W. Va. where unemployment is nearly triple the national average, it’s coal. On the southwest side of Chicago, where the landscape couldn’t be more different but the economic fears are much the same, it’s Oreo cookies. Elsewhere, it is cars, computers and  . And whether it is through rolling back regulations, imposing tariffs or making some    phone calls from the Oval Office to the   Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring back the vanishing jobs of miners, bakers and   workers, beginning on Day 1 of his administration. “It’s going to happen fast,” Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, recently told a cheering crowd in Charleston, W. Va. “This is so easy. ” If only that were true. For all of the appeal his message might have for residents there (Mr. Trump captured almost 90 percent of the vote in Mingo County) much of what he is promising to do  —   on his own, and through congressional legislation  —   couldn’t be accomplished in the first 1, 000 days of a Trump administration, much less the first 100. For example, Mr. Trump has suggested easing   regulations enacted by Democrats and Republicans alike that have hurt the coal industry. But King Coal is unlikely to ever recapture market share lost in recent years to natural gas made cheap by the fracking boom, not to mention   alternative energy sources like wind and solar. Nor could Mr. Trump, a billionaire businessman, force steel makers to buy coal from Appalachia to heat furnaces in Asia, Europe and North America that have been idled by weak demand. “I will not say he can’t do anything, but it’s very unlikely he’ll be able to restore coal to where it was,” said John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research. With production and employment in the mines down by about a third since 2008, Mr. Deskins said, “even in our most optimistic scenario, we don’t expect a big bounce back. ” Of course, a Trump presidency is far from certain. And any president’s sway over the national economy is debatable. But a big part of what has gotten Mr. Trump this far are his outsize promises. And while the case of coal and clean air illustrates the limits of a president’s power in the economic arena, there are other places where Mr. Trump would have considerably more room to maneuver. Like much of his speechifying, Mr. Trump’s economic and business agenda is a mixture of opening bids and   messages as well as some    proposals he might be able to put in effect as president, even without congressional approval. Sorting out what’s what, though, isn’t simple or safe. Just ask the pundits who wrote off Mr. Trump’s candidacy as a sideshow even as he won one primary after another. For his part, Mr. Trump warns it would be a mistake to underestimate his ability to change the rules of the game. “In my whole life, I’ve gotten things done,” he said in an interview on Saturday. “Whether it’s getting a city built on the West Side of Manhattan or getting zoning board approvals, my whole life has been finding a consensus. ” But when it comes to companies moving jobs out of the United States, he said a tougher tone was in order. “I’m not Obama, and there are stupid people in our government,” he said. “With me, there will be consequences if you move, and the consequences will be severe. ” In terms of coal and recovering all of those vanished jobs in West Virginia, Mr. Trump acknowledged that price competition from cheaper natural gas was fierce. “But coal is still less expensive, and it has a major place in terms of energy,” he said. And regulatory relief  —   whether in terms of environmental rules or workplace safety  —   would benefit the industry, he said. “I have become very well versed on coal,” Mr. Trump said. “The regulations are brutal, and they are sending inspectors into the mines two and three times a day. Even the miners say it’s out of control. ” In law firms, corporate boardrooms, lobbyist watering holes and think tanks in Washington and beyond, experts are quietly assessing what a Trump presidency might actually look like in practice. Or to put it more bluntly, business is business. So whether they find Mr. Trump politically abhorrent or a welcome antidote to the status quo, these insiders also want to know what he might mean for their bottom line. National debate: “Trump would put the bully in bully pulpit. ” Perhaps the greatest opportunity for Mr. Trump lies in the extraordinary ability of any president to direct the tone and contours of the national debate, especially on issues he has highlighted, like how American companies should treat their American workers. And unlike most past Republican candidates, Mr. Trump has not been reluctant to criticize big business on that topic. “Donald Trump would put the bully in bully pulpit,” said Seth Harris, who served as a top official in the Labor Department under Democratic presidents. Immigration: “Where the president’s power is least restricted. ” Consider immigration, one of Mr. Trump’s signature issues. He might well be able to deliver on one of his central campaign promises: handing out fewer green cards to foreign workers, or denying a place to   visa holders unless their American employers agree to pay them more. “There’s a reason why so many of Trump’s proposals revolve around the idea of denying visas to people,” said William A. Stock, a lawyer in Philadelphia who is the   of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “That’s where the president’s power is least restricted, if he asserts it. ” The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Mr. Stock said, gives the president “the ability to suspend the entry of foreign nationals whose entry is deemed to be detrimental to the interests of the U. S. ” Noting that recent administrations have invoked the law to forbid entry to individuals from the former Yugoslavia accused of human rights violations, as well as to Cuban and Iranian government officials, Mr. Stock said, “This is a tool that is pretty powerful, but it’s usually been used in more limited instances. ” Financial reform: “When it comes to regulation, people are policy. ” And what about “dismantling” the 2010   financial law, as Mr. Trump promised this month? Repealing the law might be difficult, but experts who helped draft the regulations agreed that Mr. Trump could defang them through selective enforcement  —   appointing different officials to the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission  —   and by issuing new executive orders. A President Trump would have wide latitude to name his own people to oversee less conspicuous but powerful agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and to seed Treasury and other government departments with   officials. “When it comes to regulation, people are policy,” said Aaron Klein, a top official at the Treasury Department from 2009 to 2012 and helped draft the   bill. “Regulators who don’t want to regulate can thwart the will of Congress. ” But the president’s reach isn’t unlimited. Nor is it speedy. And however stupendous Mr. Trump’s   skills may be, the forces of gridlock in the nation’s capital are no less awesome. “The system doesn’t change,” said Tom Korologos, a longtime Republican strategist and an adviser at the law firm DLA Piper in Washington. “Trump can say, ‘I’m going to repeal this or I’m going to repeal that,’ but it’s going to take longer than 100 days. ” Mr. Korologos, who served on the transition teams of President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush, isn’t supporting Mr. Trump this year. He added that while the presumptive Republican nominee’s promises might make “for nice talking points, it will be harder than he thinks. ” Tax cuts: A Republican Congress is unlikely to accept a $10 trillion deficit over 10 years. That’s especially true when it comes to the macroeconomic picture. Mr. Trump claims his proposal for sweeping tax cuts for individuals and businesses wouldn’t bust the budget and could lift the economy’s annual growth rate to 6 percent. More   experts say that’s magical thinking, a 2016 version of “voodoo economics,” as President George H. W. Bush famously described what came to be known as Reaganomics in the 1980s. They estimate Mr. Trump’s tax plan could create a $10 trillion shortfall at the Treasury over the next decade, and note that annual economic growth has topped 5 percent only once in the last 35 years. “I have a hard time believing that even a Republican Congress would enact his tax plan, because it would create enormous deficits,” said William G. Gale, an economist under the first President Bush who is now   of the Tax Policy Center in Washington. Mr. Trump responded that “those tax cuts go hand in hand with many other things. ” As a result of getting tough on trade policy and what he considers currency manipulation by China, Mr. Trump argues that more jobs would return to the United States, which in turn would spur economic growth and therefore tax revenues. Whether or not that’s realistic, any significant alteration in trade or tax policy means winning over the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, both of which zealously guard their turf. “This is what makes them tick,” Mr. Korologos said. “It’s going to take more than just a bunch of rhetoric to change things. ” Labor: An ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington. Like Mr. Korologos, Mr. Harris, the former Labor Department official, has seen the ebb and flow when administrations change hands in Washington. Except he was on the opposite side of the aisle, having served on the Democratic transition teams after President Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 and after President Obama’s victory in 2008. At Labor, where he was a top adviser under Mr. Clinton, and then as deputy secretary in the Obama administration, Mr. Harris saw firsthand just how much influence the president could have. Tasked with enforcing regulations on whether companies are abiding by minimum wage requirements, child labor restrictions, affirmative action guidelines, workplace safety rules and a web of other laws, Mr. Harris said, the Labor Department has never been very popular with big business or the Republican candidates it supports. And when George W. Bush succeeded Bill Clinton, the change was swift, Mr. Harris said. Budgets were cut, and travel to inspect factories and mines decreased. There was less emphasis on enforcement, going into workplaces and punishing violations, he said, and more on educating employers about potential infractions. After Mr. Harris returned to the Labor Department in 2009, budgets were increased, and surprise workplace inspections were resumed. “We investigated more deeply, enforced procedures, and were more likely to find violations,” he said. “There was no executive order or action by Congress or the White House. We just did it. The laws existed  —   it was a matter of whether you were going to solve the problem aggressively or be more passive. ” Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have long argued that regulatory zeal kills jobs and undermines economic growth. Democrats maintain it is necessary to protect employees from abuses and risks, while imposing checks on the power of big companies. Both arguments contain elements of truth. But Mr. Harris said that what was critical was that    civil servants quickly adapted to the message coming down from the Oval Office. “The president sets the tone for how our government is going to relate to our country,” said Mr. Harris, who is now a lawyer in private practice in Washington. “How the laws are implemented and enforced, how the money is spent and how motivated people are to do their job. ” Health care: “Selling insurance isn’t like selling credit cards. ”   isn’t the only big   law Mr. Trump has talked about repealing. The other prominent target of Mr. Trump’s ire  —   the Affordable Care Act  —   would be trickier to dispose of. Even if Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, simply repealing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, could bring on a political backlash from the 12. 7 million Americans who are directly covered under the law, not to mention millions more who benefit from provisions like those that allow young adults to be covered under their parents’ policy and those that prevent insurers from dropping coverage for   conditions. Moreover, Mr. Trump displays a lack of understanding of how health insurance works. For example, one specific change in the A. C. A. that Mr. Trump, along with other Republican candidates, has called for  —   allowing insurers to sell policies across state lines  —   is permitted under the law now. The problem, said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, is that insurers don’t want to do it because it’s not practical. “Selling insurance isn’t like selling credit cards,” Mr. Bagley said. “   health insurers don’t have networks of doctors and hospitals in place. The problem isn’t legal restraints, and it’s not a solution to what ails the health care economy. ” Mr. Trump responded that deregulation is still the answer, despite the skepticism of experts like Mr. Bagley. “The problem is rules, regulations and restrictions,” he said. “You’re going to have rate increases that are catastrophic, and the deductibles are so high people can’t even use the health care. If it was really open and you got competition going, amazing things will happen. ” Environment: Sending “a chill down the spine” of people who enforce the laws. Environmental regulation offers a more promising target for Mr. Trump, who has called the Environmental Protection Agency a laughingstock and a disgrace, and has promised to cut its budget. In fact, in the absence of congressional action, the Trump administration could target many other environmental regulations by simply going after the people who enforce them, said Don Barry, who spent two decades at the Interior Department and directed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under President Clinton. Decades later, Mr. Barry still recalls how a round of firings in the Interior Department at the dawn of the Reagan administration signaled a turnabout in policy. “The single biggest thing they can do is send a chill down the spine of career survivors in the bureaucracy and bring things to a halt,” he said. Similarly, a Trump administration might be willing to approve state environmental plans that are more friendly to fossil fuels, said Kevin Book, head of research at ClearView Energy Partners. Proposed, but not completed,   regulations aimed at restricting   mining for coal in West Virginia could be eased, he said. Trade: Trump can punish countries, but jobs are unlikely to return. Still, even if Mr. Trump were to win in November and roll back some environmental regulations, it wouldn’t significantly alter the fate of Mingo County and much of the nation’s depressed coal industry. “Taking a more lenient stance on   or   rules would do nothing to help coal demand,” Mr. Book said. “  power plants have been mothballed and are being disassembled, and that capacity is gone. It’s not even close to something you could reverse by administrative fiat. ” If Washington’s ability to gridlock even the most ambitious of presidential agendas were to block Mr. Trump’s White House plans, he would still have the bully pulpit, of course. And unlike Theodore Roosevelt, who coined that term, Mr. Trump probably wouldn’t speak softly. Still, that might not be enough to keep Oreos baking in Chicago. Nabisco’s bakery there isn’t shuttering completely as Mr. Trump has suggested, but some Oreo production will begin shifting to Salinas, Mexico  —   where Mondelez, Nabisco’s corporate parent, has invested $130 million to build new lines. Oreos will also continue to be produced at Nabisco bakeries in Virginia, New Jersey and Oregon. Announced in July 2015, the Nabisco layoffs in Chicago continued during the Illinois primary in March, despite jabs from Mr. Trump and both Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders. United Technologies is similarly unlikely to rethink Carrier’s move out of Indianapolis. And in an era when Apple is willing to fight the Obama administration’s efforts to unlock an iPhone on national security grounds, more corporate defiance may become the norm. Blanketing countries from China to Mexico with import duties would be a tall order without congressional approval. The White House, though, does retain plenty of leeway to punish countries it thinks are engaged in currency manipulation, dumping of products below the cost of production and other   abuses. The problem for Mr. Trump  —   or any president who wants to get tough on trade violators  —   is that, in the global economy, imposing tariffs on competitors abroad could have serious economic consequences at home by sharply raising prices on imported goods. Cheaper   televisions, computers, clothes, furniture and other products from Walmart, Amazon and elsewhere have been a rare bright spot for struggling   and   Americans. And trade wars cut both ways: Retaliatory tariffs on   products from countries like China would prompt howls of pain at still strong domestic manufacturers like Caterpillar and Boeing. But for all the uncertainty around what might happen after Jan. 20, 2017, the lawyers and lobbyists who are now trying to gauge a Trump presidency are already emerging as winners. Mr. Trump’s    unpredictability, Mr. Korologos said, is proving to be a boon for Washington’s legions of lobbyists. “Corporate America hates the unknown,” he said. “God only knows what the hell Trump is for. And corporate America is going to want someone to save them. ”</td>\n",

       "        <td>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   President Trump on Saturday accused former President Barack Obama of tapping his phones at Trump Tower the month before the election, leveling the explosive allegation without offering any evidence. Mr. Trump called his predecessor a “bad (or sick) guy” on Twitter as he fired off a series of messages claiming that Mr. Obama “had my ‘wires tapped. ’” He likened the supposed tapping to “ ” and “McCarthyism,” though he did not say where he had gotten his information. A spokesman for Mr. Obama said any suggestion that the former president had ordered such surveillance was “simply false. ” During the 2016 campaign, the federal authorities began an investigation into links between Trump associates and the Russian government, an issue that continues to dog Mr. Trump. His aides declined to clarify on Saturday whether the president’s allegations were based on briefings from intelligence or law enforcement officials  —   which could mean that Mr. Trump was revealing previously unknown details about the investigation  —   or on something else, like a news report. But a senior White House official said that Donald F. McGahn II, the president’s chief counsel, was working to secure access to what Mr. McGahn believed to be an order issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing some form of surveillance related to Mr. Trump and his associates. The official offered no evidence to support the notion that such an order exists. It would be a highly unusual breach of the Justice Department’s traditional independence on law enforcement matters for the White House to order it to turn over such an investigative document. Any request for information from a top White House official about a continuing investigation would be a stunning departure from protocols intended to insulate the F. B. I. from political pressure. It would be even more surprising for the White House to seek information about a case directly involving the president or his advisers, as does the case involving the Russia contacts. After the White House received heavy criticism for the suggestion that Mr. McGahn would breach Justice Department independence, a different administration official said that the earlier statements about his efforts had been overstated. The official said the counsel’s office was looking at whether there was any legal possibility of gleaning information without impeding or interfering with an investigation. The counsel’s office does not know whether an investigation exists, the official said. Last month, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, came under fire for asking a top F. B. I. official to publicly rebut news reports about contacts between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that the “White House counsel is reviewing what options, if any, are available to us. ” Mr. McGahn did not respond to a request for comment. He was traveling on Saturday to Florida to join the president at his estate,   . The president’s decision on Saturday to lend the power of his office to accusations against his predecessor of politically motivated wiretapping  —   without offering any proof  —   was remarkable, even for a leader who has repeatedly shown himself willing to make assertions that are false or based on dubious sources. It would have been difficult for federal agents, working within the law, to obtain a wiretap order to target Mr. Trump’s phone conversations. It would have meant that the Justice Department had gathered sufficient evidence to convince a federal judge that there was probable cause to believe Mr. Trump had committed a serious crime or was an agent of a foreign power, depending on whether it was a criminal investigation or a foreign intelligence one. Former officials pointed to longstanding laws and procedures intended to ensure that presidents cannot wiretap a rival for political purposes. “A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,” said Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for Mr. Obama. “As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U. S. citizen. ” Mr. Trump asserted just the opposite in a series of five Twitter messages beginning just minutes before sunrise in Florida, where the president is spending the weekend. In the first message, the president said he had “just found out” that “Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower” before the election. Mr. Trump’s reference to “wires tapped” raised the possibility that he was referring to some other type of electronic surveillance and was using the idea of phone tapping loosely. The president was adamant in conversations with several people throughout the day on Saturday that he believed he was right about the wiretaps, according to three people with direct knowledge of those conversations. Two people close to Mr. Trump said they believed he was referring to a Breitbart News article, which aides said had been passed around among his advisers. Mark Levin, a conservative radio host, had also embraced the theory recently in a push against what   commentators have been calling the “deep state. ” The Breitbart article, published on Friday, claimed that there was a series of “known steps taken by President Barack Obama’s administration in its last months to undermine Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and, later, his new administration. ” Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, once led Breitbart News. If Mr. Trump was motivated to take to Twitter after reading the Breitbart article or listening to Mr. Levin, he was using a presidential megaphone to spread dark theories of a broad conspiracy aimed at undermining his presidential ambitions, and later his presidency. Even with the Breitbart article circulating, several of Mr. Trump’s advisers were stunned by the president’s morning Twitter outburst. Those advisers said they were uncertain about what specifically Mr. Trump was referring to one surmised that he may also have been referring to a   news report about a secret surveillance warrant for communications at his New York offices. One senior law enforcement official from the Obama administration, who has direct knowledge of the F. B. I. investigation into Russia and of government wiretapping, said that it was “100 percent untrue” that the government had wiretapped Mr. Trump. The official, who asked for anonymity to discuss matters related to investigations and intelligence, said the White House owed the American people an explanation for the president’s allegations. Ben Rhodes, a former top national security aide to Mr. Obama, said in a Twitter message directed at Mr. Trump on Saturday that “no president can order a wiretap” and added, “Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you. ” The House and Senate Intelligence Committees are moving forward with their own investigations into Russia’s efforts to influence the election, and they have said they will examine links between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russians. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said on Friday that he believed there were “transcripts” that would help document those contacts, though he said he had not yet seen them. “There are transcripts that provide very helpful, very critical insights into whether or not Russian intelligence or senior Russian political leaders  —   including Vladimir Putin  —   were cooperating, were colluding, with the Trump campaign at the highest levels to influence the outcome of our election,” Mr. Coons told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC. “I believe they exist. ” In a written statement on Saturday, a spokesman for Mr. Coons said that the senator “did not imply that he is aware of transcripts indicating collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. ” The spokesman, Sean Coit, said Mr. Coons had “simply stated that a full review of all relevant transcripts and intelligence intercepts is necessary to determine if collusion took place. ” The New York Times reported in January that among the associates whose links to Russia are being scrutinized are Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman Carter Page, a businessman and foreign policy adviser to the campaign and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative who said he was in touch with WikiLeaks at one point before it released a trove of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, last August. Mr. Stone later said he had communicated with WikiLeaks through an intermediary. Mr. Trump appeared on Saturday to suggest that warrants had been issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. He claimed that the Obama administration had once been “turned down by court” in its supposed efforts to listen in on conversations by Mr. Trump and his associates. In the fall, the F. B. I. examined computer data showing an odd stream of activity between a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank, one of Russia’s biggest banks, whose owners have longstanding links to Mr. Putin. While some F. B. I. officials initially believed that the computer activity indicated an encrypted channel between Moscow and New York, the bureau ultimately moved away from that view. The activity remains unexplained. There is no confirmed evidence that the F. B. I. obtained a court warrant to wiretap the Trump Organization or was capturing communications directly from the Trump Organization. During the transition, the F. B. I.  —   which uses FISA warrants to eavesdrop on the communications of foreign leaders inside the United States  —   overheard conversations between the Russian ambassador to the United States and Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump had named national security adviser. Mr. Trump has pointedly and repeatedly questioned in conversations how it was that Mr. Flynn’s conversations were recorded, and wondered who could have issued a warrant. After The Washington Post reported that Mr. Flynn and the ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, had discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had just imposed on Russia, Mr. Flynn was pushed out of his post by the White House because he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of the calls. The Breitbart article cited mainstream news reports and concluded  —   going beyond the public record  —   that the Obama administration had “obtained authorization to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found then relaxed the N. S. A. rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government. ” Mr. Levin, a day earlier, railed about what he called a “much bigger scandal,” claiming  —   again with no proof  —   that Mr. Obama and his aides had used “the instrumentalities of the federal government, intelligence activity, to surveil members of the Trump campaign and put that information out in the public. ” Several senior members of Mr. Trump’s White House staff did not respond to an email requesting    responses to more than a   questions about Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts. Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, denounced the “willingness of the nation’s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them. ” Even some Republican lawmakers questioned Mr. Trump’s accusations. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska issued a statement demanding that the president reveal everything he knows about any wiretaps or warrants. “The president today made some very serious allegations, and the informed citizens that a republic requires deserve more information,” Mr. Sasse said, adding that “we are in the midst of a   crisis of public trust. ” Taping calls seems to hold a spot in Mr. Trump’s consciousness. He spent many years taping his own phone calls as a businessman. During the campaign, Mr. Trump’s staff members told reporters they feared that their offices were being bugged. But Mr. Trump’s latest allegations represented a sharp change in his tone toward Mr. Obama. The current president has frequently spoken about how much he admires Mr. Obama for the gracious way he handled the transition. But since taking office, Mr. Trump has frequently clashed with the intelligence agencies over the Russia inquiries, including efforts to examine the attempts by that country to influence the presidential election and the contacts between Mr. Trump’s aides and the Russian government. In recent days, the president has appeared increasingly angry about leaks of information that he believes are coming from law enforcement and intelligence officials who are holdovers or recently departed from Mr. Obama’s administration. People close to Mr. Trump have described him as determined to stop those people from sabotaging his administration. One adviser said on Friday that the president had been discussing a possible plan to try to prevent leaks from occurring. The adviser declined to elaborate on what the plan might entail. Two senior administration officials said Mr. Trump had tried for two days to find a way to be on an offensive footing against the news articles resulting from leaks one person close to Mr. Trump said his explosive claim was a result of that. Mr. Trump’s mood was said to be volatile even before he departed for his weekend in Florida, with an episode in which he vented at his staff. The president’s ire was trained in particular on Mr. McGahn, his White House counsel, according to two people briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump was said to be frustrated about the decision by Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, to recuse himself from participating in any investigations of connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Trump has said there were no such connections. Mr. Trump, who did not learn that Mr. Sessions was recusing himself until after the decision was made, told aides that it gave an opening to his critics on the Russia issue.</td>\n",

Trump, who has a commanding   lead among military voters, won the coin toss and elected to go second.  Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. All times eastern.  —   11:00: Trump campaign pushing that Clinton was on the defensive the whole night. Mainstream media journalists like Todd agreed that she was but also slammed Trump for his lack of substance. 10:55: Trump’s performance at the    forum has New York mag writer Jonathan Chait thinking that Trump could actually win the election. He, of course, blames Lauer for not questioning Trump tough enough. 10:15: And Russian state news is already highlighting Trump’s comments about Putin’s leadership  https:  .   —   Boris Zilberman (@rolltidebmz) September 8, 2016,  10:00: Mainstream media reporters ripping Lauer for not challenging Trump on Iraq. They apparently are not outraged that Lauer did not challenge Clinton on some of her whoppers on “classified” information and Libya. People not happy w Matt lauer letting trump slide on Iraq pic. twitter.   —   Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) September 8, 2016,  9:45: Clinton responds to Priebus: Actually, that’s just what taking the office of President seriously looks like. https:  .   —   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 8, 2016,  9:32: Priebus: Hillary “angry” and “defensive” because “she was caught wrongly sending our secrets. ” @HillaryClinton was angry + defensive the entire time  —   no smile and uncomfortable  —   upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets.  —   Reince Priebus (@Reince) September 8, 2016,  9:17: Seems very petty that Clinton’s rapid response team is criticizing Trump for saying that 22 veterans commit suicide a day as opposed to 20. Trump pointed to the higher number to highlight the seriousness of the issue. 9:08: On MSNBC, a corporal says he was satisfied with Trump’s answers. But he says he wishes that both candidates would have addressed the homelessness among veterans. He points out that we send billions to Iran and send millions on Syrian refugees, and some of that money could be better spent on ending homelessness among veterans. 8:55: Trump says he Clinton has a “happy trigger” and there will be “no greater burden” than possibly sending American troops into war. Trump says we have to make America great again but we have to make America “strong again. ” 8:52: Lauer says nobody would have expected Trump to take “deep dives” into these issues. He asks what types of things Trump is reading and what kind of homework he is doing now. Trump says he has “a lot of hats right now”and he is “studying” and meeting constantly with generals and other experts. He says he has learned but has a lot of common sense to deal with these issues. Trump insists he will be prepared to handle these issues and cites Clinton’s mistake on Libya. “She made a terrible mistake on Libya,” Trump says. Trump says he has “great management talent” and points out that he has found these subjects to be of “tremendous interest” all throughout his life. 8:50: Trump is asked what he would do to support all victims of sexual assault in the military. Trump says it is a “massive problem” and the “numbers are staggering. ” He says “we have to come down very, very hard on that” and wants to keep the court system within the military. He says right now, the court system “practically doesn’t exist. ” Lauer conveniently has opposition    question with Trump’s Tweet from years ago. 8:49: Trump is asked what he will do to stop 20 veterans from killing themselves daily. Trump points out that it is 22 veterans a day, showing some substance. He says he will create a great “mental health division” and the VA is a “corrupt enterprise. ” Trump points out that the VA can’t even fire the people who were caught stealing in Arizona. 8:45: Trump is now asked about his remarks about Putin [Trump must be careful not to let his insecurity and his desire for affection from anyone show here]. Lauer asks if he wants to be complimented by a former KGB officer. Trump says he will “take it” if Putin calls him brilliant. Trump says the fact that Putin calls him “brilliant” will have “zero impact” on him. Trump says “if he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him. ” He says Putin has been a better leader than Obama. He cites Putin’s high approval rating. Trump on Putin: ”If he says great things about me I’m going to say great things about him.” Seconds earlier said complements had no impact.  —   Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) September 8, 2016,  8:42: Questioner asks Trump if an “undocumented person” who serves in the military will be allowed to stay. Trump says the military is a “very special” thing and it would be a “special circumstance. ” [Trump needed to prepared to answer this question better. Should be a   call to him and his team for the debates. It isn’t rocket science to figure out the types of questions that will be asked in these settings.] 8:38: Lauer presses Trump on his plans —  or lack thereof. Trump says he has a “significant chance” of winning and doesn’t want to broadcast to the world his plan for defeating ISIS. He says Obama telegraphs when we are going to leave Iraq and he won’t make the same mistake. 8:36: Questioner, a Democrat, asks Trump what is next if we defeat ISIS so another group doesn’t spring up. Trump points out that Iraq was “somewhat stable” before Obama took over and led to the formation of ISIS. Trump says Iran will be taking over Iraq now and he says that he has always said that we shouldn’t be there but we should have taken the oil. Trump says ISIS would not have come into power if we had taken the oil. 8:35: Lauer asks Trump whether he knows more about ISIS than the generals. He says the generals “have been reduced to rubble” under Clinton and Obama. Trump says he has great faith in the military but he has not faith in Hillary Clinton and the current leadership. Trump points out that Clinton has been in the system for 30 years and “we need change. ” 8:33: Lauer asks whether a    should keep saying stuff that he later regrets. Lauer says Trump could spark conflicts, destabilize regions, and put American lives at risk and asks if Americans can afford to take that risk with Trump. 8:32: Lauer asks Trump what he has experience in his personal or professional life that has prepared him to be   . He cites his experience building companies and dealing with nations that are ripping America off. He talks about Russian planes and Iranian boats taunting the U. S. Trump says he has a history of good judgment and says that was against the Iraq War despite Clinton’s claims. Trump says the Iraq War was a “disaster” and how Obama pulled out of Iraq was also a disaster. 8:30: Trump now on stage with Lauer. He gets a warm applause that Clinton did not receive. 8:25: Clinton says she will do everything in her power to make sure people will be safer in Boston and San Bernardino after her presidency. She talks about taking on ISIS in the “arena of ideas” and engage them in the air, on the ground, and in cyberspace. She now uses the opportunity to push gun control by saying people on the terrorist watch list should not be able to buy guns without going over what happens if someone is mistakenly put on that list. She uses the time to attack Trump on her Muslim ban. Lauer never reminds voters that she vowed not to attack Trump at the beginning of the forum.   8:23: Questioner asks Clinton how she will determine whether American troops should be sent into combat missions. She says we will not put ground troops into Iraq and Syria and will defeat ISIS without ground troops in the region. She says there were 200, 000 troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan when she was Secretary of State and is glad we have brought “most of those” home. 8:21: When asked about the high rates of suicide among veterans, Clinton says she has put forth a “robust agenda” to prevent veterans from committing suicide. 8:19: An undecided Sergeant asks Clinton about the VA scandal her comments that it was not “widespread. ” Clinton uses the opportunity to say that she will not let the VA become privatized. She says that will be “disastrous for our military veterans. ” She says she will have a meeting every week in the Oval Office re: VA issues. 8:17: Lauer asks Clinton what would happen if Iran cheats on the nuclear deal. Clinton says she wants to put it into context because it is one of the most important strategic questions we face. She claims Iran was on a “fast track” to get nuclear weapons when she became Secretary of State. She gets testy when Lauer tries to get her off of her talking points and claims the Iran deal put a “lid” on the nuclear program. Clinton says Iran is not playing us on the nuclear deal in response to Lauer’s question. 8:15: Clinton claims she views force as a “last resort” when a progressive questioner asks her about her “hawkish” foreign policy. Also keeps claiming we didn’t lose a single American life in Libya. Clinton defended her support for 2011 Libya intervention. Most people have no idea what happened in Libya. So she can   it.  —   Marshall Cohen (@Marshall_Cohen) September 8, 2016,  #Hillary backs away from Libya very quickly but here’s how   she was #NBCNewsForum: pic. twitter.   —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) September 8, 2016,  Clinton again says “we did not lose a single American” in Libya intervention. Not sure why she keeps saying this.  —   Blake Hounshell (@blakehounshell) September 8, 2016,  Really?  @HillaryClinton said we ”didn’t lose a single American in Libya”. She does know #Benghazi is in Libya right? #NBCNewsForum,  —   Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 8, 2016,    8:11: Clinton now asked about her Iraq vote. She says the decision to go to war in Iraq was a “mistake. ” She says she also believes that it is “imperative that we learn from the mistakes” like   reports are supposed to do. She says we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again and claims she is in the best position to do that. Clinton claims Trump was for the war in Iraq after promising Lauer she wouldn’t use the time to attack Trump. She says Trump refuses to take responsibility for his support. [Lauer doesn’t call Clinton out. Will he call Trump out if he uses some of his time to attack Clinton?] [Clinton sounds like a bureaucrat instead of a leader.] 8:09: Questioner asks how he could have confidence in her when she compromised national security. Clinton robotically tries to explain that “classified material is designated” and marked so that “there is no dispute at all” that what is being communicated is classified. She says “what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people” in out government to send information with no markings. She claims she communicated about classified materials on a separate system. She also says she went into tents on foreign travel to view classified information and took it “very seriously. ” She claims she did exactly what she should have done re: handling classified information. 8:08: Clinton claims there is no evidence that hostile actors hacked into her email account despite FBI Director Comey’s insistence that her private email server was vulnerable to hacking. 8:05: Lauer asks Clinton about her email scandal. He asks her why her email scandal is not “disqualifying. ” Clinton robotically repeats that it was a “mistake” to have a personal account. She says the real question is the handling of classified material. She says she has a lot of experience dealing with classified materials. She says classified materials have headers that say “secret” or “top secret” or “confidential. ” She claims that “none of the emails sent or received by me” had such a header. But she admits there were emails involving America’s “covert drone program. ” [Clinton not even winning over her friends in the mainstream press.] Clinton on private server: “I make no excuses for it”    except she DID make excuses,  —   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 8, 2016,  Oh, no, back to ”headers.” It’s like Gore’s ”no controlling legal authority.” Too much parsing.  —   Roger Simon (@politicoroger) September 8, 2016,      8:00: Hillary Clinton on stage with Lauer as the forum kicks off. Lauer asks Clinton not to use the forum to attack Trump and says he’ll ask Trump to do the same. When asked what is the most important characteristic a    can possess, Clinton answers “steadiness. ” She says a    must listen and be able to sort out the different options being presented. Clinton keeps talking about “judgment” and “temperament. ” 7:30: Chelsea Clinton accuses Trump of making “misogynistic” remarks about her mom. 7:11: On MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell again cheerleads for Clinton, claiming that she has proven that she could answer the 3 AM phone call despite the Benghazi debacle. 7:05: Mainstream media pundits who spent a year lowering the bar for Trump are now complaining that Trump has a lower bar to jump over tonight than Clinton. 7:00: Some   reading. Joel Pollak on the five things Lauer probably will not ask Clinton. 6:55: Even the nasty   Esquire columnist Charles Pierce is worried that, “Politically, I think it is entirely possible that the event may be a net plus for Donald Trump. ” 6:45: Trump (he has plenty of stamina to be at a campaign event before his first showdown with Clinton): Hillary not a “real” New Yorker: ”Hillary, she’s not a New Yorker,” Trump tells NY Conservative Party. ”I’m a real New Yorker.”  —   Candace Smith (@CandaceSmith_) September 7, 2016,  Trump’s full quote when he said Clinton’s not a New Yorker: pic. twitter.   —   Ashley Killough (@KilloughCNN) September 7, 2016,    6:40: Very interesting. The New York Times asks readers, “Have You Done Something to Support or Oppose Trump’s Brands? ”: Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign has elicited strong emotions. We want to know how those reactions have influenced people’s behavior toward his products, which range from Trump books and clothing to hotels, golf courses and apartments. Then there are the products sold under the names of his children, like Ivanka Trump clothing and jewelry. Have you registered your disapproval or approval for his candidacy by, say, discarding or returning   clothes  —   or by booking a night at a Trump hotel? If so, we’d like to hear from you. A Times journalist may follow up with you to learn more about your story. Your contact information will not be published. 6:35: Romney trying to remain relevant. But including Gary Johnson in the debates may actually help Trump: I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall.  —   Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 7, 2016,  6:30: Look for Clinton allies to paint Trump as a “schoolyard bully” and a “hothead” as they have already telegraphed their attacks. 6:25: “   Forum” will be held aboard the Intrepid: Aboard the Intrepid  —   hours before tonight’s   forum with Clinton and Trump pic. twitter.   —   Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) September 7, 2016, </td>\n",

       "        <td>Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus calls Donald Trump the “presumptive nominee. ” Trump deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner is heading to Cleveland to scope out the situation for his boss. Indeed, most Republicans  —   with the conspicuous exception of House Speaker Paul Ryan  —   are lining up behind Trump. [Of course, Trump still faces a daunting challenge. His   #NeverTrump detractors have spent $43 million in the last three months to tear him down, and that’s a big reason why he’s 13 points down against Hillary Clinton in the latest CNN poll. And Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia  —   probably a liberal in his heart of hearts, but still,   enough  —   has released an electoral college map showing Trump losing, 347 to 191. To put those numbers in perspective, Sabato’s projection would put Trump in 2016 somewhere between the totals of John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012  —   both losers.  Meanwhile, the media are lying in wait to hurt Trump further. The Washington Post, which has published an endless string of   editorials, as well as     offered some “news” in a May 5 headline: “This brutal new ad shows the shredding machine that awaits Trump. ” As Stuart Stevens, a #NeverTrump Republican, has said with a cackle, a “   buzzsaw” is coming after the real estate mogul. Of course, all is not lost. As Trump likes to say, “Anybody who hits me, we’re going to hit them 10 times harder,” and who should doubt that he means it. Sixteen Republican rivals have already found out what it’s like to be hit by the Trump Truck. Moreover, polls and projections can change. We might recall that in 1988, Republican presidential candidate George H. W. Bush was down 17 points against Democrat Michael Dukakis in May, and down by the same   margin again in August  —   and yet, of course, Bush went on to win by almost eight points. And Bush’s landslide victory  —   he won 40 states  —   came despite the   millstone of Dan Quayle, his vice presidential pick. So now let’s talk about Trump’s vice presidential pick. It is, probably, the most important decision that Trump will make between now and the election it is not only the choice that will affect the outcome of the race, it is also the choice that will reveal much about Trump the man. As Newt Gingrich said admiringly, Trump may be “the Steve Jobs of modern politics”  —   that is, the singular genius who remade his world. But even Jobs, brilliant as he was, had a great team around him, led by chief designer Jony Ive. So yes, Trump needs a team. And on the subject of the vice presidency, Trump has had quite a lot to say in recent days. He told Robert Costa of the Washington Post  —   a token   reporter at that paper  —   that his choice would be based on two factors. First, “The number one qualification always is, ‘Would they be a good president? ’” And second: Having a working relationship with the person is going to be very important. You have to have good chemistry. In all fairness, when Obama chose Biden, it was an odd choice and yet they have very good chemistry together and therefore it was a good choice for them. So having good chemistry is very important. Looking ahead to the actual mechanics of his White House operation, Trump told Breitbart News’s Matthew Boyle that, as president, he would most need help dealing with Congress: I need a political person. Somebody that can deal with the Hill, that can deal with Congress and get things done, get things passed. Elaborating on that theme, Trump told the New York Times: As president, I’ll be working from the first day with my vice president and staff to make clear that America will be changing in major ways for the better   …     I want a vice president who will help me have a major impact quickly on Capitol Hill. One name that has come up repeatedly is Ohio Gov. John Kasich. As Trump said on CNN on Wednesday: I’d be very interested in vetting John. I like John, I’ve had a good relationship with John, I’ve gotten along with him well. Yet interestingly, Kasich has strongly denied any interest in the position. In February, he seemed to go out of his way to take himself out of consideration, declaring that he “would be the worst vice president anybody could ever imagine. ”  Continuing, Kasich said: I’d be worse than Biden. Because I’m my own man. I’m not going to take orders from these people. It’s not what I do.  It’s not who I am. Indeed, others, too, have announced that they wish to take themselves out of consideration, including South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, and Florida Gov. Rick Scott. But of course, in politics, one never says never  —   or at least one never, or almost never, means it. It’s likely that, in a crunch, most or all of the above names could be persuaded. But of course, maybe Trump isn’t interested in begging  —   maybe he’s better off searching among those who wish to be searched. Indeed, Trump has set up a VP search committee, led by Dr. Ben Carson  —   he’s another of those who has asked to be removed from consideration. So let’s consider some of the names that Trump might consider. In the interests of fairness, let’s identify a top ten and go in alphabetical order: 1) Ben Carson  Yes, Carson has taken himself out. And yes, he has agreed to lead the vice presidential search committee, but as we saw in 2000, the lead searcher can come up with, uh, interesting search results. Back then, Dick Cheney was leading George W. Bush’s   committee, and then miraculously, Cheney ended up as the “best” candidate for Bush. It’s possible that the same thing could happen again this year, but highly unlikely, for three reasons: First, Carson is an honorable man. Second, Trump is smarter than Bush, and therefore not likely to be gulled by a staffer. And third, for all his talents, Carson is not a Capitol Hill wheel  —   he flunks Trump’s core test. 2) Gov. Chris Christie, As a state legislator and a governor, Christie certainly seems to possess all the   skills one could want in a VP. And in the shorter term, to the extent that Trump sees his running mate as an “attack dog” against the Democrats, well, Christie is more than qualified  —   ask Marco Rubio. Another consideration for a VP pick is more prosaic: Can he carry his home state? New Jersey has been blue, of course, since 1992. Yet Christie has carried it twice, the second time, in a landslide. And Trump himself has his chops when it comes to winning in the Northeast. So yeah, a   ticket could put the Garden State, and its 14 electoral votes, in play, bigtime. Interestingly, we are now seeing an early test of Christie’s politico mojo. After Paul Ryan’s declaration that he was “not yet” ready to endorse Trump, Christie immediately announced that he would be reaching out to Ryan. So we’ll have to see how that goes. But if Christie brings home the bacon, in terms of bringing Ryan around, well, that would be a highly visible political feat. 3) Sen. Ted Cruz, Lyin’ Ted?  Really? Stranger things have happened. And yes, on Wednesday night, Trump told Bill O’Reilly that it was conceivable that he could pick Cruz. Okay, but still: In the annals of strangeness, Trump picking Cruz would be up there. (And for what it’s worth, Virgil thinks that Cruz is anything but a liar the real rap on the Texan is that he is candid, and then some.) 4) Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, The Georgian would seem to meet all of Trump’s tests: He is qualified to be president, he knows the Hill, he knows politics. Indeed, Gingrich ranks as one of the smartest and most original thinkers in American life today. And while he is regarded, by some, as too “hot” to be president, well, Trump is “hot,” too. The “cool” politicians have gotten us into the mess we’re in, and the voters want a change. Like Trump, Gingrich equals change. Moreover, Gingrich has long been allied with Trump, and when the full story of the 2016 campaign comes out, his positive influence on the Trump campaign will likely prove to have been extensive. Some will point out that Gingrich is 72, which would potentially make him the oldest vice president ever. On the other hand, Gingrich is highly visible, and highly articulate, on TV just about every day he doesn’t seem to be faltering at all, not in the least. 5) Former Gov. Mike Huckabee  After his own candidacy fizzled in February, Huckabee emerged as a staunch Trump defender on cable news. And of course, long before, Huckabee had his own considerable strengths: He was the highly regarded governor of Arkansas for more than a decade, and, as early as his 2008 presidential campaign, he identified the   blues affecting much of the country  —   and this at a time when most Republicans were   don’      drinkers. Huckabee, a veteran preacher and broadcaster, has a strong following among evangelicals,   and gun owners. And while the six electoral votes of Arkansas are already in the bag for Trump this November, Huckabee could help across the Sunbelt. Plus, he’s a good debater. 6) Gov. John Kasich, Ohio, of course, is the swingingest of swing states. And Kasich proved his strength among Buckeyes on March 15 when he won the Ohio primary convincingly. Moreover, Kasich has the right resume: He was a Congressman for 18 years, and has enjoyed two successful terms as governor. He even did a stint at Fox News! Still, there’s the issue of temperament. When a man says that he “would be the worst vice president anybody could ever imagine,” it’s probably important to heed him. 7) Retired Gen. James Mattis, Trump’s whole campaign has been about strong leadership, and it’s hard to think of a stronger leader than this Marine  . Indeed, Mattis is so prominent, and so respected, that the   forces within the Republican Party, led by Bill Kristol, made a strong pitch to Mattis to be their renegade   standard bearer. But Mattis said “no,” and firmly. But is Mattis “political”? Well, nobody climbs as high as Mattis has climbed without knowing the ropes of Washington, DC, as well as the battlefield. Indeed, one of our greatest presidents, Dwight Eisenhower, went from being a   commanding general to being    without missing a beat. What’s mostly unknown, though, is how Mattis gets along with Trump, and how effective he would be as a campaigner. 8) Sen. Marco Rubio, If it’s hard to see Trump picking Cruz, it’s even harder to see Trump picking Rubio  —   who called him, among other nasty things, a “con man. ” But again, things happen: John Kennedy and his top aide, his brother Bobby, both despised Sen. Lyndon Johnson, and yet they picked him, anyway, to be JFK’s running mate in 1960. And yes, LBJ delivered Texas for the Democratic ticket that year, although today, it’s doubtful that Rubio has that sort of muscle in Florida. Yet the even harder question about Rubio is whether he would be loyal to Trump’s agenda. The Floridian did, after all, stake himself out as the   neocon candidate. Indeed, the joke on the campaign trail this year was that Rubio was implicitly promising the restoration of the Bush 43 presidency his roster of donors and advisers was   with old W. hands. So it would certainly be unfortunate for the Trump agenda if his youthful running mate, eyeing his own presidential future, were constantly calculating out a different position. 9) MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, Scarborough has long been a relatively   voice on cable TV, even as he has preserved his reputation as a shrewd and independent analyst. And before that, of course, he was a   Congressman from Florida. Yet his political career ended rather abruptly in 2002, amidst unanswerd questions about the death of a young female staffer in his office. Scarborough was never formally accused of any wrongdoing, but still, the unexplained death of Lori Klausutis is a cloud over Morning Joe. Moreover, more recently, Scarborough may have scuppered any chance he might have when he said that he wouldn’t vote for Trump if Trump stuck by his   positions, such as his proposed ban on Muslim immigration. Could Trump feel compelled to back down on a position because his   running mate told him to?  That’ll be the day. And then, the feud got worse, as Trump and Scarborough got into a Twitter war. By now, Trump will have Megyn Kelly on his ticket before he has Scarborough. 10) Sen. Jeff Sessions, The   Alabama Senator endorsed Trump back in February, when it really mattered. Indeed, months earlier, Sessions had dispatched his key policy aide, Stephen Miller, to the Trump campaign to serve as the New Yorker’s policy adviser  —   and Miller did a great job of articulating Trump’s key issues, notably immigration. This is not surprising, since Sessions has long been the strongest single voice in Congress on restrictive immigration enforcement. Like Gingrich, Sessions is not young  —   he’ll turn 70 later this year  —   but he, too, is obviously vigorous. And Sessions has demonstrated his political mastery not only is he a respected member of the Senate, but, in 2014, he was the only senator seeking   who was completely unopposed in both the primary and the general election. Okay, so that’s the Trump top ten, as Virgil sees them. One could add other names, such as, for example, Sarah Palin. The former Alaska governor was a clutch Trump endorser before Iowa, and that means a lot. But still, Palin is, well, Palin, and so it’s hard to take her seriously as a vice president. She has enormous talent as a politician  —   her speech to the 2008 Republican convention in St. Paul will stand forever as one of the great rock ‘em, sock ‘em campaign orations  —   but she has all too obviously not improved herself since. In addition, we can cite a number of attractive young Republican senators, including Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, and John Thune of South Dakota. Although none of them are known nationally, any of them could be seen as competent and qualified. Yet the greatest single challenge to Trump is, frankly, winning this November. He has to reach 270 electoral votes, something that Republicans have done only twice in the last six elections, and then only barely. In the view of this grizzled veteran, it would be a mistake for Trump to think he can win by following a Karl     strategy that would seek to target a few key swing states, such as Ohio, Colorado, and New Mexico. Such a strategy might work  —   it worked for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, albeit barely  —   but the Democrats are waiting for it. They have that   buzzsaw ready to blaze away, and if they can further concentrate their resources into a handful of key counties in those key states, well, that’s the defensive ambush game the Democrats want to play. And so all that argues against picking a vice president  —   say, Kasich, or Gardner of Colorado, or Martinez of New Mexico  —   just because that pick could possibly deliver his or her home state. So instead of   maybe Trump should try  . That is, aim for the whole country run a   campaign. That’s what Gingrich has been arguing for on Fox News. Indeed, Gingrich can point to his 1994 success with the Contract with America, which brought Republicans control of the House for the first time in four decades. That was exactly the sort of big, bold “air war” that took the Democrats by surprise. Gingrich’s Contract helped the GOP win everywhere they even won two House seats in Massachusetts. In other words, it was exactly the sort of upset victory that Trump now needs, too. Over the last year, Trump has made a point of rejecting stale Republican orthodoxy on a host of issues, from Social Security to Iraq. And so once again, now, as he prepares to make the vital vice presidential decision, he probably needs to reject stale orthodoxy once again. Yes, he needs to swing for the fences, not seek to punch out a single. If Trump can get good wood on the ball, if he and his running mate can really connect with the voters, he’ll have not only a political victory, but also the policy mandate he needs. And that’s the real definition of #Winning.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Exclusive — ‘Don’t Vote for the Lying Witch’: Inside Donald Trump’s Movement-Driven Sunshine State Effort to Defeat Hillary Clinton in Florida - Breitbart</td>\n",
       "        <td>MIAMI, Florida  —   Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump’s unorthodox campaign in Florida is still    with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the latest polls, despite being outmatched in spending in this critical battleground state. The race remains close in large part thanks to the “movement” he often references from the stage at his rallies nationwide. [Over the past several weeks, Breitbart News has spent time with a variety of Trump backers in Florida —  ranging from his campaign’s state   and Florida GOP vice chairman Joe Gruters to grassroots activists and die hard supporters —  to figure out what exactly is driving Trump’s appeal in a state with 29 electoral votes critical to either candidate’s White House chances.  Carlos Arias, a     and die hard Donald Trump supporter, is a Miami native who works as a biomedical professor by day. But, by night, he is on his own dime and with his own time building support for the Trump campaign in the Cuban community here —  using traditional grassroots organizing tactics, and newer ones through social media. As part of his effort, Arias manages the Cubans for Trump Facebook page. But he also walks the streets of Little Havana working his friends, family, and neighbors over to Team Trump. “What’s there not to support about the guy?” Arias told Breitbart News in a   interview before taking reporters on the streets with him. “I mean, he’s an amazing leader. He’s a very intelligent guy. He has an expertise for making deals, for making trade deals, for the economy, for money, for running business. He’s an entrepreneur, he’s a successful family man. He obviously loves his family. ” Jose Uz, a    native Miami resident of Cuban descent, told Breitbart News he’s similarly impressed with Trump’s business acumen. Yet Uz places even more weight on Trump’s desire to help the country —  without any competing interests other than his love for the United States. “I believe that Mr. Donald Trump is an individual that has the best interest for the United States, for America, and for its citizens,” Uz, who runs the   Facebook group Cubans4Trump, said in an interview. “He doesn’t need to prove anything, he doesn’t need to become famous, he doesn’t need to become rich, he is already there  —   on the contrary, this is actually something, when I view it, I say, my God, what a huge burden he has voluntarily placed on himself. It’s almost to the point of masochism. He didn’t need this, he has a privileged beautiful life. One that he has earned with his hard work and intelligence. Why would he do this? There is nothing for him to gain out of it. But there actually is, when you look deep into it. What he actually has to gain is ensuring and securing the future of his children, his grandchildren, and his   and everybody else down the line, and all of us that are within the United States. He is going to secure us in the way of keeping us safe. ” Joe Fernandez, a Cuban immigrant in his late 50s, told Breitbart News he supports Trump for similar reasons. “I believe he is a patriotic man, he knows a lot about international relationships, and business, he will bring some new ideas,” Fernandez said. “He looks like a tough guy. He is from New York. Now a days life is very strong [hard] a lot of difficult times. We need a strong man. ” Ariel Martinez, a    man from Havana now living in Florida whose father and other family members were political prisoners under the Castro regime in Cuba, supports Trump for president as well. He said there is broad support for Trump in the Cuban American community. “The Cuban American community supports Donald J. Trump as the candidate for Presidency because we would like to see America thrive again,” Martinez told Breitbart News. “We want to see God, American values, the love of Country, and Patriotism restored in our great nation. This is primarily important to us because we come from a system that the latter has been substituted for the corrupt ideology of communism. The freedoms in this country, under a two term Obama administration, are slowly being eroded toward a state of socialism and will lead us to a socialist nation. Which is simply a precursor to communism. We, the Cuban American community, believe that Hillary represents a third term of Obama’s ideology which this country cannot afford. For us it is quite simple to see what is slowly unfolding in this great nation of ours because, we didn’t learn it in a history book, we lived it and it is precisely where we are headed. We have found that Donald J. Trump has started a movement, here in South Florida, where all races from everywhere —  Latinos, Hispanics, Blacks, Jews —  have united as one force to show unwavering support for the presidential candidate. We do truly believe that we will witness a   victory that will make history. ” Hillary Rodham Clinton, on the other hand, does not fare so well in the Cuban community. When asked how Trump’s opponent, Clinton, is viewed in the Cuban community in South Florida, Arias used a Spanish word to call her a “witch. ” “They call her a ‘bruja,’ basically,” Arias said is what his friends and neighbors think of Hillary Clinton. “She’s the bruja mentirosa. Which means liar. She’s a lying witch basically. We all know what rhymes with witch, though we’re not going to get into that. She is typically viewed as a liar and dishonest and in it for herself, a typical career politician that doesn’t care about the interests of the Cuban community —  and doesn’t care about the interests of Americans in general. She’s mostly in it for her people and her foundation. ” “I don’t see her ready to take such an important position as President of the United States,” Fernandez said of Clinton. Uz added that she has no idea how to manage the economy. “There is no politician out there especially Hillary Clinton who has any idea of how to manage money because they never actually earned any,” Uz said. “Whether it was ten million or one million, whatever he supposedly borrowed from his father, its no secret that he turned it into a   dollar empire. It’s not a thing about having money, its about knowing how to get that money make it multiply and make it grow. Its about put[ting] together organizations, how to manage them, how to put the right people in the right positions, know[ing] how to delegate to the right individuals and how to create jobs  —   how to be able to create an environment that is friendly for the individual to be able to sustain themselves and their families. Mr. Trump understands very well from having been inside big business his entire adult life, how special interest and cronyism actually works within the government and big business. Politicians don’t know how to earn money, they only know how to take money from special interest groups and lobbyists and enrich themselves from doing favors. Their payouts come later on with consulting jobs and getting paid half a million dollars to speak half and hour to somebody or to a group of people. ” The Cuban leaders found a recent media attack against Trump to be particularly gratuitous. Specifically, the allegation that has surfaced in recent weeks is that Trump was doing business in Cuba in the 1990s —  when it was still illegal to do so. Arias brushed off the report, which came from a NewsWeek piece that claimed Trump was unlawfully doing business in Cuba, as a “cheap attack. ” “A cheap Democratic strategy,” Arias said. “And how convenient [for it to come] right after the first debate where he clearly dominated her?” Fernandez said the attack from NewsWeek was “a lie. ” “He tried to do business [with Cuba] but when he saw how things was, he stopped that immediately,” Fernandez said. Over the course of the past several weeks, Breitbart News has conducted a number of interviews and traveled to a variety of Florida cities —  and Trump events —  to get a feel for how his campaign in the   Sunshine State is shaping up on the ground. For a time at the beginning of September, it seemed Trump had taken a lead in Florida —  a   poll conducted after Labor Day had him up three points over Clinton while a JMC Analytics poll had him up four and a PPP poll and a Suffolk poll each had Trump leading by a single point. But a bevy of other surveys since then —  a Monmouth poll showing Clinton up 5 points, a   poll with her up 4 points, and New York Times and Fox 13 polls with her up one point in each —  have come out dampening his momentum. A new Emerson poll in Florida has Trump up by 1 point, while Quinnipiac and University of North Florida polls have Trump down 5 points and 3 points respectively. A Breitbart News   Marketing survey at the beginning of October had a tie ball game at 46 percent apiece for Trump and Clinton, while the latest   survey released a little over a week ago has Clinton up 4 in Florida with a 2. 3 percent margin of error. A steady stream of surveys since over the middle of the month of October have shown Clinton with either a   or three point lead. All told, the race here in Florida is close: The RealClearPolitics polling average shows Clinton, overall, leading Trump by under 4 percent —  just inside or just outside all the polls’ collective margins of error, too close for comfort for both candidates. Trump shocked the political world just a few short months ago when on March 15 he smoked the Sunshine State’s favorite son Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) in the primary here, leading to the end of the Rubio campaign —  once thought to be the campaign of the eventual   nominee —  by nearly 20 percent. Rubio and Trump have since mostly buried the hatchet, and seem to be working together to win in November. Gruters, Trump’s Florida   who also serves as the vice chairman of the Florida GOP, dismissed any potential idea that there is conflict between Trump supporters and operatives loyal to Rubio. “Because I’m a part of both organizations I know there is no daylight in between electing Donald Trump and Marco in Florida,” Gruters explained. “We all share the same goal of stopping Hillary Clinton and Patrick Murphy’s dangerous agenda. ” But the brutal primary left a bitter taste in some mouths of others throughout the state’s GOP establishment. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another of Trump’s vanquished rivals who he went even harder against to defeat, has broken his pledge to the Republican Party and is refusing to endorse Trump for president. Several others in the Bush family, including Jeb’s father former U. S. President George H. W. Bush and the senior Bush’s granddaughter Barbara, are reportedly supporting Clinton for president. His campaign in the state here has shaken itself up post primaries, with Karen Giorno —  his state director during the primaries who delivered a successful election night back on March 15 —  moving up to New York City while Susie Wiles has taken over the state’s efforts in the general election. Giorno’s move to New York came after reports that she confirmed to Politico that there were disagreements between her and other GOP officials on how to handle resource allocation for the general election. “I won’t sugar coat it. I’ve had serious put professional disagreements with some colleagues about what offices should be open and how they should be rolled out. But there’s nothing nefarious here,” Giorno said after the move, according to Politico. Politico’s Marc Caputo quoted Giorno as attributing some of the blame to “bureaucratic red tape in getting leases signed and getting money out the door. ” But, Giorno said in the early September report: “Susie Wiles is a winner. She knows how to win. ” Gruters told Breitbart News in hindsight that this move has proven to be a sign of the team’s success, since Giorno has been invaluable —  sources in the national campaign confirm to Breitbart News —  up in New York while Wiles has been getting the trains moving on time in Florida. “Susie Wiles will take what Karen created and take Karen’s team and make sure we win,” Gruters said. “I think Karen did a fantastic job. I credit Karen, I credit Susan, I credit the team, and I have no doubt we are going win. ” The real question is —  with such a   operation in the primaries, and a similarly skeletal operation in the general election —  how did Trump win so big back on March 15? And why is he still in the game when Clinton is outspending him at an unbelievable clip? For anyone other than Trump, seemingly, the lack of support from such party luminaries as former presidents like the Bushes would be a   for their campaigns. But Trump, somehow, is hanging on —  and has a chance here on Nov. 8. Maybe it is because the election isn’t about him, but about an amorphous political movement that has gotten behind him since early in the primaries a nationalist, populist movement that rejects the thinking of the political elite —  and the status quo —  and instead represents more of a grassroots rebellion against the political class than a typical Republican versus Democrat battle. At Trump’s rallies throughout the state of Florida —  and really everywhere in the country —  he’s drawing thousands and thousands of people, many of whom never have been involved in politics before. Trump’s strategy, aides note, seems to be focused on targeting the most expensive battleground state’s ten separate media markets with massive rallies, taking whatever earned media he can get, and building excitement on a grassroots level via social media and making rallies as fun as they can. At a recent rally up in the   corridor of Melbourne, Florida, near Orlando, for instance, three millennial women told Breitbart News that Trump’s plan is working.  On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Trump is   the Sunshine State yet again with a rally in Naples on Sunday, rallies in St. Augustine and Tampa on Monday and a rally in Sanford on Tuesday.  Trump seems to gather his   campaign style from his career in business. He does not look at campaigning like a traditional politician, and he baffled the pundits and political consultants throughout the primaries by successfully storming his way to the nomination with less than 100 staffers compared to what amounted to standing armies his opponents like Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) had built. Since he has become the GOP nominee, he has rounded his campaign out with many more staff nationwide —  at the headquarters up at Trump Tower in New York City and throughout the states like this —  but he still has that businessman mentality at heart. The challenge he faces is building a winning campaign without losing his flair, and without sacrificing his style. Trump’s Florida team, despite the usual suspects in the prognosticating business bashing them, says everything is going according to plan. “The media is pushing this narrative that Hillary should be winning because she has more    offices than we do,” Gruters said. “We only had two    offices in the primary and we won 66 of 67 counties. We are going to knock on 120, 000 doors just this Saturday alone. ” Recent reports from   publications in the progressive media —  including Politico, the Huffington Post, and the New York Times —  have suggested that Trump is not organized in Florida. “The story told by the media is that we have no ground game in Florida,” Gruters said in an email. “As our boss likes to say, ‘the proof is in the pudding. ’” Gruters detailed for Breitbart News exactly what is going on in the state for Trump: Meanwhile, while Trump builds his army and his momentum —  all while crashing through Florida whenever possible with major   rallies —  Clinton is slipping. Even the New York Times recently lamented her dreary Florida weather in an article titled: “Hillary Clinton Struggles To Gain Traction in Florida, Despite Spending. ” “Hillary Clinton has vastly outspent Donald J. Trump on TV ads in Florida. Her 57 campaign offices dwarf Mr. Trump’s afterthought of a ground game. And Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular among Hispanics, who account for nearly one in five Florida voters,” Trip Gabriel wrote for the Times on Sept. 17 under that headline. “Despite these advantages, Mrs. Clinton is struggling in the Sunshine State, unable to assemble the coalition that gave Barack Obama two victories here, and offering Mr. Trump a broad opening in a road to the White House that not long ago seemed closed to him. Mr. Trump is pressing down hard to win the state, campaigning in Miami on Friday and in Fort Myers on Monday, after a rally in Pensacola recently. ” Politico came out with a hit even harder more than a week later, just a few days ago, writing in a headline that Clinton was in “panic mode” with black voters in Florida. “To kill Donald Trump’s chances of capturing the White House, Hillary Clinton needs to win Florida. And to do that, she needs a big minority turnout,” Marc Caputo and Daniel Ducassi wrote on Sept. 28 in Politico. “But Democrats are beginning to worry that too many   voters are uninspired by Clinton’s candidacy, leading her campaign to hit the panic button this week and launch an   blitz to   voter enthusiasm. ” Trump is bolstering   establishment political infrastructure with energy, enthusiasm, new voters, and motivated volunteers. The Trump campaign is depending on that infrastructure to provide the ground game for voter engagement and turnout. Trump’s primary campaign outperformed the primary campaigns of both Sen. John McCain in 2008 and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012. Andy Badolato, who in addition to contributing to Breitbart News serves as an elected GOP committeeman in Sarasota County  in Florida, explained it this way: “Trump set new primary GOP records in Florida receiving almost 50 percent more votes than Romney did in 2012 despite running against Florida resident favorites Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson as well as defeating handily Ted Cruz. ” Badolato added that Gruters has been crucial to the whole effort. “Joe Gruters demonstrated courage and leadership in the face of great personal risk and political adversity in backing Trump very early and leading his campaign in Florida,” Badolato said. “Joe was ostracized, ridiculed and attempts were made by his own peers and close friends to oust him out of many organizations and associations. Joe Gruters recognized the issues of what the Florida electorate really wanted and it was clearly not an establishment candidate. ” According to Gruters, he started supporting Trump after presenting Trump with the Sarasota Republican Party’s “Statesman of the Year” award in 2012. “I knew early on that Trump is going to be our President, he’s an agent of change and he’s going to give all of us a chance,” Gruters said. “Every time something negative came out it just further convinced me that I had made the right call. All the comments, negativity, and everything else just made me stronger because I knew in 2012 Trump was special. ” For Gruters, all the credit goes to the “all star” Florida campaign team and the man at the top of the ticket. “Trump is going to be one of the best President’s we’ve ever had and it all gets to two things, security and jobs and the economy,” Gruters said. But while the campaign staff and party players sort out the details, what seems to keep Trump afloat right next to Clinton is that completely organic “movement” that people like Arias represent. To further highlight the opposition to Clinton —  and support for Trump —  in Miami’s Cuban community, Arias invited Breitbart News cameras to follow him as he stumped for Trump in Little Havana in Miami.  And Uz, similarly, has a message for all his fellow Cuban Americans throughout South Florida. “This is the last stop,” Uz warns his friends and neighbors. “If we lose America there is no place else to go. You were lucky enough when you lost Cuba, you had a generous wonderful country, that opened its arms to all of us and allowed you to come in [and] establish your families, expand your education, open businesses, raise your children in freedom, and to live a prosperous good life. If we lose America to socialism, there is no where else to go. Please, please don’t be stupid, don’t listen to the rhetoric. Fidel Castro killed millions of Cubans with his rhetoric, and we fell for it. Please don’t fall for it twice. ”</td>\n",
